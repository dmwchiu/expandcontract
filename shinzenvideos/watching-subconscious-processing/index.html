                <p>But.</p>
<p>Bot bot.</p>
<p>There's another possibility.</p>
<p>And this one is yet another subtlety, but it is so cool once you get it.</p>
<p>OK and I'm not sure this is what you're talking about, but it's something that I have to talk about.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>So, sometimes I'll</p>
<p>Be working with the first time are there doing focus in and they elect to do it with inclusive noting it's just I give them the option and it's like. Hey, you know it's going to be sort of complicated. Now it's natural. I want to do it that way.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So we're doing CN Urine Feelin.</p>
<p>See here in the sea feel in your field in all in.</p>
<p>Gone all rest.</p>
<p>Pawn.</p>
<p>And the person reports this.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>It's not all rest.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>It's not, but I</p>
<p>I can tell you whether what it is OK. I can't say it, see in here in feo in or what combination but it's not all rest. It's not that.</p>
<p>There's no image no talk no emotion in the body. It's not all rest, but I can't tell you.</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>Sounds like a problem.</p>
<p>But actually it's not a problem.</p>
<p>It's the beginning of something really cool.</p>
<p>On.</p>
<p>What's happening on So what you say is?</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p>You're not aware of explicit image talk or emotional body.</p>
<p>But those spaces.</p>
<p>Are also not in a restful state?</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>Or what do you think is going?</p>
<p>Seattle process.</p>
<p>Subconscious processing.</p>
<p>So the whole western psychological tradition is based on Freud's quote discovery of the subconscious. How guess Wat. People in India knew about the subconscious.</p>
<p>Two 3000 years before there was a Floyd in Europe.</p>
<p>Ah am they knew how to observe the subconscious in real time.</p>
<p>Now you can't observe the subconscious visual auditory in somatic the way you observe the conscious because by definition, it subconscious.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>However, you can be aware when a burst of activity arises in Subconscious thought and emotion, and you can be aware when that burst of activity passes.</p>
<p>On.</p>
<p>How are you aware of that? Well sometimes you're aware because of a shimmering on the screen that tells you that the rolodex is being flipped through deep down where there's this sort of undercurrent of talk.</p>
<p>Anna it's massively parallel like listening to a room full of People. You can't make out any strand of a conversation but you know.</p>
<p>Stuff going on down there. Same for this sort of like a idling in your emotional centers.</p>
<p>Nothings engaged you can't say it's anger fear sadness but.</p>
<p>Speed the emotional centers are sort of an Idol you can actually see it in a baby. You can see the.</p>
<p>The amoeba that is the.</p>
<p>The idling of the Olympic circuits in a baby. The baby is not crying. The babies not smiling OK but the baby is sort of.</p>
<p>This kind of stuff OK that's their body, responding to.</p>
<p>The sub threshold activations.</p>
<p>Of the limbic system.</p>
<p>OK let's just expanding and contracting while still there in adults. So one way that you can know that you can monitor in real time, these systems.</p>
<p>Is by noting sort of subtle activities subtle flow within them?</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>This is the part that's really cool and really subtle.</p>
<p>You may not even be aware of that undercurrent.</p>
<p>Or something.</p>
<p>But you're aware.</p>
<p>That image space is tugging.</p>
<p>Talks spaces tugging you.</p>
<p>Emotional feeling spaces, tugging it, but there's no no awareness of any activity that there's an awareness of a tug of space. That's why it's so important to have a sense of the locations of the spaces.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>When it's not you're doing focusing and it's not all rest.</p>
<p>You will notice that the non rest is that you're being tugged towards 1, two or all three of those spaces.</p>
<p>That is the queue that there is a very at that instant.</p>
<p>Kind of the subconscious mind has started to activate.</p>
<p>In one tour all three of those spaces. All you an you note that as CN here, and feeling even though so it's not all rest. There's no explicit activity that you're aware of not even though Vibra. Tori flow, but there is this tug.</p>
<p>That's why this triangle OK. There's a ton here there's a tongue here there's like a tongue down here or all three of months or what have you that tongue when your emphasis is on detecting interactivity that counts as the sub list level of interactivity and you just say yes, even though you don't know what you're saying yes to you say yes to the Top and guess what?</p>
<p>At some point that's all that the subjective system needs. It just needs you to say yes to its amoeboid subliminal fluffs and you go back to that state of the baby.</p>
<p>And that's the extent to which the ego needs to be a thing for you, which ain't much of a thing.</p>
<p>This was hugely subtle.</p>
<p>Don't worry. I'll say it again and again and again.</p>
