                  <h1>3 Key Moments for Shinzen Young</h1>
                
                <p>So, in your probably early experiences with meditation can you recall any key moments when you realized experientially that wo?</p>
<p>This is this is shifting the nature of my experience in a way I hadn't expected.</p>
<p>Probably the first T moment.</p>
<p>Came a few months into the practice.</p>
<p>When I started to notice that at the end of our set.</p>
<p>The Voice that had always been screaming in my head.</p>
<p>Although it was still present it was like, at a distance. It wasn't screaming anymore.</p>
<p>I didn't have to listen to it.</p>
<p>Instantly I never experienced anything like that was like the internal talk by the end of a set the internal talk hadn't gone away. But he was like, at a distance who was muffled.</p>
<p>That wasn't you know.</p>
<p>Whole New World for me.</p>
<p>So I went to my teacher and I said, my sitting scotting getting interesting and he said. Oh, in what way and I described this phenomenon.</p>
<p>And he said Oh that's good, you're starting to go into Samadi.</p>
<p>Into a state of high concentration.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Then he said now you have anything that you experience on the cushion.</p>
<p>You must eventually be able to experience in daily life.</p>
<p>And I thought This is crazy. I could barely get a little heut of that quieting of internal talk.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>After an hour of focusing on my breath? How can I possibly maintain this in daily life and he said. Well, you can just do it that was a pivotal experience that was really new and something that who would have ever thought. That was possible for someone like me to experience even a few moments of quiet of internal self talk.</p>
<p>I would say the second dramatic thing that ever happened to me came.</p>
<p>At the end of my first week long. Zen retreat in Japan, which was this <strong>*</strong> Riffic killer ordeal. It was in the summer very first night they like broke 3 sticks over People think the mosquitoes like an inch long that could bite you through your clothes.</p>
<p>And it was like you know, Japan is very moist, so In summary you're just like sweating right.</p>
<p>And you're not allowed to move at all. No matter what and by the way this is a good example of what I mean by horrifically bills that I would like People, not to have to go through by working smart with precise vocabulary. But.</p>
<p>Because if we talk about this People say, Hey, you know who would ever put themselves in that they don't see themselves in that scenario.</p>
<p>So you don't have to do this kind of thing, but the first time I did do. That kind of thing I buy the and I nearly had lost my marbles. I was starting to have insane ideations, literally insane thoughts.</p>
<p>Like a torture victim basically and my whole body was shaking with pain and I thought I was going to cry. I was, I was sure I was just going to start bawling.</p>
<p>And it was the last.</p>
<p>Set of the last day.</p>
<p>And I was just holding on and in my whole body was shaking and I was just holding on for dear life.</p>
<p>And I realized I was about to cry, but not just crime, I mean ball breakdown.</p>
<p>And I started to scream in my talk space. You're not a baby. Don't Cry. You're not a baby? Don't cry like that over and over again.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Suddenly.</p>
<p>For no reason.</p>
<p>I dropped into equanimity.</p>
<p>Big time.</p>
<p>It wasn't just the quiet OK that I've described before my entire being dropped into a spontaneous equanimity.</p>
<p>The way you know that's happened is the pain level is.</p>
<p>Exactly the same but the suffering level.</p>
<p>Dramatically.</p>
<p>Reduces or perhaps even goes away.</p>
<p>And in this particular instance.</p>
<p>The suffering completely went away, so I went from.</p>
<p>Near fainting level of pain.</p>
<p>To my body totally relaxed.</p>
<p>Yes, the internal talk turned off.</p>
<p>And the pain turned to do a kind of flowing enerji that was just massage in my being.</p>
<p>And it was like I could have stayed there forever. The physical body was literally breaking up into a flow of spirit.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Then the Bell Rang.</p>
<p>That ended that set.</p>
<p>I was never the same because.</p>
<p>You know you can hear somebody say this but.</p>
<p>If you haven't experienced it. Why should you believe it and I would have never believed that that could be the case.</p>
<p>So that was extremely dramatic a few years later, one day at the end of day, I sat down. I haven't meditated that day, I was doing self inquiry at that time.</p>
<p>Asking, who am I.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, I sat down and I said, who am I. I looked at my boundaries.</p>
<p>And they vanished.</p>
<p>And they never came back.</p>
<p>And I was tired, the same ever I didn't said I just got up.</p>
<p>I got up I just started to walk around and communicate with the walls.</p>
<p>And they were.</p>
<p>Me.</p>
<p>And so is the whole world.</p>
<p>And next morning, you want to went to bed that night. I thought well that's going to go away, you know it's like.</p>
<p>Woke up the next morning.</p>
<p>It was there an it never went away ever my whole life, I was, I've been privileged.</p>
<p>That was after I'd meditated for about.</p>
<p>For years, so it's been 40 years now, so I like 3536 years ago.</p>
<p>And it has nothing to do with Out concentrated your heart is just is.</p>
<p>That was obviously huge watershed there that's what gives me the confidence to teach.</p>
