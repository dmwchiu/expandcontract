                  <h1>AUTO WALK demonstrated by SHINZEN YOUNG</h1>
                
                <p>Really?</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I like to give People the option of practicing every kind of meditation technique that has ever been developed developed in the history of world mysticism. and I have this sort of grid where I classify all the techniques like a periodic table of meditation strategies, so I try to include in that everything that.</p>
<p>It was a major invention or a major innovation somethings in meditative technology of only been discovered once many things have been discovered many times in different cultures.</p>
<p>So one thing that as far as I know was only strongly emphasized once is the notion of expressing spontaneity through how you move? How you speak and the motor part of how you think.</p>
<p>This is an aspect of liberation practice that was very much appreciated.</p>
<p>And developed within the Chan School of Chinese practice, particularly associated originally with the master name mods who and that eventually evolved into the Linji or renzy as it's called in Japanese School of Zen so they put a big emphasis on.</p>
<p>Manifesting impermanence manifesting emptiness manifesting non self in how you move the body how you sort of channeled the words that are coming through your lips and eventually also learning how to?</p>
<p>Think without thinking so there's sort of like if you do without thinking it's just happening this and it's merged with the dynamic emptiness of nature, young in if you speak without thinking same thing. A little trickier is to think without thinking. But it's the same general idea, it turns into thoughts that are spontaneous creative.</p>
<p>Wise and so forth so traditionally in Buddhism, they speak of the 3:00 Karma Dvora. The 3 gates of actions Kayavak Cheetah Archive at Maná means bottling motions speech actions and thought actions so I.</p>
<p>Have in my repertoire of techniques a quadrant of training that I call spontaneity training and I teach People how to access spontaneity and body movement speech thought and even all 3:00 at the same time, so my word just to have a convenient word for this just happening empty but rich dynamic quality.</p>
<p>In motion that will work for it. I call it auto from the original Greek meaning spontaneous corresponds to certain Asian concepts. the Chinese notion of Iran, which is she's in in Japanese.</p>
<p>And there's many words in Tibetan that have this connotation of effortless just happening anyway. I call it auto to have a word for it. So there's a technique of auto walk or more broadly, auto move auto speak and specific example of that would be auto chat, which is relatively easy to do and then I even have an auto think technique so the way you do.</p>
<p>Or auto move is you just sort of tune into some motion that your body already knows how to do and you just sort of follow the reflex. You taste the reflex miss the fact that the motor circuits know how to do it without there needing to be much of thinking ego for it to happen. So it's like being a little kid little kids walk. They just walk for the fun spontaneity or they?</p>
<p>Run for the fund spontaneity or they you know like play around in puddles of water or whatever 'cause it's just like.</p>
<p>Just happens and they enjoy that just happening iness of it, so to do the auto walk you.</p>
<p>Tune into the fact that your body knows how to walk without meeting are you.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>And it's a little intuitive I can't really describe quite how to do it, but you just sort of get a feel for it with time in the monastery the way that People learn about this is by watching other People do it during the word periods or as you're walking from place to place People do this sort of just walking thing. The more senior monks and then you sort of pick up on it, so I'm going to show you my particular way of.</p>
<p>Doing the auto walk and it's not I'm pretty poorly coordinated so it's not very going to be very elegant. But there will be a kind of spontaneity to it, so just sort of let you late Kerry.</p>
<p>No, I said it defocus. The gays and it's just sort of happening and it's sort of fun. It's like you're being a little kid again.</p>
<p>Now I add a feature that is not required, which is engaged the visual field. It seems In addition to this sort of my legs, not to carry me without me.</p>
<p>As I'm moving, it seems like the vision visual field is expanding in front.</p>
<p>But the thing that I just saw an instant ago is collapsing behind me. So it's like being a Boulis being carried in this funnel of expanding light.</p>
<p>In front and contracting light behind and then I combine that with the sort of spontaneity of the movement of the legs and it's like space itself is just sort of caring is come along. I'm exaggerating now. This silly usually but you get the general idea.</p>
<p>It's just so many expansion and contraction and the legs are just sort of move in with their own.</p>
<p>Could just like playing like this for a long time and it's rich because it's dynamic. It's bouncy, but it's empty because there's no in there.</p>
<p>That was me, making shinzen do auto walk for everyone on YouTube. Shin heads everywhere and tomorrow. I'm going to get him to do auto walk while auto talking auto speaking while auto thinking so stay tuned for more.</p>
