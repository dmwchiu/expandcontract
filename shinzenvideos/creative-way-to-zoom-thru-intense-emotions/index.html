                <p>Now you know how you know.</p>
<p>Like in a ghost movie.</p>
<p>You see that, like the ghost can walk through the wall right right there goes passes through the wall to wall gives no resistance. Now imagine you didn't have a ghost in the wall, but you had 2 ghosts.</p>
<p>And they were both.</p>
<p>Doing their own thing.</p>
<p>But they could pass through each other without disturbing each other.</p>
<p>When they occupied the same place at the same time, so you can have these 2 ghostly waves.</p>
<p>One flavored fear the other flavors sad and there, so did dancing except in unlike physical dancers. They parts of them even all of them can occupy the same place.</p>
<p>So they?</p>
<p>They're constantly waving and the waves pass through each other without disturbing each other without developing pressure areas where they would clash does this metaphor makes sense. Yeah.</p>
<p>Have you attempted to do this with the fear and sad not in this not this round. This may be the part of the missing piece because you could get them individually default. But then the next step is collectively default because if they both flow at the same time, interpenetrating wherever they need to without interfering then.</p>
<p>They won't multiply together into over well.</p>
<p>And that so the ability to have more than one flavor.</p>
<p>And to separate the flavors have all the flavors flow and then have the flow fields. Interpenetrate without interference is a sequence that I take People through when they're going through big challenges that are.</p>
<p>That are Poly Chromatic.</p>
<p>IMO at the Poly Chromatic.</p>
<p>Body distress, meaning a lot of different colors in the body then we need to train. The colors to flow through each other time and into Kingsley Dance. It's an interesting.</p>
<p>Intimacy between them.</p>
<p>It's like they're dancing through each other as well as with each other and to the extent that they're both flowing.</p>
<p>You'll get an even more powerful flavor purification and and hopefully a significantly deeper sense of relief.</p>
<p>Cape Cod House at coming.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Pretty much.</p>
<p>When I when I can.</p>
<p>Allow them both to share the same space and not and I'm recognizing how I've been keeping them separate and keeping the line between them in an when I allow them to just kind of do that. The kind of joy. I talked about before with the fear it's very intense version of that and then it kind of seems to ignite this kind of PT like enerji up the body and it gets very hot but it's getting.</p>
<p>It's it's in Rapture Rifier itself is rather counter intuitive facial expression proves it. Yeah, it's really interesting because, as it does, I find myself wanting to comment on it, and I'll go up and talk a minute and then and then it loses it a little bit, yeah, and you have to come out to be done purely in the yeah.</p>
<p>The the comments and then it does triggers of little tacos to go visit there. All about it in your use of practice allows you to say that in not sort of go down that yeah well. Pressly's motivation to kind of stay with this, it's kind.</p>
<p>It's it's intrinsically rewarding no next step. See if you can have the fear in the sadness.</p>
<p>Dancing with, and through each other with your eyes open.</p>
<p>And he may find be focusing the eyes initially.</p>
<p>Helpful.</p>
<p>So we can maintain it somewhat into more ordinary experience.</p>
<p>It's interesting when I am.</p>
<p>'Cause I kind of go in and out here as I do it and I'm going to talk all keeping my eyes open, but</p>
<p>I'm getting to where I'm horning in on the one specific place in the body. They both share in a powerful way an if I can just kind of keep track of flow there, letting it be, whether it's red or blue you know.</p>
<p>It.</p>
<p>It kind of helps maintain it with my eyes open.</p>
