                  <h1>SHINZEN's BILLION DOLLAR HYPOTHESIS</h1>
                
                <p>Another thing that's happening is.</p>
<p>I'm on to the single most exciting science research Prospekt of my career and my idea is right.</p>
<p>Well, you'll see it will definitely see anything you want to hear the expansion and contraction on my idea, yeah, OK. Let's start with expansion.</p>
<p>Should we start with let's start with the expansion so you know it's a big thing for me?</p>
<p>The.</p>
<p>What I called the philosophy of?</p>
<p>The American philosopher Harry I don't know if you know her if you've ever followed. Harry it's got a weird first name, Dirty Dirty.</p>
<p>Dirty Harry pretty much summed it up when I mean, you sexist language, but that was just his character after freaking him for that. But the single very important philosophical point that comes across from dirty Harry is a man's got to know his limitations.</p>
<p>So what does that have to do with anything well?</p>
<p>There is a general tendency for People that have deep and authentic mystical experience to make broader claims about that, then are justified I think.</p>
<p>Don't don't get me wrong, it's still the best thing ever ever ever for our species.</p>
<p>But typically People that have these kinds of experiences claim that they have a special knowledge of the ultimate nature of nature and they have the final answer for everything.</p>
<p>And I think that that's irresponsible claim.</p>
<p>And irresponsible claims may seem.</p>
<p>Innocuous enough, but they can poison our relationship to the scientific world.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Cousin science, but one thing you are not allowed to do is make you responsible plans. You have to have evidence and you have to have logic and it has to be when it has to be tested and tested in many locations around the world for decades, and decades before it's allowed to be called a theory.</p>
<p>OK, so it's a big deal, so because I am very colored by.</p>
<p>The philosophy of jury had dirty Harry which is the philosophy of science. I don't like to make irresponsible claims. Why am I going to say that 'cause I'm about to say something it's going to sound like the most ego maniacal Randy owes delusional claim that you've ever heard. We make but that's going to be the expensive side. Then I'm going to show you the contraction that it's really not what you what you might think.</p>
<p>So I'm onto an idea that object ivli absolutely.</p>
<p>Incontrovertible E is worth billions of dollars.</p>
<p>I got a billion multi billion dollar idea.</p>
<p>OK and that is not a unexaggerated clamp I'll stand by it.</p>
<p>OK, but now you have to hear the contractive side whenever anybody says something what's the first thing you have to do is? What's your definition of X right?</p>
<p>We talked about that over and over and over again so.</p>
<p>By what criterion am I evaluating the monetary value of this idea is the natural question. Paske I'm evaluating it by the criterion of what?</p>
<p>Of the way all science projects are evaluated what statistics statisticians call expected value or expectation value.</p>
<p>And that is the value of success multiplied by the probability of success.</p>
<p>OK follow him, saying that C expected value its basic statistics.</p>
<p>So what I gave you was not the value of the idea of its successful.</p>
<p>I gave you the expected value, the value of the idea if it's successful is vastly more than a billion dollars.</p>
<p>So what does that mean? Yes, but probability of success is not really big?</p>
<p>I give it 1000 to one now you might think well.</p>
<p>That's a real let down.</p>
<p>They call it blue Sky Research or moon shot OK. It's actually an important aspect of science is fact. Some philosophers of science would say that Blue Sky Research is the single most important kind of research to do in science.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Projects that have a reasonable probability of success with a huge payoff.</p>
<p>But one in 1000, is actually a reasonable properly every idea. I've ever come up with before has been one in a million one in a billion.</p>
<p>Not very likely OK.</p>
<p>This is better it's one in 1000.</p>
<p>But still, it's one of the 1000 so do the math. OK, however, the payoff would be trillions and trillions in monetary it would change the course of human history. Can you can put a price on that just figure out what the price of the world is?</p>
<p>And then do some nontrivial percentage of that some percentage of that.</p>
<p>So anyway, I got an idea.</p>
<p>And I've got scientists think it's reasonable and I've got People that are willing to pay for the research.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>That's really, really cool, but it's also.</p>
<p>Something I have to devote some time to so there's that I've already told you what the idea is actually.</p>
<p>It's actually on the YouTube. The last person that interviewed me. I'm laid it all out. If you're interested. I think it was the.</p>
<p>The last interview meant that gasp gasp. Maybe that one. I was talking about 8th. I'm <strong>*</strong> on the Basal Ganglia. Neural modulation and that was the last time someone. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I talked about it at the end, one of the so.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>It involves my favorite disorder, yeah, I have a favorite disorder. It's a neurological rare neurological disorder.</p>
<p>It's horrible don't get me wrong when it happens to People it's horrible horrible horrible.</p>
<p>But it may have a huge silver line.</p>
<p>Um for research and even for those People actually if my hypothesis is correct, you can look it up on Wikipedia. It's called a thym Warmia ATHYMHORMIA.</p>
<p>Up.</p>
<p>You can read a popular article about it in Scientific American mind 2005. The article has the rather intriguing title of the drowning of Mister M or no no, I'm sorry drowning Mister AM.</p>
<p>Which is polacca Ath why well?</p>
<p>Now, once again words and their actual meaning.</p>
<p>I'm going to tell you the Greek origins, but that's not what the condition means. It's just what People called it So what does thymos mean in Greek THYMOS?</p>
<p>I'll give you a hint this timea, you find me Alexa time? Yeah.</p>
<p>It's what I call feel in or its emotion. Thymus is emotion.</p>
<p>And what's horn made me I'll give you a hint hormone, they stimulate you.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>So it's</p>
<p>Uh means stimulation over motivation.</p>
<p>A is an Alpha privative which means without so if you just look at the words. It seems to be, it seems to refer to a condition where there is no emotion or motivation a TH I'm or Mia.</p>
<p>Here is a condition.</p>
<p>Horme is motivation or gap motivation. Simos is emotion. So A is with us so the word seems to mean but does not in its essence actually mean.</p>
<p>Our condition of of no emotion, and no motivation.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>And the spelling ATHYMORMIA.</p>
<p>Also, sometimes called a thigh performing syndrome is a syndrome, which is actually makes it interesting because it can be caused by a wide variety.</p>
<p>Of.</p>
<p>Lesions.</p>
<p>In different locations and of different origins and they can even happen at different times in a person's life.</p>
<p>But if they happen in just the right place on both sides.</p>
<p>Of just the right circuit in the Basal Ganglia.</p>
<p>You develop a caricature not stream entry.</p>
<p>Lot of once returner.</p>
<p>I love non returner.</p>
<p>You develop a caricature. I hope you all here? What caricature means not the real thing.</p>
<p>A bizarre something like.</p>
<p>Are Hot Chip fall in love full liberation complete breaking of the identification of the mind body process total freedom from desire.</p>
<p>And the ability to experience pain of any sort apparently without any suffering.</p>
<p>And the ability to maintain.</p>
<p>Total metal tranquility indefinitely.</p>
<p>As a pathological state.</p>
<p>With a well defined, physical origin.</p>
<p>OK so of course under all neuro psych.</p>
<p>Medical professional sees a <strong>*</strong> riffic disorder.</p>
<p>Up.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>A caricature of full liberation.</p>
<p>With a known physical cause purely biophysical cause.</p>
<p>And a biophysical cause that any first year medical student.</p>
<p>Would immediately see an X Ray?</p>
<p>OK so it's nothing esoteric in that regard, but the effect on the human being is bizarre.</p>
<p>The other name for this condition is.</p>
<p>Is much more revealing?</p>
<p>It's mostly been studied by a handful of doctors in France.</p>
<p>Ah and the French name is pop PAP.</p>
<p>Parent.</p>
<p>Go to active aseum see chic.</p>
<p>Pad.</p>
<p>Is Los?</p>
<p>Bill.</p>
<p>Auto Octave Ossium of auto of inner auto activation, they cannot boot Personhood from the inside Camera.</p>
<p>Not enlightened person.</p>
<p>Can manifest it or D manifested as?</p>
<p>The conditions warrant and the IT is Inter activation.</p>
<p>Up.</p>
<p>People with this disorder.</p>
<p>Are stuck on no self?</p>
<p>Unless you activate them from the outside in which case in the most ideal perfect case of a 5. Warmia the lesions are not are like Goldilocks, not too big not too small if there just in the right just the right size and just the right in the.</p>
<p>Classic.</p>
<p>Case when you activate that person from the outside by speaking to them, they're completely normal.</p>
<p>But unless you keep activating them within a minute are too they fall back to.</p>
<p>Are sort of bizarre Noble silence?</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>This to me is intriguing it is not a subtle.</p>
<p>Then drowning Mister am is about someone who first noticed this condition, while he was swimming in his power.</p>
<p>In his backyard.</p>
<p>Um and the way he noticed it is that he no longer felt any need to swim or move his body.</p>
<p>Now it's true his head was in the water and therefore he was breathing water.</p>
<p>Um and he knew that he could turn his head anytime he wanted but breathing waterproofing error. Different is aware of that. He's falling sinking to the bottom of the pool and then he's dying.</p>
<p>But being alive being dead, not so different is.</p>
<p>Daughter comes out sees what's going on screams and reactivates his normal self preservation, he flails surface and doesn't die?</p>
<p>Hence the intriguing title of the essay in Scientific American drowning Mister M.</p>
<p>Send your book, yeah, maybe I mentioned it briefly well, I've been looking a lot deeper into it.</p>
<p>A lot deeper and it's not an easy subject of a game to scientifically.</p>
<p>Functional neuroanatomy at that level is not well understood.</p>
<p>But in any event.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>It's a caricature.</p>
<p>But it has some overlap.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>It's</p>
<p>It's nothing mysterious or abstract.</p>
<p>It's</p>
<p>Grossly physical.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>So to me the fact that it's stunningly dramatic.</p>
<p>And that it has some overlap.</p>
<p>Don't know exactly what the relationship is I mean, it is a disorder but it's overlaps. It not just one or two ways and overlaps in about 1/2 dozen ways.</p>
<p>With what we're spending our lives trying to achieve here.</p>
<p>On.</p>
<p>So that combination of we know physically exactly what's happening and it has an overlap and it can happen within a week or a few minutes.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>And it has an overlap many intersections with.</p>
<p>What takes a lifetime to achieve?</p>
<p>With practice is not the whole picture Dem.</p>
<p>You know what I soon as I talk about that People they think I'm stupid or something they think I'm equating this with what we want or they think I think this is the whole picture of what we wanted not naive.</p>
<p>But I am saying that something's really jump out in this.</p>
<p>As Possible Research Ave.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Not so much to make.</p>
<p>They have.</p>
<p>Physical interview my paradigm is not so much. Oh, we're going to figure out a way to accelerate meditation.</p>
<p>I'm much more grandiose.</p>
<p>My Paradinas was going to simply make liberation part of standard Medison everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>How could that possibly be?</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>What what's wrong? What's the difference between a time Hormilla and being are hot?</p>
<p>I told you I told you what the similarities are.</p>
<p>But our Hut compacted him well. That's certainly one difference. I didn't hear that are hot can activate itself. If need be so I can show you the similarities. I could show you the differences.</p>
<p>And then I can make some conjecture about how we may be able to.</p>
<p>Get the baby and throw away the bathwater so to speak metaphor make sense the baby being the liberation of the jewel in the Lotus So what is different well clearly one thing that's different? Is see this is the condition is so.</p>
<p>Is so?</p>
<p>Complexing to doctors the few doctors that know about it or if researched it. It's very rare by the way very rare because, like I say the lesions have to be in exactly the right spot and exactly the right size.</p>
<p>If there not big enough or not in the right locations. Then you won't get this dramatic effect if there are 2 big or in the wrong locations. You get a whole bunch of other effects that basically leave that person.</p>
<p>Totally disabled and they you can't boot a self by talking to them, they have? What's called a kinetic mutism there. Just you can't see the thing about 8:00 time for me, it is on the surface. It looks like a kinetic mutism. Akinetic mutism means you no longer move and you no longer talk, but you're not in a coma.</p>
<p>You're not paralyzed you're not sat even somnolent.</p>
<p>Um you're not depressed.</p>
<p>But you just no longer talk or move ever so you might as well be in a persistent picture. That's a fight. That's the extreme case of a kinetic mutism. That's when you get the lesions similar lesions, but they're too big.</p>
<p>And then they just wipe you out, but this is expansion and contraction. It's just right so that it leaves. It leaves the possibility that just by speaking their back to normal without cognitive or behavioral deficit for about a minute.</p>
<p>So you have to keep activating them.</p>
<p>Of course, if someone were to simply create an app that talked to them all day.</p>
<p>Presumably they'd be back to normal.</p>
<p>And let's see who knows how to design those kinds of apps.</p>
<p>I think I do.</p>
<p>Up.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Uh so one difference is you can't.</p>
<p>We can't manifest self.</p>
<p>I will let you are dependent on another person manifesting, drawing it out of him, but in the most ideal case.</p>
<p>There are actually just normal OK for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Uhm I actually have a student who was a neuro Psych Evaluator, who had this condition in a patient and he's one of my facilitators back E teaches neuroscience now actually but he wrote up a case study and he confirmed for me. Just on his anecdote that absolutely that's what it was like.</p>
<p>The guy never complained.</p>
<p>He's been a math Prof at one of the New York University is the patient. And if you ask him to deliver electron advanced math, you could do it just fine.</p>
<p>If you kept him going.</p>
<p>But if you went away it would just sit there and look at you wouldn't even wouldn't move all day day after day.</p>
<p>That's Subtle Croquet and the size of these lesions.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Rye screen.</p>
<p>But bilateral or a few rice grains. Over the head of the Kotick nucleus will do this, if it's just in the right place.</p>
<p>Wow, that's pretty dramatic anyway.</p>
<p>One difference can totally dysfunctional, obviously so we don't want that.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>So what are what makes up an integrated enlightenment well concentration clarity equanimity?</p>
<p>Plus, wisdom you have a paradigm about how.</p>
<p>You know about emptiness suffering self. You've got a view Adarsha nod. Bawa is it to betten say there's wisdom function.</p>
<p>And then there's the ahold a mention of practice that might be called integration.</p>
<p>Up the void the degree to which emptiness your own emptiness. The emptiness of the world is healthy, empowering enlivening fulfilling and liberating for U-verse is the degree to which it's not that yet.</p>
<p>And some People have no difficulty integrating avoid some People have to work at it. Some People have to work. A lot harder at it every now and again, you get.</p>
<p>The Dark Knight, where it's actually.</p>
<p>Sort of catastrophic but still fixable but that's very labor intensive and may take a long, long time to fix that, so you have this whole spectrum of.</p>
<p>But a dimension that might be called the degree to which the emptiness or the nothingness of self and world.</p>
<p>Has been integrated it's functional? It's</p>
<p>It does good things, so concentration power sensory clarity equanimity.</p>
<p>Insight wisdom.</p>
<p>And integration of the void.</p>
<p>Might be one way to talk about dimensions.</p>
<p>Of the practice so.</p>
<p>Here's my hypothesis people with this condition.</p>
<p>Have been.</p>
<p>Bio physically.</p>
<p>Uh have bio physically induced irreversible perfect equanimity.</p>
<p>Or something like that.</p>
<p>But it actually could be a good thing.</p>
<p>The one characteristic in all cases reported is.</p>
<p>They don't complain.</p>
<p>About anything now are they actually OK, so doctors know how to do something that they call a mental status exam. You go on YouTube and learn how to do it. It's interesting. I did just for the fun of it.</p>
<p>Because there are professional and it took actually many, many decades to figure out how to teach doctors how to do this. A quick mental status exam and it's very systematic is very clever.</p>
<p>Like I say if you're interested just mental status exam on YouTube and you can get a little tutorial how to do it? Why do I mention it? Well, I'm a professional and I know how to do something called spiritual status examination just as well thought out and it's just as systematic. No one has ever done, a spiritual status examination on an 8th I'm <strong>*</strong> impatient.</p>
<p>But I'm going to see if I can pull some strings and let that happen.</p>
<p>Until then I can make a hypothesis.</p>
<p>My hypothesis is.</p>
<p>They have a physically induced profound equanimity.</p>
<p>Up.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>And they probably do not have the taste of concentration or sensory clarity.</p>
<p>'Cause that has to be cultivated.</p>
<p>And they probably do not have the insight.</p>
<p>And they may they probably have not integrated their own nothingness, so they're probably lacking those 3 elements 4 elements is my guess.</p>
<p>So the question is.</p>
<p>And I'm not pretending I know the answer to this question. But if the answer happened to be in the affirmative that could be very, very good.</p>
<p>But I don't have a clue, but I certainly know what the question is.</p>
<p>Since these are all dimensions of a single gestalt.</p>
<p>In healthy practice.</p>
<p>Will the fact that one of those dimensions seems to be on Max?</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>Would that make it easier for them to?</p>
<p>Quickly attained the other dimensions.</p>
<p>With interactive guidance because remember you can turn them on by interacting.</p>
<p>So if they were given a little bit of interactive coaching could we re engineer this.</p>
<p>From a bizarre caricature.</p>
<p>To something like the real thing.</p>
<p>Is there a potential for neuroplasticity in this condition? I have no idea?</p>
<p>But I think it's an important question.</p>
<p>Relations are static.</p>
<p>Their permanent yeah that's a G and they happen that's correct well let's see.</p>
<p>They may change size if they're depended on tumors. They it can be caused by a lot of things that's what's so amazing it could be caused by ischemic stroke. But I called the cuter in functions, but it could be caused by tumors in those locations those might change size.</p>
<p>It can also be caused by carbon monoxide poison. Apparently, the Basal Ganglia are very vulnerable to carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>
<p>Does even one case? Where was caused by a wasp sting from an anaphylactic shock?</p>
<p>Happened for whatever reason to hit right in the right place in the Basal Ganglia. So they can be caused by various things but essentially yeah that it's.</p>
<p>You know, so let us say we got lucky.</p>
<p>Let's</p>
<p>Say that</p>
<p>There's a one inch 10 chats that there's some potential for training here that significant.</p>
<p>That's just guess it might be 1 in 100.</p>
<p>OK, so.</p>
<p>If that were the case that would be interesting and good for patients for the few 100 People around the world that has this condition. We put it into an app for them and.</p>
<p>Be nice but then we have to of course, ask bigger questions.</p>
<p>Of course go bigger go home.</p>
<p>So let's say we got lucky OK. Let's say it turns out that because there in perfect equanimity. They can acquire all this other stuff in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>They'd still need an app to keep them like human OK, but the combination of that app. They afterward delivered 2 things it would keep them activated.</p>
<p>And it would train them in what they lack.</p>
<p>The paradigm the integration the concentration the clarity skills.</p>
<p>OK let's say we Get Lucky and this works well. That's great for a few 100 People that have a rare disorder.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>Then I don't give this that. Even a high probability OK. That's low probability that this is so well. Let's say we got lucky and it turns out, it is, once the next question.</p>
<p>The red pepper powder afraid what about everyone else. Well, now, we could of course through various means high intensity focused ultrasound for example, we could vision your brain and give me the app, but something tells me.</p>
<p>But this is not going to get FDA approved.</p>
<p>Yes, imagine, we want to take a healthy person and cause a horrific dysfunction that will cause their family to have to pay millions and millions of dollars to warehouse them for the rest of their lives and we would like human subjects approval to do this, yeah, well. Maybe in the 3rd right. But certainly not in the civilized world.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Uh but let me throw out a very weird sounding word.</p>
<p>And very weird sounding phrase that is not science fiction, but it actually is science is done.</p>
<p>Is known you can look it up if you want?</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>It's going to sound a little weird on a little oxy moronic.</p>
<p>All the phrases virtual lesion.</p>
<p>Now you say?</p>
<p>What the hell is a virtual lesion lesion means?</p>
<p>Destruction damage to tissue.</p>
<p>So what once averse virtual leases specifically what's a virtual lesion and someone's brain.</p>
<p>There are forms of Neural Modulation, which will temporarily down regulate or even suspend the activity of a certain region in the brain in a way that that no harm is done and the normal activity returns in a short period of time.</p>
<p>That's a virtual.</p>
<p>Up.</p>
<p>They're not very controllable at this point in terms of precision location and so forth, but</p>
<p>It is done it's done for basic science research and you can get an IRB for that. You can get an Institutional Review Board approval. That means a human subjects approval approval is done all the time.</p>
<p>I volunteer.</p>
<p>No, I've already decided which cranium is going to be the first one to go. Under the virtual scalpel. I guess which one so long, long tradition in Medison of doctors researching on themselves. Sometimes the results have been fatal out in are you going to hear that.</p>
<p>How will you know washing my thing is I probably know better because I can calibrate the dose in the location would you lose the ability to calibrate?</p>
<p>Not if they're talking me through.</p>
<p>You can activate me Oh you guys are all freaking out remember.</p>
<p>At the University where were planning on doing this will not give approval unless it is absolutely safe. I can promise you there's no University in the civilized world that is going to let anyone do anything on anyone where there's a potential for damage that is known that they so no one will allow me to do this and less.</p>
<p>Save a very, very <strong><em>*</em> </strong>* group of People have looked at it and said this is safe. This is not like you can. Just go off and do stuff OK, you have to get institutional approval and they have structures at their they are very, very conservative, as to what they let you do so don't worry. I'm not going to come back like Max headroom or something.</p>
<p>OK, so.</p>
<p>All.</p>
<p>So the next question is.</p>
<p>Can we temporarily induce it with virtual lesions?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Unfortunately.</p>
<p>Because the virtual lesions are hard to control and remember, we're talking about surgical strikes here we're talking about cubic millimeter precision.</p>
<p>So probably not.</p>
<p>Too bad but let's give it one in town. Let's be generous.</p>
<p>Well, it's number one turned out, not so one in 10 shot.</p>
<p>And #2 turned out that someone in 10 shots and I will talk about a one in a hundred shot.</p>
<p>Uhm but that would mean that we could take People.</p>
<p>Put them in this state and accelerate their practice.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>That would be good for the meditator's of the world, but like I say my.</p>
<p>Ambition is much, much bigger.</p>
<p>Looks like.</p>
<p>Everyone total it's like you do the whole thing we fix the planet or going.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Up.</p>
<p>The next thing you'd have to get very lucky.</p>
<p>Is that the medical establishment realises that this is an alternate better way to do a whole bunch of things that they are currently trying to do.</p>
<p>My treat addiction.</p>
<p>Or manage pain.</p>
<p>Or induce general anesthesia.</p>
<p>Or.</p>
<p>Cure depression.</p>
<p>Remember people in an 8th to be depressed.</p>
<p>You have to.</p>
<p>You have to have negative ideations there's no such thing as being depressed without.</p>
<p>Intense incessant negative rumination.</p>
<p>People in in and a thigh ormc state have no rumination at all.</p>
<p>They can't woman it even if they wanted to gotta ask myself.</p>
<p>If we had safe virtual Athan Hormilla.</p>
<p>And you took a depressed person.</p>
<p>Man.</p>
<p>Suspended.</p>
<p>Their depression completely.</p>
<p>For an hour a week.</p>
<p>And we're guiding them and mindfulness practice the whole time.</p>
<p>When that intervention is over would it have any effect.</p>
<p>Pronounce but it's not a ridiculous question.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Maybe you get lucky.</p>
<p>Maybe you got assured for depression.</p>
<p>Now put a monetary value on that.</p>
<p>Uh so we have to get lucky number one and we probably won't.</p>
<p>But first lucky is the condition.</p>
<p>Is actually?</p>
<p>One of the enhanced neural plasticity for acquiring the other factors. You need to be liberated.</p>
<p>Probably not, but</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Then we have to induce it safely reliably controllably.</p>
<p>Easilly noninvasively.</p>
<p>Is there a way to do that now probably not but maybe?</p>
<p>Then it would have to turn out that doing that.</p>
<p>Turns out to solve a lot of standard medical things.</p>
<p>We know for sure that people in an 8th I'm <strong>*</strong> Mick condition.</p>
<p>Report pain even in even intense pain without suffer.</p>
<p>In other words, they feel it, but it's they don't experience it as a problem.</p>
<p>I mean, I meditated for a long time, but I.</p>
<p>Cannot breathe water as easily as I breathe air. This guy did in a minute, just because he added to murder in just the right place.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Is this too?</p>
<p>Have analgesia anesthesia.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>But it's not in ridiculous question so 1st. We have to get lucky. The condition is trainable then we have to get lucky we can do sit.</p>
<p>Simply reliably safely.</p>
<p>Non invasively.</p>
<p>Our controllably that's these are all big things and neuro modulation at this point.</p>
<p>Might be able to do that.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>So let's Get Lucky #2.</p>
<p>And Get Lucky #3 it turns out that when you do this and it's not just a nice thing for People that want to meditate speeds up your practice it has.</p>
<p>One but I'm guessing if it has one, it probably has a half dozen.</p>
<p>A significant applications in standard Medison.</p>
<p>Of physical Madison in psychiatry.</p>
<p>Addiction recovery that's Get Lucky #3.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Now, how do you compute the probability of the overall success?</p>
<p>If it's contingent on let's say one in 10 chance of A.</p>
<p>One inch app ten chance of he wanted champion chance of C.</p>
<p>Once the total probability of success one in a thousand its case being 110. Gas is one of my guess is somewhere between one and 10 and one in 100 for each of these So what does that give us 100?</p>
<p>That gives us that gives us a total probability of one 100, * 100, * 1, one hundredth what's that that makes it 100.</p>
<p>If it's</p>
<p>Town it's one town times, one 10,000.</p>
<p>So one of the 1000 so somewhere between a million to one shot and 1001 shot I think is reasonable.</p>
<p>All.</p>
<p>But the payoff is still going to be in the tense of truth.</p>
<p>So the expected value is just so that's pretty exciting.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're lying number one.</p>
<p>Necessary.</p>
<p>Well, this season.</p>
<p>Well, if the if it's not trainable.</p>
<p>Um then.</p>
<p>It doesn't, it's not a situation that can be used to accelerate spiritual growth.</p>
<p>OK number one million the seating at possibly a normal brain that has a temporary deletion.</p>
<p>Virtual region, I'm going to, I'm going to guess that.</p>
<p>Because the only thing different about the person with the permanent lesions. Temporary lesions is one is permanent. There's no other difference in them.</p>
<p>So, in the most idealized case of a fan harm, yeah, subjects with the condition.</p>
<p>It seems to me that it might still be reasonable we could never number one fails.</p>
<p>To find a hopefully not shins in first subject to step up and welcome Asian Yeah. I'm guessing since with physical and psychiatric exams on the most idealized a fine warming patient show them as being completely normal. It's most likely that there's nothing else, going on there.</p>
<p>So that's a nice idea number one success. Oh no no actually now. You're on to something OK now you're on to what we're actually going to probably do I don't think I'm going to be able to get access to the 8th. I'm army of patients that's a big deal. 'cause it's too rare and you know, I don't think I'm going to be able to do that.</p>
<p>So I'm going to, I'm going to make a hypothesis that it's trainable.</p>
<p>And we're going to go right to the virtual vision, so you're absolutely correct and that you're totally.</p>
<p>On on the mark with respect to my strategies.</p>
<p>We want your brain.</p>
<p>I like you so this isn't what I intended to talk about at all. We get it on Camera Camera got the record of it here. First it still between one and 1000 and wanted a million.</p>
<p>But if we get very, very lucky.</p>
<p>This is going in the Archives said. You could also I was there with the 1000 more views than any YouTube in the history of you too because.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>So that's my thing OK go bigger go home.</p>
<p>If you ever got a Dark Knight in the brain.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Maybe someone else has but what we did you get no self and then what we did capture at Harvard was a physical cessation?</p>
<p>And one of the participants are real erode up where she was gone gone gone.</p>
<p>For a minute or 2 and we captured that in an MRI scanner. We haven't even though it's been years ago. We still have not gotten around to analyzing that part of the data takes forever to analyze this data.</p>
<p>But we did capture that but now we've never gotten a dark night well. I'm sorry. I just got carried away. I was just going to explain why I might not be answering your Phone.</p>
<p>Now I filled in the details so you can maybe have someone carious whenever we could say well. Oh yeah, yeah. I mean, you won't see that much difference. Just maybe a little latency in my response with his mad scientist trip doing what he always wanted to do.</p>
<p>Creatures control people's brains sorry about that got carried away, but I'm here your brain.</p>
<p>Deep in your practice.</p>
<p>That's what helps.</p>
<p>Informs the base in the world.</p>
<p>Deep in your own practice 'cause the more People that go deep.</p>
<p>It creates a culture where someday.</p>
<p>Some team of researchers will pull off something like this, if we can last long enough OK now company last long enough. That's a whole. Other thing I'm not going to predict you know if we're going to make it or not. But if we could somehow just hang on keep civilization going for another century or so I would say there's a high probability then.</p>
<p>Some group of People will come up with something like this and then the world will change rapidly rapidly for the better. It's the it's the old Messianic vision, but not based on mythology based on logic and evidence.</p>
<p>So anyway, so much for that.</p>
