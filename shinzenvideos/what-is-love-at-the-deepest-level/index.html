                  <h1>What is Love at the Deepest Level</h1>
                
                <p>What should we do?</p>
<p>To make this world a better place.</p>
<p>People often ask me what you know, there's this circumstance with that condition.</p>
<p>In the world.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I find myself, saying.</p>
<p>As it I can't help people with the specifics. I don't know the specifics of politics or how things should work in the world. But I do know some general principles that I think hold it in all cases.</p>
<p>And the way I sum it up is the phrase that I used at the end of the last stop, which is love deeply and act effectively now acting effectively.</p>
<p>Is uh is related to your mindfulness skills?</p>
<p>And strategies, but</p>
<p>That's not the whole picture of acting effectively acting effectively involves a lot of things, but mindfulness skills and strategies do enter rim.</p>
<p>All.</p>
<p>Loving deeply.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Critically depends on mindfulness skills and techniques so.</p>
<p>We.</p>
<p>Always are asking.</p>
<p>What is love?</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>And we're always sort of seeking something.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Is?</p>
<p>Taken me decades to have a confident answer out with regards to the question. What is love at a very deep weapon?</p>
<p>I don't think I can confidently answer it at more superficial levels that would be other kinds of experts would talk about that. But I do have a confident answer as to what it is.</p>
<p>Out a very deep level, maybe the deepest level.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>We channel is Montrae.</p>
<p>O'Malley puppy who Halo to the jewel in the Lotus.</p>
<p>So if you think of.</p>
<p>Love is this.</p>
<p>Fragrant colorful.</p>
<p>Attractive flower.</p>
<p>Is there in the center of it something?</p>
<p>That is its essence that could be called the jewel that's hidden inside that Lotus.</p>
<p>And I would say yes.</p>
<p>And I would say that I can put it into words.</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>I'm also tempted not to put it into words because the words are likely to be a let out until there is an experience that.</p>
<p>That goes with those words.</p>
<p>So the the description is.</p>
<p>Sort of.</p>
<p>Come.</p>
<p>Not all that poetic.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>How do we know that there's a world?</p>
<p>Well, we see it.</p>
<p>We hear it, we touch it.</p>
<p>And we think about it.</p>
<p>Of course when we think about it, we</p>
<p>See it here comments about it bad words about it, we have emotional.</p>
<p>Sensation so.</p>
<p>Through inner and outer activity, we have the perception that there is a world.</p>
<p>And through those same sense gates, we have the perception that we have a self.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>As you are mindfulness skills develop?</p>
<p>It becomes possible to have a more and more complete experience of inner and outer see, hear feel.</p>
<p>That means an experience with.</p>
<p>Progressively greater sensory richness, but also progressively less moment by moment fixation.</p>
<p>That leads to at paradoxical experience.</p>
<p>Which is?</p>
<p>Une experience of maximal richness.</p>
<p>Because it's getting richer and richer and richer.</p>
<p>But at the same time, minimal something nahs.</p>
<p>Because the amount of time that you're fixating any particular part of it is getting shorter and shorter and shorter.</p>
<p>So at the limit.</p>
<p>Of.</p>
<p>Add clarity and equanimity.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Is the experience that is optimally?</p>
<p>Rich.</p>
<p>And also utterly vacuous at the same time.</p>
<p>And can you put into words what that's like?</p>
<p>Short, but as I say it's likely to be a bit of a let down.</p>
<p>What it's like is?</p>
<p>That there is an absolute rest.</p>
<p>Where in</p>
<p>Time, and space collapse to a dimensionless point.</p>
<p>That has no position.</p>
<p>And then that.</p>
<p>Breaks apart.</p>
<p>And the positive spreads and the negative pull Zune.</p>
<p>There's a simultaneous expansion and contraction like a space fountain.</p>
<p>Then spreading and collapsing it's the fountain of youth.</p>
<p>Constantly, own it's gushing and gathering.</p>
<p>An it's</p>
<p>Shimmering.</p>
<p>Vibrant space.</p>
<p>And if you stay with that.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>You have everything you ever wanted.</p>
<p>And you have absolute safety you're being held by your cosmic parents.</p>
<p>Your physical parents would have been.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>A representation.</p>
<p>Of this cosmic parenting.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>But most People don't notice that even though it happens, thousands of times a day.</p>
<p>Each Sunday.</p>
<p>See the world.</p>
<p>Order themselves or</p>
<p>Here, or touch or think.</p>
<p>Or move or speak.</p>
<p>Just before.</p>
<p>This happens.</p>
<p>So People don't notice it number one and #2 it get that.</p>
<p>Scintillating missed.</p>
<p>Coagulates into inner and outer see her feel.</p>
<p>And there's a sense of.</p>
<p>And I met his vulnerable and.</p>
<p>Frost and</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Disconsolate.</p>
<p>Not getting what it wants.</p>
<p>And there is a sense of and it.</p>
<p>That is fundamentally alien and.</p>
<p>Threatening.</p>
<p>Call the world or the other.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>The jewel in the Lotus.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>When you unfold the pedals and look at what's on the inside.</p>
<p>When we say we're experiencing.</p>
<p>Human love,</p>
<p>Beard of the physical kind or any other kind.</p>
<p>But it's the human love well the human love is that is that flower.</p>
<p>And certainly that has its place.</p>
<p>In the nature of things, but it's also important to.</p>
<p>Have a deeper context where by you.</p>
<p>Understand this nonhuman love.</p>
<p>That is hidden within.</p>
<p>Always want.</p>
<p>Anne is available all the time.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>To love deeply means.</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>Before.</p>
<p>That you are aware.</p>
<p>That love always comes 1st.</p>
<p>You can't.</p>
<p>Have any reaction.</p>
<p>Of any sort whatsoever.</p>
<p>Without first having a perception.</p>
<p>Over yourself in the world except.</p>
<p>At the origin of each perception of self and world.</p>
<p>Is this this?</p>
<p>Deep love,</p>
<p>So if you come in contact with this.</p>
<p>That means that all of the decisions that judgments are the reactions, there still going to happen like they always do.</p>
<p>But there is an inescapable context.</p>
<p>That proceeds so that then colors.</p>
<p>Your response is. It doesn't mean that you no longer judge.</p>
<p>Or that you can't take action or that you can't.</p>
<p>Um confront</p>
<p>Or oppose.</p>
<p>It doesn't militate against any of that.</p>
<p>But it just puts it in a different context.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Let's say that there's something going on in the world that you think is bad.</p>
<p>And action needs to be taken to change this.</p>
<p>Certainly legitimate.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>If you're able to love deeply.</p>
<p>That's going to have a huge effect on acting effectively.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the bad news is.</p>
<p>Most humans have not yet learned how to love deeply.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Because loving deeply means hundreds of times in the day. Whenever you perceive the other the enemy. The source of the problem.</p>
<p>Then.</p>
<p>It.</p>
<p>Whenever you perceive that.</p>
<p>You first perceive.</p>
<p>That being loved into existence by the source.</p>
<p>Whether you perceive it by sight sound touch or whether you perceive it by thinking about it.</p>
<p>I mentioned the protein autonomy to literature.</p>
<p>Magistri there's the wisdom function and then there's the wisdom writings.</p>
<p>So, in the temples.</p>
<p>At least in the temple where I lived in Japan at Koyasan, there was a custom.</p>
<p>They celebrate New Years, a little differently than here, So what you do is you stay up all night like here on New Year's Eve. But you read the the entire 20,000 verses of approaching a paramita or at least as much of it as you can get through.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Uh you chanted in sino Japanese.</p>
<p>So I think I mentioned that it's.</p>
<p>It's like an Encyclopedia Britannica. It's just got all this detail of information about the world.</p>
<p>India, 2000 years ago, approximately translated into Chinese so it just.</p>
<p>List all this stuff and then it says this is outdated that's empty it's got all the.</p>
<p>You know all the cultural information.</p>
<p>Crazy ideas, they had about geography and you know, etc, etc. And then it says this is empty. This is empty this is empty.</p>
<p>And you might wonder well what's the point.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>When we won, I won New Years when we were doing that, we were chanting all night.</p>
<p>And you have to look at the book right 'cause there. We can memorize so much so you actually reading it so you're seeing what the text says.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>And I realize that.</p>
<p>What what this was all about?</p>
<p>Why we were doing that?</p>
<p>'Cause well, let's see do you know the?</p>
<p>Did you ever hear Allen Ginsberg's parody of the project a pyramid on?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I don't know if it was written down or if you just performed it.</p>
<p>But it was something to the effect of.</p>
<p><strong><em>* is empty </em></strong>*** empty. Markesan can screw is empty something along those lines, yeah, really probably find it on the Internet so.</p>
<p>Well, I just said a bunch of 4 letter words, but it when you.</p>
<p>If I say you know houses are empty apartments are empty parks are empty.</p>
<p>If you really watching image space.</p>
<p>You will see that you get what incense for this call spoke to spo.</p>
<p>TSSPHOTS program spoke up what a sapota is is a little flicker of an image.</p>
<p>That's very, very fleeting.</p>
<p>So when you're reading you know this is empty. This is empty everyone of those those, this is.</p>
<p>I started to notice created am a momentary mental image how else would I know what it means right.</p>
<p>And then I started to.</p>
<p>Tune into that and I could see the images each one of those images born in between expansion and contraction.</p>
<p>Coming from and returning to.</p>
<p>Empty.</p>
<p>So it's a whole meditation.</p>
<p>You're thinking about the world? How do you think about the world do you actually are actually aware?</p>
<p>But each one of those bursts of image and talk come from and return to the source.</p>
<p>So once you sort of realize that.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>You will be able to understand the.</p>
<p>The early 20th 21st century North American Sutra.</p>
<p>Which goes like this?</p>
<p>Trump is empty. Obama is empty trunk is empty. Obama, as empty as many times as you need to hear that.</p>
