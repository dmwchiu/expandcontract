                  <h1>GOD's ARROW ~ Shinzen tells his Experience of Enlightenment</h1>
                
                <p>It's very hard to put into words. If you get really study that's white eat the most teachers don't talk about this stuff right for very good reason. 'cause, it can be described a lot better than the books tell you, it can be described but it cannot be perfectly. This guy, so it's I mean, I could try to amplify but it's going to be explaining the Obscur.</p>
<p>With the even more obscure, yeah, I'll do it.</p>
<p>I'm going to do it anyway, I've actually doing it as we're speaking.</p>
<p>There is a word in Latin.</p>
<p>That describes it believe it or not.</p>
<p>But it is so esoteric that almost no one is ever heard this word.</p>
<p>The only reference that you will find to this word is if you look up.</p>
<p>The ecstasy of Saint Teresa.</p>
<p>Which refers to a piece of sculpture that was done in the high renaissance in the baroque period by Bernini and it's this great classic thing from you know the counter Reformation Catholic art is very dramatic so it's Saint Theresa Experiencing.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Pervasive gone but of course. How do you how do you express' that in a work of art that's going to emotionally grip People? Well, she's shown swooning.</p>
<p>And that it was hugely controversial work of Art. I mean, People were very annoyed by it and I'm talking about back in the?</p>
<p>You know back in in this the one would that have been the 1600s, I guess.</p>
<p>Because it's</p>
<p>It's very sensual OK. Let's just put it at that so anyway. What's happening is.</p>
<p>She is out and there's This Angel.</p>
<p>Sort of on her chest and he's pulling out this arrow.</p>
<p>Is not stabbing her he's actually removing the arrow?</p>
<p>And what happened before the arrow going through that's called Transverberation. It's when.</p>
<p>When the source.</p>
<p>Creates a wormhole.</p>
<p>From itself.</p>
<p>Through time space self and world and back to itself.</p>
<p>And so right now there's a wormhole sort of starts back here goes through here goes right through the center of your head and out the other way.</p>
<p>An part of me is looking through that wormhole an absolutely sees nothing. It's just void devoid. But all around that is the color for my need to interact.</p>
<p>Well, you know all I can say is that makes any sense to anyone then.</p>
<p>I salute you and I just love that word like gods, arrow that goes through the time space Continuum and of course, how wide is that Channel, well if that Channel attains a certain width.</p>
<p>You will enter Nero to some operti infused contemplation and you're out out out maybe 3 days.</p>
<p>No movement.</p>
<p>No perceptible prep a breath or etc.</p>
<p>So to follow up as a continuum, then the degree to which you are.</p>
<p>The under fixated wormhole and the degree to which there is a recognition of ISM is a moveable feast. Yeah, yes, the so that's the new that's the new paradigm gods wormhole.</p>
<p>It's called Transverberation If you're interested. We could it's just an odd word for meaning when God shoots an arrow through you.</p>
<p>So I also really enjoyed your saying what your day was what I heard. You say it's sometimes you live without source so that's that me to your book to look up the word source and there are many recommendations in your book to read about source.</p>
<p>And how do you live without source during your day the same way I did before I started to meditate?</p>
<p>'Cause it's just the experience of an ordinary person that doesn't know how to Meditate.</p>
<p>The only difference is I don't care. I have no preference between being in a deep state or just being agitated and you know bopping around taking care of business.</p>
<p>Because actually think Teresa.</p>
<p>Explained it perfectly she said.</p>
<p>It's a window it's open all the time, but</p>
<p>Well, not really sometimes it closes but you don't care because you know it's going to open again.</p>
<p>And you know that with such certainty that you don't even care.</p>
<p>The transverberation that you describe the other day that God's arrow kind of coming through with the shaft did that for you did, that happen. We did a video on YouTube about the key moments for you and you talked about the first one, where you reached around and realize you boundaries weren't there anymore did that happen like just suddenly that day or is this something that evolved overtime.</p>
<p>Took 20 years from the first breakthrough with first breakthrough was that day. So it's 20 years after that, that I started to get the transverberation slowly develop yes slowly.</p>
<p>First just a hint then more more salient.</p>
