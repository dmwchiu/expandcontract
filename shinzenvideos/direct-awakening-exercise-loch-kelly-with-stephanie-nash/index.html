                  <h1>Direct Awakening Exercise ~ LOCH KELLY with Stephanie Nash</h1>
                
                <p>Well, each exercise kind of takes you directly so let's give me a give me an example. Let's just have an example of one of these exercises. One of them one of them once we use, something physical not the thought once Alright Alright. So here's yeah, so one.</p>
<p>Simple way of getting this feeling of of shifting your awareness Outof. The identification with your mind, which creates this little self looping identity is to have awareness just.</p>
<p>Again, I'm talking to you. The awareness of talking to you. The awareness and the awake awareness. So if you think? How am I going to unhook awareness for thought I've never done that. I don't know if I can do that. And that is correct. You cannot do it, but awareness can do it. So you just have to be sometimes. I call it. The Colombo approach. It's like so by the way before I leave. I just unhook awareness and have it drop.</p>
<p>By the way this side this side. Just you know just without thinking that and then you'll be awake, so see you next so just simply have awareness, which is identified attached thought simply unhook and step back and then see what it feels like if awareness, which is the center of knowing drops and knows your Smile from within your smile.</p>
<p>Does your jaw from within your jaw?</p>
<p>Without looking up to thought and without stretching or looking down from thought.</p>
<p>Have awareness that knows directly drop into your throat.</p>
<p>Now your throat from within.</p>
<p>And then I feel awareness drop below your neck.</p>
<p>And feel your upper torso or come into your heart space.</p>
<p>And you can smile and breathe.</p>
<p>And just feel what it's like to directly perceive.</p>
<p>Your body from within without orienting.</p>
<p>To thought and without going to sleep.</p>
<p>Feel the central wrecked.</p>
<p>Awareness based embodied.</p>
<p>Open hearted non.</p>
<p>Thought based knowing.</p>
<p>Which is kind of alert?</p>
<p>So we have space to wear a lightness.</p>
<p>And it's aware of awareness.</p>
<p>Which is aware by itself?</p>
<p>Just feel that relief.</p>
<p>And notice this new non conceptual.</p>
<p>Embodied.</p>
<p>Way out.</p>
<p>Shifting into another dimension.</p>
<p>Of your consciousness.</p>
<p>See what's absent.</p>
<p>It was there and then see the qualities of presents.</p>
<p>Let's start to cut up.</p>
<p>Shimmer.</p>
<p>What do you notice?</p>
<p>Um would love in what one thing I love about that is not checking up you see looking up, you're not looking. I'm not looking up an I'm not looking down here going outlook. That's happening there. I'm not. This witness watching this which is in your neck structure. Do alot like I feel my knee and now I'm from labeling here, but you literally talk about.</p>
<p>Being there and for me that's like.</p>
<p>See here not much nice it's full is nice. It's warm. It's there's love along and the not looking up, looking down is free 'cause you realize it's kind of like The Wizard of Oz is behind there trying to move all the gears to make that thing work and it's like he's not there anymore, so you can just allow it to be something.</p>
<p>Without all the well, you know stuff there and that's nice and then just take us out. Check this out. Interesting Lee is a bunch of different ways kind of like Utah. I'm like you.</p>
<p>Aware of different learning types, so some People are kinesthetic. Some People are emotional. Some People are more mental some people with visual. Some People have auditory so I use different doors for some People will like Oh that one was really good and that one didn't work, so well, but by the time we do short little. Everyone thinks something so I'm starting to happen and they get to the same place and then interesting they use their own words.</p>
<p>Even describe it and they don't need to use the vocabulary that I'm starting with that's the style of his teaching. Hill kind of guide you to an experience and then literally rather than talking about it has everyone go around the room and report their words and what's nice always about that is one is a student you get to hear? What everyone else is doing. Not that I'll have some of that he is. It helps open your idea to other things that can be or maybe it was worth you hadn't thought to describe it.</p>
<p>Your own experience is the teacher sitting there, I was going where they go puffcorn happening in this room and throughout the workshop. You hear someone to be aware of where this, what you hear them at the beginning and at the end. There were a couple People at the end going.</p>
<p>Oh, and you get these are has and you know as a teacher. I guess you know high fiving him and going out is so cool 'cause. That's teacher. The Moody tell you get this joy at that because you know they walked out the door with something that's kind of shift their life in a good way, and not giving them tools to be able to do it themselves, yeah, so there's like these short practices and I've written this book about it.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, you <strong><em>*</em></strong> forgot there's a quick you wanna you wanna put something on this? What's your book shift in the freedom. The science and practice of Openhearted Awareness. Alright got that shift into freedom and then currently there's an audio and it's a very perfect title for what this is too. It is exactly a shift in defeat and there's an audience in the audio currently is the audio of the practice is not.</p>
<p>The audio of the book you wanna sleep there for 12 hours. I end up doing it. That and that will come out, but I always like to hear the teacher like I want to hear Pema Chodron read her book. I want to hear the word. I don't want the actor. They hired that's where I want to hear you describe it. Could you also get that kind of the energy of how it comes in so when you say it's the audio just practice the audio of the practice is kind of the teaching style is?</p>
<p>You know like the teacher. It's right. I'm introducing the students to their own inner teacher. You know, and when I'm.</p>
<p>Showing or pointing them to look within its not. Look up here, but look back within you and then once you discover this non conceptual awareness by being able to speak from there. It's really not even about the words. It's about speaking from non conceptual heart mind so that you start to rewire functioning and living from this new way of knowing.</p>
<p>And being so that you can start to make it a normal thing and then the middle of your life. You can start to just walk down the street go to work have relationships hang out, have fun.</p>
<p>From a continuous awakening losing it and part of the small glimpses. Of course, initially you're going to recognize realize an lose it and then the practices re recognize so training to re recognize and return and remain an then speak and walk and talk. From there and then lose it and then no big surprise just re recognize and then again, and the training.</p>
<p>Can be done with these small glimpses in the midst of your day?</p>
