                  <h1>HEBREW PRAYER a la SHINZEN YOUNG</h1>
                
                <p>So, sometimes during the map Top I'd like to do a chant.</p>
<p>And this is the chip that I do so. I wanted to explain what it means like I say yeah. I'm not sure whether I do it or not. It's sort of like spur of the moment. But if you ever. Hear me do this chat. I want to make sure everybody understands that it's spiritual not political statement.</p>
<p>This is one of the main Hebrew prayers that my rabbi mistake say all the time that's why I internalized it. When I was a little boy. But I like it because it can be it can be given a really deep interpretation.</p>
<p>Excuse me while I wet my whistle.</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>It was just lighter to carry over can People see it if not I guess you'll have to.</p>
<p>Well, this particular thing was you eat Hebrew may not be all that relevant.</p>
<p>You know if you sort of Squint Your eyes, a little bit, it looks like Tibetan.</p>
<p>That's not a coincidence Can you believe that that is not a coincidence to Benton is derived from Devanagari script of India Devanagari script of India is derived from the Aramaic script.</p>
<p>Which has its origin in? What is not called lemon on?</p>
<p>And so does HEB.</p>
<p>And so does Greek and therefore Latin and therefore our alphabet also.</p>
<p>Alphabet was only invented once it's one of the most extraordinary cases of cultural diffusion known.</p>
<p>1000 years ago, some very clever people in what is not Lebanon on?</p>
<p>Figured out the concept of alphabet.</p>
<p>And be it spread by diffusion all the way to Japan and Indonesia.</p>
<p>And all the way to England just went around the whole eastern.</p>
<p>Atmosphere basically there they all go back to one source. That's why alphabet from Alpha Beta Gamma Delta in Greek. Olive bet Gimel Dalad into coincidence anyway. This is Hebrew letters.</p>
<p>And it says.</p>
<p>I hope I didn't screw it up, I did it from memory.</p>
<p>Also, Shalom being Roma, who yeah asset, shallow, a little they are curious rail we move on me so.</p>
<p>This has this word.</p>
<p>Shin La Mad Men.</p>
<p>This is a really, really interesting.</p>
<p>Ha ha.</p>
<p>3 syllables?</p>
<p>The Arabic pronunciation is Salaam Hebrew pronunciation is shot home usually understood as peace, but it means a lot more a lot more. I'm not going to do it now, but in the past. I've given the entire talk about how the entire path can be described in terms of permutations of these 3 letters.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Essentia Lee, It's not just piece. It's peace that comes through completeness chalen means complete as an adjective.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>When you</p>
<p>You've</p>
<p>Have a complete experience of something OK, when you are complete with it. Where does that lead to it leads to the absolute piece of 0, so the process of completing.</p>
<p>Leads to this peace and Furthermore, it has a connotation of safety and well being.</p>
<p>It's also that there that's the Afro Asiatic languages of which HEB is one and so is Arabic and so is HE Gyptian. They they have a very different structure. There's 3 consonants and then the vowels and other consonants are permuted around that or positioned around that to create words and.</p>
<p>More medical forms so.</p>
<p>Just the Shimla Madman, there shall come alone and then you could put vowels in different places that you can make Shalom you can make Islam Moose, Lim and so forth so anyway. This is the special kind of peace. It comes about in my way of thinking through.</p>
<p>Doing the activity of whatever it is and sure enough.</p>
<p>I will say this means doing OK, so may may he or it.</p>
<p>Who creates absolute peace? Who is really actually this is a present participle made the one who is creating the piece of Heaven.</p>
<p>Bring peace to you.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>They are cold yesterday, yeah that's the part of my to talk about and upon all of Israel's so in mockery of understanding, which is my the way I choose to understand Israel doesn't refer to a tribe or a nation, I'd like to think of it.</p>
<p>As the song gun, the community who struggles for spirituality because actually it's wrong.</p>
<p>If you remember the story of Jacob's ladder etc. So you sort of means is from a root. That means to struggle. So I interpret this as meaning to struggle to get to God OK, so it has no political or ethnic connotations for me whatsoever within.</p>
<p>This statement 'cause I cannot imagine any kind of blessing that is limited to one nation or one ethno's.</p>
<p>So I just want to make that clear. I'll call you, Sir I'll very imru an say.</p>
<p>That should be over there.</p>
<p>Amen, which you know from English armband, so be, it something like that, so if you ever. Hear me sing. This during the meta you'll know what it refers to as a lot of deep meaning.</p>
<p>Up.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>So just wanted to mention that.</p>
