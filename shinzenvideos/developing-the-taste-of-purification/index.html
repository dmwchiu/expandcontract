                  <h1>Developing the 'Taste of Purification'</h1>
                
                <p>We talk a lot about purification.</p>
<p>On this path and especially I hear you talk about it is one of the.</p>
<p>Benefits or events that happen with this practice, but I'll speak to my own experience, but purification isn't always pretty and sometimes you have be blindsided with lots of.</p>
<p>Emotion or disconcerting internal Top or you know could you just speak to this process of working with purification and or how it can arise?</p>
<p>What are the different forms of purification that we could experience and in terms of working with that as its own phenomenon?</p>
<p>Sometimes People confuse the purification might think that's a new problem.</p>
<p>When one practices.</p>
<p>As time goes on one develops kind of sensitivity.</p>
<p>To something that I call purification.</p>
<p>In fact, I would say that one of the major watersheds in a person's practice.</p>
<p>Is when they start to develop the taste of purification or they can actually sense that purification is happen So what do we mean by purification?</p>
<p>It's a perception that.</p>
<p>Because of the way that I'm experiencing this moment.</p>
<p>With high concentration sensory clarity an especially equanimity.</p>
<p>Because of the way I'm experiencing this moment.</p>
<p>Things that have been getting in the way from the past.</p>
<p>Are getting worked through?</p>
<p>And you actually sense that that is happening.</p>
<p>Now, how do you sense that that's hard to put into words?</p>
<p>You just develop it's like wine tasting wine tasters can detect all sorts of subtleties in flavor bouquet finish you know tannens what have you.</p>
<p>They just develop the pallet to detect stuff that the average person doesn't detect.</p>
<p>At some point every meditator who stays with the process.</p>
<p>Develops this sense that because of how I'm experiencing the present the past, is being worked through.</p>
<p>Like I say I can't put into words how you know it's happening. But you just do you also know that because of that every moment in the future is going to be better for you?</p>
<p>So that's a huge watershed in practice because before that happens.</p>
<p>Your preoccupation with regards to meditation is to have certain experiences while you meditate you want to be concentrated. You want to be calm. You want to have altered states you want to have whatever you want to have feel good have something interesting and entertaining or unusual happen.</p>
<p>When People start their practice. That's how they evaluate their practices like you know something good or interesting or unusual happened so that was a good meditation at some point if you stay with it, you develop this sensitivity for the purification.</p>
<p>And then</p>
<p>Your motivation shift you're not interested in getting to any particular state you're interested in setting the stage for nature to optimize purification.</p>
<p>You said to set the stage and let time pass and the purification is taking place, and you can taste it.</p>
<p>And because you can taste it, you don't mind if you're in a lot of pain in your body you don't mind if there's a lot of emotions in your body you don't mind if there's a lot of confusion in your mind because, although under by ordinary ways of thinking painted the body uncomfortable emotions at the body confusion in the mind. That's like the last thing in the world. Anybody would ever want. But if you can taste the purification while that's going on.</p>
<p>So you know the past, is getting worked through and the future every moment of the future will be better for me because of how I'm experiencing this present moment uncomfortable, though it is, once that taste of purification kicks in. Then you start to grow exponentially the rate of growth.</p>
<p>Takes off in a hockey stick mode.</p>
<p>When you kiss those way you think taste of purification. That's making it sound like on developing a taste. You know when someone is drinking wine. They know they're drinking wine, but no, the interpretation of if that is purification. If it isn't purification and or my relationship to that is that you said. Oh, I don't mind if I'm in pain. I don't mind do you say develop a taste you mean where that starts to become a pleasant experience?</p>
<p>I would say that whenever a person in the present moment.</p>
<p>Brings a quality of concentration clarity and equanimity to their experience or even one or two of those.</p>
<p>At any level whatsoever.</p>
<p>Purification is happening whether they're aware of it or not.</p>
<p>Whether they are aware of it or not, it is happened.</p>
<p>But after long practice you know it's happening.</p>
<p>But I cannot describe to you how you know it's another dimension of experience you sense it. You knowing help the process. The knowing is what makes the process snowball. That's what gives the exponential growth because the fact. In other words, you're getting a reward. I wouldn't exactly, say the reward is pleasure. It's another kind of reward, although you will typically react with pleasure when you taste purification.</p>
<p>The taste itself is not the taste of pleasure. It's its own dimension. It's just one of those things you have to experience by practicing but once that happens, then no matter how horrific and experience maybe.</p>
<p>You're getting rewarded in that experience, not necessarily rewarded by pleasure, but rewarded by this something else. This taste of purification so that more you taste it. The more you're willing to have equanimity the more you're willing to have equanimity the more you tasted that's called a positive feedback loop and your practice just goes off on a hockey stick curve before that, it tends to be linear and rather.</p>
<p>Subtle once the taste of purification develops you got this positive feedback loop and it just goes and that's that's how you make that journey of 1,000,000 miles in just a few years, you only walked 110 miles in the first year but what you don't realize is the longer you walk the faster you walk and the taste of verification is the main thing that makes that happen.</p>
