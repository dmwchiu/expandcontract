                  <h1>EARTHQUAKE</h1>
                
                <p>Now that sounds like the wealth of the earth, meaning that it could could become.</p>
<p>A major turning point in the history of our species were having an earthquake.</p>
<p>Is that what that is yeah?</p>
<p>I'm waiting for.</p>
<p>Well, I hope you were disappointed that ain't much of an earthquake.</p>
<p>Just just some entertainement up here in Palace birdies just for you all for tonight. Thank you they seem to happen. On Friday nights like this second one in about 2 months on Friday night just about this time.</p>
<p>Oh no that's great we were enjoying it.</p>
<p>Joe is having a complete experience. What can I say we can do a lot better than that? Yeah, we don't get them on these coast very much true.</p>
<p>The The Earthquake. Yes, what to do when the earthquake comes well. But there's a semco on anyone care to answer what to do when the earthquake comes.</p>
<p>Well, that's the explanation or the manifestation.</p>
<p>My explanation would be you can't shake the shaking.</p>
<p>Um impermanence.</p>
<p>Complete experience.</p>
<p>Actually does feel like an earthquake.</p>
<p>That earthquake was on queue for me at least are going to interpret it that way. I was just about to say that when you have a complete if experience. It feels like an earthquake it shakes heaven and earth because it is the.</p>
<p>The authentic person without a fixed position, I wasn't going to relate it to an earthquake OK just but it is a reasonable comparison, and one in fact that I have made numerous times in the past.</p>
<p>So one of the.</p>
<p>Times when I knew that this practice was really doing something industrial strength.</p>
<p>For me was when we have the center. Some of you were around back that far on Elden Ave remember in Korea town.</p>
<p>So 1 morning I.</p>
<p>I had to go in to do something that I'd forgotten and so I had gotten in my car and then so I forgot to do that and I ran into the center.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>And I left the keys in the car is downtown right.</p>
<p>And sure enough like.</p>
<p>2 minutes later, I came out.</p>
<p>The cars gone.</p>
<p>And what was that experience.</p>
<p>I'm remembering it because at the time.</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>Just like an earthquake.</p>
<p>That's all there was no thought there was no emotion.</p>
<p>As an object it was so complete that it was just.</p>
<p>Space rocking.</p>
<p>It was just like that last penultimate scene in the first matrix.</p>
<p>When?</p>
<p>Puts the name of the character, but yeah.</p>
<p>Neo Neo.</p>
<p>Neil realises who he is right, and the whole frame of the movie Sorta goes a wall.</p>
<p>I mean that's really what it was like it wasn't just my my mind, and my body was the sight and sound. Everything the whole frame of the self in scene was just this wave.</p>
<p>And then</p>
<p>It was just like being massage.</p>
<p>And then I just went in called the cops and left with that was that you know reported it.</p>
<p>That was dramatic.</p>
<p>That was a complete experience of having your car swiped.</p>
<p>In downtown away.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p><strong><em>* </em></strong>**** it took it were so stupid. They put their graffiti in it. The cops busted him eventually got the car back left the graffiti just for the cultural.</p>
