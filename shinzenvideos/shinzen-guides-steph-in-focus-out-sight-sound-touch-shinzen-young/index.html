                  <h1>Shinzen Guides Steph in 'Focus Out' (Sight, Sound, Touch)~ Shinzen Young</h1>
                
                <p>The focusing out sounds interesting, so does the positive but I think the focusing out sounds very interesting OK good so you'll remember I said that we would very carefully define terms so.</p>
<p>External sounds right will call sound.</p>
<p>External sites will call site.</p>
<p>And then physical sensations in your body will call touch.</p>
<p>So I'm going to describe a technique Ann. I want you to tell me if it makes sense.</p>
<p>If all you're aware of is touch. I'd like you to say out loud touch and focus on that for a second will call that noting.</p>
<p>If all you're aware of is touch, not touch if all you're aware of his sight, not site. If all you're aware of his sound old sound if more than one is available just choose one to note. It doesn't matter which intently focus on that for a few seconds and then.</p>
<p>Note again, either the same thing or something else does that make sense are mine. I suppose to be open. They will be in a minute, but I will because we're gonna site, you mean with external site that's right. But I wanted you to prepare with your eyes closed just to get settled. So let me just repeat when I focus on touch. I'm focusing on body sensations, like sitting in the chair or.</p>
<p>Close or just just at any sensation that's not emotional and that's touch sight would be what I see with my eyes open and sound is now what's going to pull you away from touch sight sound? Is your reactions to it, which is feel image talk.</p>
<p>$0.70 or my thoughts well. Yes, you're feeling it stock could take the form of reaction to touch sight sound or it could go off on its own and spin memory plan in fantasy.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>In your be constantly pulled towards feel image talk when that happens just let go of that and focus on touch side sound so it's sort of expansive concentration.</p>
<p>You know the contractive world of thought and emotion pulls in and you work against that expanding out into touch sight sound.</p>
<p>That makes sense. I expanding out you mean I'm moving your windows aware of like the outside world. Yes, letting go of the inside world. This will right so you like anchoring yourself in the power of now.</p>
<p>OK, OK, the touches the sights and the sounds are always now, so that will weaken the gripping power of fantasy memory planning and judge mental illness.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>We're going to start to make it simple I'm going to have you just do touch and sound for a second and then we'll add site alright, so I'd like you to say those labels out loud.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Just when my awareness is on it that's correct OK.</p>
<p>Touch.</p>
<p>Touch.</p>
<p>Sound.</p>
<p>Sound.</p>
<p>Touch.</p>
<p>Touch lots perfect, meaning the tone of voice the pacing and the words the wording. That's exactly how to have both at the same time, but you're taking your selectively trying to pour your attention on just one that's the dividing conquer.</p>
<p>One thing at a time kind of thing K cut now we're going to up the ante. Open your eyes.</p>
<p>And include site is there a particular let your eyes. Just do whatever they want to do OK and now you're going to have 3 possible things OK well site is big. So so I'm just adding sites at that butt touches and sells Maple you also.</p>
<p>Site.</p>
<p>Site.</p>
<p>Touch.</p>
<p>Sound.</p>
<p>Site.</p>
<p>Site.</p>
<p>Sound that's perfect now instead of saying the words out loud.</p>
<p>Do it mentale.</p>
<p>So you just gonna think the labels touch side sound.</p>
<p>Able to do that pretty good, yeah.</p>
<p>Takes all there's not room to do anything else, it takes over your concentration just to do it.</p>
<p>So I think you could see potentially this would pull you out of obsessive thoughts. You can also see that you could do this in motion while you could be moving house work even when you get good at talking to People and you could still I'm doing it now as I'm talking to you and then you can think of what to say, well. Why don't we didn't get into it but it remember I said base level of concentration clarity?</p>
<p>Eventually it just goes on autopilot on doing it now without having to make the even the mental labels. But I'm aware is it touch sight sound that I'm focusing on trying to do it. Yeah, yeah, so that allows you and I think you can see it built you feel like you're more focus right? That's the concentration using my whole sense of being here. I realize how much my sense of who I am is really you know, Oh that voice in my head is telling me where to go and you're going to be late or you know.</p>
<p>It's all in here and kind of focused here and there's something about this that makes my whole sense of what I am bigger. You know as my awareness moves out there and like I said it doesn't leave room for my.</p>
<p>Chatter my incessant chatter in my head it like takes a break. I I'm not aware of it until afterwards and obviously it's activated now again as I talk but.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's the general idea thank you.</p>
