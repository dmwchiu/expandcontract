                  <h1>Five Aspects of the Five Ways - 3 of 4</h1>
                
                <p>One of the</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Main discoveries of the historical buta.</p>
<p>Was this notion that?</p>
<p>You could.</p>
<p>Take the phenomenon of limited suffering self and analyze it into its components.</p>
<p>And as the result of that.</p>
<p>Your identification with the limited suffering self would be broken and the sense that.</p>
<p>There ever even was a limiting suffering self.</p>
<p>Evaporates.</p>
<p>In early Buddhism.</p>
<p>There were a number of ways of sort of chopping up the pod.</p>
<p>The 5:00</p>
<p>Aggregates of clinging if we were to put into more contemporary vocabulary would probably be something like the 5 things People tend to identify with.</p>
<p>So what do we identify with route but the physical but they do not you can interpret the Poly word fadanuf broader neroli?</p>
<p>You can interpret it as applying to any and all sensory experience just body or just body sensation but I would say.</p>
<p>However, you interpret it the thing that really gets us.</p>
<p>Are the are the emotional pleasures and pains?</p>
<p>It's it's hard, but you can learn to accept.</p>
<p>Physical pain in the body.</p>
<p>People learn to do this, but how many People can have on a rising of.</p>
<p>Terror or grief or rage in their body and.</p>
<p>It's just.</p>
<p>Narrow it just doesn't get them OK.</p>
<p>That's really, really hard, even though it's just body sensation they're much harder to.</p>
<p>Have a complete experience up why because?</p>
<p>But I call feel all know my definition of field body sensation. That seems to a given individual at a given time to be emotionally nature.</p>
<p>Those are sensations that have been honed by the evolutionary process to be an internal reward and punishment system.</p>
<p>To control us robotically?</p>
<p>So it's really, really hard to have a complete experience of field but it's well worth.</p>
<p>OK, so rupa veda not.</p>
<p>Sonya Sonya means concept.</p>
<p>Means thinking.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>Concept is very conceptual, I like to.</p>
<p>Deal with thinking in terms that it's a sensor event image talk now. You might say but what about the unconscious.</p>
<p>Well, when you develop a sensitivity to wear images arise. Most of you had this experience at some point. The surface images don't arise. But you're aware there's some activity down there a lot of activity that's subconscious visual thinking.</p>
<p>You develop a sensitivity to where you can hear internal talk at some point you don't hear the words anymore. But there is a rumbling of 1000 voices down there. That's subconscious auditory thinking, so you can directly experience and monitor the subconscious by using the categories image space and taught space even if there's no explicit image activity or talk activity.</p>
<p>So that's at least.</p>
<p>One level of the subconscious.</p>
<p>Then there's this thing called?</p>
<p>Some scara in Sanskrit or some Cara Pauley.</p>
<p>It's a plural actually some car's.</p>
<p>That's the.</p>
<p>That's the deep unconscious.</p>
<p>Mind.</p>
<p>Where the habit patterns are stored?</p>
<p>One way to get that in contact with that those very deep.</p>
<p>Levels that you can't directly observe their below. Even the subtle feel image talk. There, like way way down. There is sort of look at your sub personalities or you look at your habitual modes.</p>
<p>I mean?</p>
<p>You know, I've got certain certain grooves that I just fall into right there's like there's like there's the OK, let's.</p>
<p>Entertain ourselves with mathematic group mathematics, groove, OK that's one of my groups is OK. Let's run a sexual fantasy group that's another one. I don't wanna do. The other then then then there's uh OK. I gotta do some writing because I'm meditation teacher and I gotta do. That's like another group got to work with students group like all People see how their practices going.</p>
<p>That's a lot easier than sit down and write texts and articles and that's a hard group OK. It's like somebody calls and there in crisis and they got 3 hours. That's great totally hot for it. 'cause I know what the probable results are and doesn't really take that much effort on my part is an algorithm. I see the whole chess game in front of me 12 moves ahead for years and years and years.</p>
<p>Practice.</p>
<p>So when some personalities are these like major sort of habit patterns come up, I can sense this.</p>
<p>This cone that's going down deep deep deep into my subconscious.</p>
<p>It broadens as it goes down and it's accessing all that previous conditioning and the tip of it is coming up as this sensory event of his pattern.</p>
<p>So it's</p>
<p>Just space simultaneously expanding and contracting.</p>
<p>If I could experience it that way, then I could break the identification.</p>
<p>Then there's Viciana, Oregon Yana in Poly that means consciousness.</p>
<p>I don't know what consciousness is by and traditional Buddhism. It comes in 6 flavors hearing seeing smelling tasting and body sensation.</p>
<p>In my system it's touch that sound healing. Massage me like socialize islands piece point quiet. Those are the flavors. I don't know what consciousness is but it comes in those flavors.</p>
<p>But we can also consider it.</p>
<p>In its</p>
<p>Vanilla form with independent of flavor.</p>
<p>When we consider independent of flavor, then we call it consciousness.</p>
<p>In the traditional Buddhist Formulation.</p>
<p>Consciousness is no more spiritual than your material body.</p>
<p>It's spiritual is 0.</p>
<p>The material body is called Rupa and the other four aggregates are.</p>
<p>Are collectively called namah?</p>
<p>Nirvana is explicitly defined as beyond Namor Lupa.</p>
<p>That's where I was thinking of that story, there's a monk who.</p>
<p>It's pretty enlightened gone pretty far.</p>
<p>And he</p>
<p>Is having a conversation with his master and it gets late into the night?</p>
<p>And so it's time to go back to his room and so of course. They didn't have flashlights in those days. He's he's this candle and steps out of the room. I remember he's pretty enlightened. But he's not quite there yet, and it's the job of the Rose, she too.</p>
<p>Point him to what's the next step.</p>
<p>OK steps out of the room in the Minetti steps out of the room, the Rose, she goes.</p>
<p>Close out the Camera.</p>
<p>And there's nothing but darkness.</p>
<p>That's the last little holding on to identification with consciousness itself.</p>
<p>Gotta let the light go out.</p>
<p>Definitely do not Rage Against the fading of the light let it happen don't worry, it'll come right back.</p>
