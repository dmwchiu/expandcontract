                <p>So there are many, many facets to the experience of flow. I use the use the word flow for any kind of change other than the abrupt vanishings have you worked with the experience of something vanishing as a special case of change that has a special significance because each time you notice something vanish for just a fraction of a second your attention is.</p>
<p>Adverted turned towards.</p>
<p>A place that's outside of place an outside of time.</p>
<p>That instant of banishing turns you just instantaneously towards the unborn source. The place where a disappears. Too is exactly the place that gives birth to be in the next.</p>
<p>Instead of experience so when I have you work with the theme of change or impermanence. You note vanishings and then all other kinds of change anything?</p>
<p>I just use the word flow just have a nice name for it.</p>
<p>So how can things flow?</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>It's nothing Mystical Mystical, something can get more intense or it can get less intense.</p>
<p>If you ever notice something get more intense or less intense. You experience flow, as I've described a sensation could spread or it could collapse.</p>
<p>Something could speed up your thoughts or a certain sensation someplace it's frequency could speed up.</p>
<p>Or could slow down there could be inward pressures outward pressures.</p>
<p>Even the scattering of your awareness, which is usually looked upon as a problem like I'm all over the place that could simply be looked upon as a kind of expensive flow.</p>
<p>And the gripping and holding the obsessing the not being able to let go of something or something.</p>
<p>Holding you so you can't get free from it. That certainly could be interpreted as a problem or it could be interpreted as simply a form of contractive flow and in that sense, not a problem.</p>
<p>So as you're paying attention to the kinds of ordinary experiences that I just mentioned things get more intense lesson 10 speed up slow down spread collapse. There's inward pressure force outward pressure force.</p>
<p>Scattering gripping as you're paying attention to that.</p>
<p>You could notice that.</p>
<p>All of the things that I've mentioned.</p>
<p>Involve an interplay of contrasts.</p>
<p>There's like OK could push out it can push in it can get more intensely can get less intense. So if we were to abstract from this situation we could say that.</p>
<p>There's 2 basic principles underlying flow.</p>
<p>A principle love increase a principle of decrease and there's many, many flavors and dimensions within which the increase, and decrease can express itself.</p>
<p>And so we can give a general term to the principle of increase we could call it expansion if you wish.</p>
<p>And then we can give a general term to the principle of decrease we can call it contraction.</p>
<p>In between increase and decrease.</p>
<p>Is a balance point that we could call 0 if we were using an additive metaphor?</p>
<p>With regards to all of the different flavors that I mentioned.</p>
<p>As you're paying attention to things speeding up slowing down getting more intense less intense, pushing out pulling in scattering gripping.</p>
<p>You might get a sense that accompanying.</p>
<p>Each one of these flavors of expansion and contraction.</p>
<p>Is a sense that space itself? Is expanding the space of the experience is expanding or contracting?</p>
<p>If as you're practicing that theme should come up.</p>
<p>You pay attention to expansion contraction. It has many, many guises some of them not all that pleasant.</p>
<p>But you might notice that there's always an increase in space. Actually, it's an increase in time. Space time space gets inflated when things intends to get inflated when things intensify when they speed up when there's outward pressure, etc, etc. Then space or time space tends to collapse, so you could tune into the.</p>
<p>Space Nahs.</p>
<p>Associated with the flow of expensive and contractive flavors and to the extent that you would tune into the space. Nousu are tuning tuning into the spacious nature of consciousness. This is a phrase that's used very much in the Zope champ tradition of Tibetan practice. They talk about spaciousness.</p>
<p>Spaciousness is maybe not the best English word because it implies a pre existing solidified.</p>
<p>Stage called space that somehow you're supposed to get in contact with. But I'm sure that that's not what that tradition is aiming at when they say spaciousness because that's just a solidified perception.</p>
<p>Spaciousness is the.</p>
<p>Ah, the space nature of experience when you have a complete experience.</p>
<p>It's utterly rich, but utterly transparent, and so presents itself as space itself.</p>
<p>Sasaki row sheet says you must reach the point in your practice where when you laugh space is laughing. And when you cry space is crying and it's very enigmatic. You can't guess what? Was he talking about, but then.</p>
<p>In a few months or a few years or a few decades. You have this experience. Oh yeah of course, that would be the way to describe this so if you can.</p>
<p>Fight long enough against Spaciness.</p>
<p>The reward, you get is quote spaciousness, which is really space Nahs.</p>
<p>It may seem bleak, but it's the rich incorporates the richness of everything within it.</p>
