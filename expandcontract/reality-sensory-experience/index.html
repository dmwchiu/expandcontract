                  <h1>Reality & Sensory Experience</h1>
                
                <p>I usually don't talk about reality. I prefer to talk about sensory experience.</p>
<p>Sensory experience is something I have a lot of confidence.</p>
<p>Uh with when I make statements about sensory experience. It's based on years and years of my own investigations working with my own sensory experience other People sensory experience.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>As I say have a lot of confidence in that I don't speak about the underlying reality. That's behind sensory experience or even if there is a reality behind sensory experience or?</p>
<p>What is it People will often ask well you know what? Do we really see what do we really here?</p>
<p>The reason I don't talk about it is that I don't have confidence that I have good answers about it. I have my own conjectures, but they're just that.</p>
<p>When it comes to sensory experience, I know I can teach People things that are true deep useful and broad now in general things that are true deep useful and broad are considered good science, so I think I can give good science for sensory experience.</p>
<p>In terms of what's behind sensory experience or what's really out there.</p>
<p>I notice that very intelligent People.</p>
<p>Seemed to be arguing about this.</p>
<p>For a very, very long time.</p>
<p>Intelligent People that have given a lot of thought and research, to the question of what is object if X Ternal Reality?</p>
<p>That is to say scientists and philosophers. People who specialize in this field do not seem to be able to agree.</p>
<p>And have not been able to agree for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>That indicates to me that, although someday, the question probably will be answered in a satisfactory way for humanity.</p>
<p>At this point in human history, it still contentious and conjectural and therefore not something that I as an amateur would want to make any statements about so I limit myself to what I know for sure.</p>
<p>I know for sure that our sense of perceiving self arises through feel image talk reactions to touch sight sound. I know for sure that suffering equals paid multiplied by resistance, etc, etc. And for me these.</p>
<p>Awareness is of sensory experience are enormously liberating I know for sure that when you bring enough concentration clarity and equanimity to any ordinary sensory experience that ordinary sensory experience becomes so utterly extraordinary that it could be named spiritual to be this is important stuff and I have absolute confidence in it.</p>
<p>If you ask me well, what's the object of reality reflected in touch sight sound feel image dog. The sensory experiences. We have so I say I don't know.</p>
<p>Could I make a wild conjecture sure, but it would be a wild conjecture, not something that I would speak with a lot of confidence and certainly not something that I would try to convince any other human being up.</p>
<p>If I were to make a wild conjecture as to what's really out there.</p>
<p>I would guess that.</p>
<p>Every touch sight sound feel image talk experience that we have is actually an experience of.</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>Everything all together in a way.</p>
<p>That the human brain is not.</p>
<p>Conditioned.</p>
<p>Evolved to perceive.</p>
<p>So we can't imagine what everything at once is the whole causal Nexus the Suchness.</p>
<p>Our brains aren't designed to process that.</p>
<p>That would be my guess.</p>
<p>For what it's worth.</p>
