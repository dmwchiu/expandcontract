                  <h1>The True Beauty of Your 'Soul'</h1>
                
                <p>I will sometimes use the words soul.</p>
<p>When I do.</p>
<p>I am referring to.</p>
<p>Essentia Lee ones subjective world.</p>
<p>The world of feel image and talk.</p>
<p>Considered in terms of its?</p>
<p>Deepest layers.</p>
<p>In other words.</p>
<p>When you</p>
<p>Work with your subjective experience of practice that I call focus in.</p>
<p>You can track the surface of your subjective experience in terms of explicit mental pictures, which tend to center in front of or behind your eyes internal talk, which tends to center in your ears.</p>
<p>Or in your head somewhere, maybe symmetrical, maybe asymmetrical and then emotional type body sensations. So the emotional type body sensations. If their present. I say that they feel is active so you have feel image talk. So you can track your subjective world of thought. Emotion reaction desire and so forth will in terms of on the surface.</p>
<p>Feel image talk.</p>
<p>As the surface feel image talk sort of plays itself out you become aware that underneath.</p>
<p>That explicit feel image talk are subtler and subtler and subtler levels of.</p>
<p>Similar stuff but it's finer and more widespread.</p>
<p>So there's</p>
<p>Layers of subtle image activity underneath the surface image activity. Likewise, with talk likewise with feel. In fact, even when there doesn't seem to be any explicit talk going on, you can sort of hear rumbling in subtle activity and talk space.</p>
<p>Same with sort of like snow on your mental screen a rumbling deep down an image space.</p>
<p>And in your emotional centers in your body it's like the circuits. There are idling like the wheels are turning but.</p>
<p>The clutch is not engaged so you're not emotionally going anywhere, so there are these subtle levels of Association and processing that are fine, but broad.</p>
<p>I will sometimes loosely in a sort of colloquial way refer to those more subtle deep levels of feel image talk activity as soul.</p>
<p>For example, when you get a sense that material is being released that the blockages within the depths of fit space are working their way out. I'll sometimes poetically say that the thorns are being sort of plucked out of your soul or the lumps in your soul or being worked through here. I'm just using soul poetically not in any.</p>
<p>Theological or well defined, psychological sense to refer to the deeper more subliminal levels of feel image talk activity. One of the reasons that it's so challenging to untangle the field image dot is that it's not a one scale system.</p>
<p>It's on the other end, it is definitely not an infinite mathematical fractal that where you just where you can drill down endlessly into subtlety? How many layers down are there?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>Some have postulated up to 4 layers in terms of the yoga. Chara school for example, in India but who knows? Maybe there's more this awaits a true neuron based neuroanatomy based science model for these systems. I don't know how many layers. There are down there, but you know it, maybe a half dozen this is a guess certainly.</p>
<p>Not infinite literally, although it seems to us infinite because.</p>
<p>Each one is exponentially both bigger an finer than its predecessors. So it seems to point to Infinity. But that's just an optical illusion. It's finite as far as I can tell and when you get to the base of the.</p>
<p>Of the iceberg, so to speak you'll find that it is floating in the ocean of pure spirit.</p>
<p>So I don't have to worry one of the things that makes it so challenging to untangle the fit system is that the tangling is at all those levels, but eventually it all sort of unwinds the skein on wines and things become very, very simple and when that happens, we could say that.</p>
<p>The true beauty of your soul.</p>
<p>Has been manifested?</p>
