                  <h1>The 'Secret' of Archetypal Deity Yoga</h1>
                
                <p>By the time. My Yana evolved in of a driana the religious stuff was really intense. So now the Buddha is a deity.</p>
<p>And to be come up with that means to be comma, deoti so how is that feasible.</p>
<p>Well, what they did is they did something very, very clever.</p>
<p>They.</p>
<p>Showed People how they could become ADATA God, it's called deity yoga.</p>
<p>Yoga in the sense of merging by the way.</p>
<p>Plane and you're in the Tibetan language.</p>
<p>Now you've probably heard that.</p>
<p>Tibetan Buddhism is secret Buddhism, there these secret initiations.</p>
<p>So now I'm going to give away the secret to all of you.</p>
<p>Yes, that's right here's the secret of secret Buddhism.</p>
<p>How do you become a deity?</p>
<p>In a way that is not insanity or possession.</p>
<p>By the way.</p>
<p>How do you become a deity in a way that brings about the same incited liberation as the deconstructive process of early Buddhism.</p>
<p>Very clever.</p>
<p>Here's how you do it.</p>
<p>You replace your internal talk with the mantra of the deity.</p>
<p>You replace yourself image.</p>
<p>With the image of a deal.</p>
<p>And you replace your normal human feelings with the feel of the deity and you form the touch of the deity by making.</p>
<p>Hand gestures mood dress, so touch feel image talk.</p>
<p>Of a myth.</p>
<p>You become the myth.</p>
<p>As I say</p>
<p>Not to be insane.</p>
<p>And not to be possessed, but to gain insight into Watt.</p>
<p>Insight into the arbitrary nature of self identification because you created this alternate identity from scratch.</p>
<p>And you know.</p>
<p>It's a map.</p>
<p>Yet you becoming very clever. It was a way of meeting the People where they were at they were worshipping these archetypes.</p>
<p>Buddhism had really moved from its early sort of good as a spiritual scientists just another guy, but an extraordinary guy too.</p>
<p>OK, but as an archetype so now.</p>
<p>So now become the archetype and you'll get the same insight into how the sense of self arises so once again. We're working with feel image talk aren't we?</p>
<p>Broadly.</p>
<p>It's another way to do focus on positive.</p>
<p>As I defined focus on positive.</p>
<p>So, in Tibetan Buddhism, they in the core of these if you look at the surface. It looks like they're doing. These rituals, but inside there doing DD, yoga, where there be coming. This deity than becoming this other day, then becoming this other deity.</p>
<p>In order to see that.</p>
<p>When you work with those elements. Those are the elements that create the illusion of self if it can create the illusion of a mythical self. Then it certainly can create the illusion of your ordinary self and you gain the same insights.</p>
<p>So one of the reasons that I define focus on positive so broadly is to allow some students.</p>
<p>Who wish to todo deity yoga? Some of my students that relate to that I would never encourage a person to do this. But some of them want to do it and it could be very insightful well. The focus on positive technique that I give you is so broadly defined that it includes within it. Not only early Buddhist loving kindness. But DD yoga, 'cause you're working with those elements in a very systematic way.</p>
<p>Lot of times Westerners if they want to do this will not choose the deities of India and Tibet.</p>
<p>They'll choose Western archetypes that certainly my case when I do this.</p>
<p>I typically use love your hand like Wanna, Lupe, Virgin of Guadalupe 'cause I grew up seeing that in LA.</p>
<p>And that's like you know that's a very it's very natural for me. So I use of Emory's yeah, so you got the little Jewish boy from LA does the Catholic Tantric practice?</p>
<p>Well, that's the world we live in.</p>
<p>But it works, you can do with any archetype.</p>
<p>And in fact.</p>
<p>Traditional way that you're supposed to be taught to do. The Rosary is you visualize the mystery. You have the certain prayer and talk space and you're supposed to experience emotions and your touch wise engaged with the rosary. It's the same elements OK. It's it's right there.</p>
