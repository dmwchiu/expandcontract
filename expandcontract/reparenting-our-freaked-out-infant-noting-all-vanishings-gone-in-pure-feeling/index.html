                  <h1>Reparenting Our Freaked Out Infant - Noting All Vanishings & Gone in Pure Feeling</h1>
                
                <p>I was focusing on Vanishings and the Vanishings became ubiquitous just like it's everywhere. But in the past when I've noted vanishings say with the breath.</p>
<p>It's actually been a sort of soothing experience with sort of an afterglow of peacefulness, but I found this experience of noting banishing to be highly agitating.</p>
<p>I think the implied question is what does that mean and what should I do?</p>
<p>Uncomfortably stimulated agitating, noting noting nothing whatsoever has resulted in a lot of uncomfortable something.</p>
<p>How closely correlated would you say in a certain amount of guessing may be involved on this?</p>
<p>How much correlation would you say there is between the?</p>
<p>Fact that you were noting vanishing and the fact that you're sort of hyped up In other words does it seem highly correlated with that that really had something to do with it or does it more well the potential was there and I might be hyped up because of other things.</p>
<p>I'd like to eat to make a guess is it because you said it well. I'm sort of excited about this prospect and that and I haven't had the sugar fix or the coffee fix so it's not that but it might have been some other things you sort of intimated so.</p>
<p>Do you think that the noting of banishing played a large role in this or?</p>
<p>Other factors may have entered in and the answer not sure at all is completely valid.</p>
<p>So there there's a pretty strong correlation between the paying attention to nothing, and a lot of agitating something.</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>Now that's what I wanted to determine or may be uncomfortable but it's good as far as practice goes.</p>
<p>Is it mostly well you report a lot of talk but would you say that the agitation is primarily in feel image or talk if it's primarily in field?</p>
<p>So I don't want to put words in your mouth so correct me. If this is wrong, but the just that I'm getting is.</p>
<p>I was noting vanishings, which usually is a peaceful experience for me.</p>
<p>But this time and I usually note vanishings. Justin the breath. The ends of the ends and out breaths or external sounds but.</p>
<p>2 things happen this time that are very different first of all the vanishing globalized, too. It's like everything's vanishing.</p>
<p>And Secondly it was agitating and specifically agitating at the level of pure emotion in the body.</p>
<p>That more or less nail it.</p>
<p>OK, that's called precision and we have a vocabulary that allows for this kind of precision and now that I've hold it down to that I can give a pretty confident answer.</p>
<p>With regards to the two implicit questions, which is why is this happening and what should I do about it?</p>
<p>Why it's happening is because you really did the technique well?</p>
<p>The vanishing points us.</p>
<p>To the most.</p>
<p>Primordial primitive experience that a human being can have.</p>
<p>Which is a non human experience and actually the ultimate grounding?</p>
<p>Groundless grounding.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>If it points us to the ultimately primordial or primitive experience that any human being can have so primitive that is not human.</p>
<p>There must also be.</p>
<p>The second most primitive experience that a human being can have.</p>
<p>That's pretty close to it.</p>
<p>And that is definitely a human experience.</p>
<p>And that is the experience of primordial chaotic feel of the infant.</p>
<p>You died.</p>
<p>Of 1000 little times team or little deaths.</p>
<p>Into the Ganz.</p>
<p>And when you came back, you came back as a little infant body.</p>
<p>With freak out chaotic feel.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>That's really, really, really good.</p>
<p>That's the good news why? Because well that in and of itself wouldn't be good news. But that combined with the fact that you're an experienced meditator is very good news.</p>
<p>Because then you just note feel, and it's vanishings.</p>
<p>And you'll be working through the first thing that separated you from your spiritual source the very first thing.</p>
<p>In the first weeks and hours of life.</p>
<p>You get to work at that level.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>All you have to do is note feel an it's finishing.</p>
<p>And all the other vanishings.</p>
<p>And you know the quantum see right now, you're an adult meditator.</p>
<p>Then you were a helpless infant.</p>
<p>Now you gotta super at all, you're better than an adult. The adult meditator will apply the technique of noting feel an will note vanishing and include the feel vanishing in that technique and the adult meditator will therefore work through that primordial level of freak out of the infant.</p>
<p>And that's the linchpin on the freak out of the adult.</p>
<p>And, of the teenager and all the intermediate levels.</p>
<p>From infant to adult.</p>
<p>Sasaki Roshi says that the first thing that happens.</p>
<p>After 0 breaks apart.</p>
<p>Is expansion and contraction pull in opposite directions?</p>
<p>And they?</p>
<p>Cause a creation of a cleft of pure space.</p>
<p>But because expansion is pulling out and contraction is pulling in that space vibrates.</p>
<p>And it vibrates into pure.</p>
<p>Heat of feel.</p>
<p>Joan accent in Japanese Joe means pure feeling on alloyed with anything else and netsu means heat and he says if you can detect that that is the beginning of the self.</p>
<p>That's the primordium of self.</p>
<p>The true primordium of self is the space.</p>
<p>And the source of the space is space lus.</p>
<p>But the first thing that is in some sense of self and not impersonal is that pure heat of feel.</p>
<p>And if you can detect.</p>
<p>And complete it.</p>
<p>Then the part of it that came from the expansion goes back to expansion the part, they came for contraction goes back to contraction.</p>
<p>And the freaked out infant becomes its cosmic parents.</p>
<p>And that 0 is re established the next gone.</p>
<p>And you are that and you do that long enough you will have completely re parented yourself.</p>
<p>And the adult that then will arise from that process will be called an enlightened human.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>OK, the comment was I was thinking of taking a nap.</p>
<p>But now maybe I should sit.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Either is fine.</p>
<p>Either is fine.</p>
<p>There's a case for either one need to take your ego death in manageable doses.</p>
<p>Don't worry, it will probably happen again. Or maybe that's a do worry. I don't know, but that it took a long time, but that's</p>
<p>The way I like to work to really.</p>
<p>Find out what's going on, I don't like to shoot from the hip as far as answering peoples questions. But you see how we pinpointed exactly what was going on. We had a precise vocabulary.</p>
<p>And I gave you what I would consider to be an optimal response strategy.</p>
<p>And we're done.</p>
