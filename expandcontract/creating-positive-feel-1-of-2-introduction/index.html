                  <h1>Creating Positive Feel - 1 of 2 - Introduction</h1>
                
                <p>We started with having you.</p>
<p>Explorer just the spontaneous presence of positive feel in your body which you didn't actually you were able to do that to a certain extent, but then it went away and it didn't come back, which is not uncommon.</p>
<p>Finding positive field is only one way to go about the technique of working with positive field.</p>
<p>Another thing that you can do is you can create intentionally create positive field and then focus on it, and one of the easiest ways to create positive field is too briefly intentionally make a positive thought.</p>
<p>That's likely to make you happy or loving or joyous and so forth.</p>
<p>Thought is something you have control over thought is your mental image in your internal talk or both at the same time, so you briefly sort of think thought that's likely to give you a pleasant field and it could be anything of your choice.</p>
<p>And then</p>
<p>You sort of drop that and you tune into how that pleasant feel may continue to resonate in your body even after you've dropped the thought.</p>
<p>And then you focus in on it, the same way we focused in on the pleasant field. It was just there spontaneously. But in this case if the sort of resonance of positive feel goes away.</p>
<p>Then you think you think the same thought or a different thought just briefly just enough.</p>
<p>To get the body vibrating again with the momentum of pleasant field and I call that triggering the positive feel.</p>
<p>Buy a brief intentional thought that makes sense is a concept, and you may have to make the intentional thought frequently or it may be that your body is emotionally very resonant.</p>
<p>And so just like you think a positive thought and maybe for 30 seconds or 3 minutes. Your body continues to resonate and now you're focusing in on it with concentration and so forth and the metaphor that I use for that is if we imagine that your.</p>
<p>Your emotional body Isabel so this is your emotional body Bell.</p>
<p>And it's sort of passive. It just responds and this is your thought which you have control over.</p>
<p>So if you briefly think a positive thought.</p>
<p>That's going to resonate that that's like striking emotional body Bell and then you can tune into the residence for as long as it may last then strike again. If need be so we're going to do it for the fun of it with external sound.</p>
<p>So I'm going to strike it and then I'd like you to listen to it until it's completely there's no more resonant resonance anymore.</p>
<p>I'll do the same.</p>
<p>But we could strike it again as need be so does that make sense very good so.</p>
<p>Will call that triggering positive field but our focus isn't the thought our focus is still pure body were training your emotional circuits to strengthen the positive emotional muscles. So to speak. It's like physical therapy like a lot of People if they have.</p>
<p>If they don't exercise muscles. They atrophy and then you have to give them physical therapy and then those muscles get strong so there's sort of like.</p>
<p>Positive emotional circuitry within our brain. But if we don't exercise it. It might atrophy People that are depressed for example, or whatever and this exercise that I'm showing you is a sort of emotional physiotherapy. Its strength and see at refeeds circuits and gives you a tendency your body parts to your body at tendency to go to positive emotional experience as opposed to negative.</p>
<p>So should I be trying to email, it different parts of my body, as a general principle.</p>
<p>When you detect the pleasant field.</p>
<p>With this technique, you try to intentionally spread your attention as broadly as you can within it. In fact, if possible. You try to experience it over your whole body.</p>
<p>If possible, but you can't force that so however, wide it may be present in your body right left front back up down you sort of stretch your attention over it.</p>
<p>And if it gets really strong.</p>
<p>Which it will with practice it will fill your whole body?</p>
<p>And then when it gets really strong it will seem to be larger than your body and like it's radiating out into all 6 directions and you sort of like this.</p>
<p>It's sort of like this high wattage transmitter.</p>
<p>And then you start walking through the world like that, and that.</p>
<p>Has an influence that's an advanced level of the practice.</p>
<p>Makes sense at least conceptually sounds like a pretty good idea right? Yeah.</p>
