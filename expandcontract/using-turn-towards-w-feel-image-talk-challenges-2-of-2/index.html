                  <h1>Using 'Turn Towards' w. Feel, Image, & Talk Challenges - 2 of 2</h1>
                
                <p>I find that I typically don't have just one flavor of challenging field.</p>
<p>I may I may say to myself, I'm angry.</p>
<p>But like and like I say I'm not sure this is true of other People or whether it's a stage in practice or just idiosyncratic to me, but</p>
<p>I may say to myself, I'm angry, but when I look when I do a flavor analysis of what's going on?</p>
<p>It seems to me that.</p>
<p>It's like wine.</p>
<p>It's got a full nose and it's got some tannins and there's hints of Raspberry. And Apple with with long syrupy finish. They give you this descriptions like?</p>
<p>Did somebody just make this up I mean? Does somebody actually experience that when they drink this wine if you're not a wine connoisseur. It is like? What are they talking about? Well, there's all of these nuances in wines if you're into such things? Well, I guess I'm not much of a wine connoisseur for a number of reasons actually probably that's a good thing. But I have sort of become an affective some esthesia.</p>
<p>Affect if is the fancy Latin word meaning related to emotion somas body as Thesia is sensation so affect if so much. Thesia is the long Latin Greek way of saying feel now. I detect all these subtle nuances. Like Yeah, it's anger. But that his sadness there and Oh yeah, there's this fear of my back, OK, so suddenly significant.</p>
<p>Subtle flavors that may be very mild relative to the main flavor.</p>
<p>If they multiply in have a huge effect if you got 10 unit SUV.</p>
<p>Sad let's say 10 units of anger.</p>
<p>But you got 2 units of.</p>
<p>Fear.</p>
<p>And 2 units of sadness.</p>
<p>And you don't notice the fear and sadness.</p>
<p>There, there, then instead of having 10 + 2 + 2, you're going to have 10.</p>
<p>Times, 2, * 2.</p>
<p>They're going to multiple they're going to weigh in multiplicatively rather than additively.</p>
<p>That's part of what I mean when I say subtle is significant so.</p>
<p>Divide and conquer that's another way of saying untangle and be free.</p>
<p>So and if that doesn't work subdivide until you do conquer your noting feel image talk OK well. Maybe we need to divide the feeling to flame.</p>
<p>And then I'd work just with the anger and then just with the fear flavor and just with the sadness. Flavor work with them individually until there is clarity is little more equanimity. Then, when I generically note feel I'm aware of all of 'em, but they've been individually clarified any quantum eyes so.</p>
<p>Now, as an aggregate their clarified and quantum eyes if that doesn't work subdivide until you do conquer? What's after you broken it into flavors? What's next right the flavors into locations.</p>
<p>I'll work just with the sadness.</p>
<p>And I do what I call radio sweeping so OK, so I got the ache in the heart.</p>
<p>So go to the core of that now how far does it extend to the rightness sort of sweep the awareness out like a cone going to the right until I come to the end of sensation. Maybe it's in the body. Maybe it's at the skin. Maybe it's between the skin on the wall. Maybe it's beyond the wall.</p>
<p>I move out here, I get that whole sector.</p>
<p>And it's like OK that's just the sadness just in that sector on the right come back in now. The sector on the left just that flavor? How far does it go now in front behind above below so I do flavor by flavors sector by sector.</p>
<p>Until I get it to manageable pieces. It's a time space volume of one flavor of sensation.</p>
<p>And that's</p>
<p>That's</p>
<p>Untangled enough so that I can.</p>
<p>Penetrate that penetrate means get a sense that my awareness is soaking into it and my being is opening up to it, and then you integrate it. So I worked with all the flavors in all the different all the flavors in all the 6:00 sectors.</p>
<p>OK and I worked with the image I worked with the talk OK. Now let's go back to generic too broad OK just not feel image talk, but now individually have sort of.</p>
<p>Been worked with them individually. So now collectively their clearer and more equalized clothes getting closer to complete experience. You have to let go of the agenda.</p>
<p>To get answers.</p>
<p>And you have to let go of the agenda to get comfortable OK. The normal reward is get answers, I get comfortable.</p>
<p>If you let go of the agenda to get answers and get comfortable.</p>
<p>You still you still get a reward at some point you get the taste of purification.</p>
<p>And even if you don't have answers and you're not comfortable.</p>
<p>That's enough of a reward.</p>
<p>Easy place to learn it in pain.</p>
<p>Much more challenging place to learn it enraged her grief.</p>
<p>Shame embarrassment humiliation.</p>
<p>Is it learnable by?</p>
<p>Me or you or actually any other human being? Absolutely. You just have to want it. You have to want it. You have to want it a lot you have to realize it's important.</p>
<p>If you're willing to do that then.</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p>Start to see that yes, there's light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>Sasaki Roshi talks about becoming human being of complete feeling.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>So that's an awesome attainment to be a human being of complete feeling.</p>
<p>Can you do it? Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can do it, there's no person in this room that can't do this, if they want to and if they take measures so the measures are implement the technique.</p>
<p>Do it on a consistent basis here, you have nothing to do, but it it's wonderful in that sense, now of course.</p>
<p>Because we're dealing with.</p>
<p>In a sense the ultimate evolutionary challenge right, it's the robot.</p>
<p>Trying to</p>
<p>Gain control of itself.</p>
<p>Trying to be free.</p>
<p>The robot was designed by evolution to be a robot so it's the ultimate challenge really.</p>
<p>When those sensations come up.</p>
<p>They were designed by evolution to give.</p>
<p>Immediate.</p>
<p>Approximate.</p>
<p>And intense responses.</p>
<p>For the animal in the Velde.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>Immediate approximate an intense responses are not necessarily called for in human society.</p>
<p>But because they were honed by evolution to do this.</p>
<p>Instead of motivating and directing which there meant to do and that's fine.</p>
<p>They often end up driving and distorting the they is feel active the feel flavors.</p>
<p>Instead of motivating a directing.</p>
<p>Which they do? Do many times and that's fine? We're not trying certainly not trying to get rid of feel.</p>
<p>Or deny it in any way whatsoever, we're trying to love it to death.</p>
<p>To completeness.</p>
<p>When you have complete feel it only motivates and directs it does its job.</p>
<p>It loses its power to drive and distort.</p>
<p>But it's a long, long task.</p>
<p>Yes, I just described a tough job.</p>
<p>But somebody's gotta do it.</p>
<p>Guess who those somebody's are.</p>
