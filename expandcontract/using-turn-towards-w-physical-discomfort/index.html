                  <h1>Using 'Turn Towards' w. Physical Discomfort</h1>
                
                <p>Now we know what the IT is in the case of physical discomfort. It's the local uncomfortable touch, possibly the global spread.</p>
<p>And possibly feel image talk reactions that's the IT, however.</p>
<p>I'm giving you general principle that you can apply to any sensory challenge. Now there's a tendency to think that Oh if I'm going to turn twords it.</p>
<p>I have to turn towards the most horrible intense solidified part of it.</p>
<p>However, that is, although there's nothing wrong with that that is certainly not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>Where I like to start is I look at the sensory challenge and I ask myself? What's the weakest link?</p>
<p>Which component in the sensory challenges least intense? I'm going to go for that first?</p>
<p>Typically.</p>
<p>For me, I find that the.</p>
<p>At least at the beginning of the discomfort the least intense components are actually the feel image talking reactions.</p>
<p>They're not too strong, yet they're just a subtle hint.</p>
<p>So often, I'll start with that I won't even go to the uncomfortable touch. I'll go to OK. What's going on in feel image talk reactive to this, or in general? What's going on. Because I know if I if at some point I lose it and freak out the freak out is not in touch space and freak out is in fit space so I want to get some momentum going in and if at some point become unwilling to practice you know, I like to hell with this.</p>
<p>Etc, etc. That's going to happen in fit space, not in the physical bottom touch space can take a lot feeling in stock space is pretty vulnerable. So so I start in feel image stock.</p>
<p>Then when I go to touch I tried to detect the subtle global spread if I can.</p>
<p>And after many, many years of practice usually I can. and I work with that. It's widespread but it's not that intense relative to what's happening locally, so I sort of like work with that. I note that touch touch sort of zoom into those things, sometimes zoom out to try to get the whole spread it once which does help with the dissipating zoom in means work with a small part zoom out mean so that's spread. The attention over the whole thing, then I go into the local intensities.</p>
<p>So, which is that's the strongest link.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>When you work with the sensory challenge, you could focus away.</p>
<p>Or you can focus on it when you focus on it, you want to get a very clear classification of the sensory challenge all its components.</p>
<p>And then decide well do I want to go to this, which component do I want to go to know. I want to work with them. All at once, etc, etc. So like I say I typically work with the weakest link and then I sort of work my way up and then I work with it all at once.</p>
<p>But usually by that time, it's breaking up into flow.</p>
<p>Meaning that it's not so solid anymore. It's beginning to show way. Venus bubbliness that kind of stuff. So now I'm noting touch feel image talk, but it gets very flowy, so at some point I'm just zooming out and I'm covering touch feel image. Talk all 4 simultaneously as a flow field. They integrate into a single body mind arabesque of Energi.</p>
<p>And if it works right the.</p>
<p>I just get this.</p>
<p>Flavor of purification and get this sense that.</p>
<p>Because of the way that I'm.</p>
<p>Experiencing this moment every moment of the of my life in the future is going to involve less suffering and more fulfillment.</p>
<p>And Furthermore, the poison and pain that has been stored from the past, is getting worked out. So the present is reaching into the future, making a brighter future for me and the present is reaching back into the past and cleaning that up for me, I called that experience the flavor of purification.</p>
<p>Probably the most important watershed in a person's practice is when they start to develop an awareness of that flavor because after that, it takes off like a hockey stick.</p>
<p>It's exponential because now now you're getting a reward an actual reward for your for your mindfulness you're actually tasting.</p>
<p>Not.</p>
<p>You know when the retreats over you know when the sits over. But like right now in this instance, you're tasting that this is doing something significant and productive for you so there's.</p>
<p>Not a reward there, I personally.</p>
<p>Have seen People.</p>
<p>Sit for 3 days without moving.</p>
<p>And I could tell you how it's done.</p>
<p>Stung with a smile on the face.</p>
<p>So so Watt.</p>
<p>Somebody's genetically engineered to do this a human can do this.</p>
<p>No a human can train themselves along the lines of what I just said, so that the sense of this is meaningful an purgatorial.</p>
<p>As opposed to meaningless and hellish.</p>
<p>That sense is present moment by moment and so there's a smile on the face even though the pain is hour after hour right on the cusp of fainting intensity.</p>
<p>And this is the easy thing.</p>
<p>Now you want to know what the hard thing is.</p>
<p>OK, this isn't that easy I know.</p>
<p>But relative to something else. This is relatively easy when the uncomfortable touch breaks up.</p>
<p>You're beginning to have a complete experience of uncomfortable touch when the uncomfortable touch turns into purification flavor. You're well on your way to complete experience and you remember, I talked last night about.</p>
<p>The two things right getting over the self in the world and improving the self in the world.</p>
<p>You get over the self in the world by having what I call a complete experience of yourself and the world. The relatively easy thing is.</p>
<p>To have a complete experience of uncomfortable touch.</p>
<p>The harder thing is to have a complete experience of uncomfortable feel.</p>
