                  <h1>Enlightenment Maps and Models</h1>
                
                <p>Is there a best model or map for the various stages of the spiritual path including classical enlightenment and all of its?</p>
<p>Ramifications the places the directions that you grow from it.</p>
<p>Is there a best model of best map? It is possible that there is?</p>
<p>I don't think anybody has found it yet.</p>
<p>Probably what comes to mind for most People when they consider looking at the various models Maps stages and so forth that have been developed in the past.</p>
<p>Probably what comes to most people's mind is well, which one is the most complete which one is the deepest which one is really tells where it's at etc, etc.</p>
<p>But for me.</p>
<p>When I think about the various models Maps for stages of spiritual unfolding.</p>
<p>The first thing that comes to my mind.</p>
<p>Is?</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Poor they all are actually.</p>
<p>None of them is really very good.</p>
<p>Now you might think that that that is a very shocking thing and maybe that's a disturbing thing.</p>
<p>To hear a teacher like myself say something like that.</p>
<p>But actually I take this as a huge, huge positive.</p>
<p>Let me repeat the disturbing shocking upsetting statement that none of the models and none of the paths is very good.</p>
<p>Is for me a huge positive?</p>
<p>I wonder if you can guess why.</p>
<p>Can you guess?</p>
<p>I think that.</p>
<p>There is a lot.</p>
<p>About enlightenment that is not normal.</p>
<p>And is important.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>No living teacher.</p>
<p>Nose.</p>
<p>Very much about enlightenment, even the deeply enlightened teachers and I think that no teacher of the past new very much about enlightenment.</p>
<p>Perhaps.</p>
<p>There may be.</p>
<p>And probably is.</p>
<p>Just a lot.</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>Could not be known within the limited confines of?</p>
<p>Prescientific cultures the prescientific viewer things.</p>
<p>Now that we live in a scientific culture.</p>
<p>We can start to.</p>
<p>Look at the mentions of enlightenment that none of the Masters of the past, could have thought out.</p>
<p>And I suspect, although I cannot know for sure. I can conjecture and I don't think it's an unreasonable conjecture.</p>
<p>That we will discover radically.</p>
<p>Innovative dimensions.</p>
<p>Of enlightenment that.</p>
<p>Are very, very important assuming there's no catastrophic collapse of human culture?</p>
<p>For the next many centuries.</p>
<p>I think it is.</p>
<p>Highly probable.</p>
<p>That a vastly improved.</p>
<p>Science and technology of enlightenment will be discovered by humanity.</p>
<p>So for now.</p>
<p>Given that none of us teachers.</p>
<p>Is very good?</p>
<p>And that none of our Maps are very good.</p>
<p>That may take a little bit of the pressure off of you in terms of finding the best teacher and the events map.</p>
<p>The best of what's not very good.</p>
<p>We have to be humble, about that.</p>
<p>All of us teachers.</p>
<p>No matter what their depth of personal enlightenment.</p>
<p>Have to be very humble.</p>
<p>In Science,</p>
<p>This is how it works.</p>
<p>You make a</p>
<p>A theory and it has certain implications. You then do experiments or you observe and you see well.</p>
<p>Did those things that this theory implied happen?</p>
<p>If they didn't then you have to modify or reject the theory.</p>
<p>Usually, it's not so much a rejecting as a improving process.</p>
<p>A really good.</p>
<p>Map.</p>
<p>Of Enlightenment,</p>
<p>Would make enlightenment?</p>
<p>Readily available too.</p>
<p>Great masses of human beings.</p>
<p>Essentially anyone on the planet with informed consent.</p>
<p>Who had an idea of what it was?</p>
<p>Anne thought they wanted this should be able to have it if we had a vest map anifest technology.</p>
<p>The fact that this doesn't happen.</p>
<p>To me indicates that we've got a long way to go and that's a huge positive.</p>
<p>Because if what someone in India discovered 2500 years ago is the last word.</p>
<p>The best.</p>
<p>And cannot be dramatically evolved from.</p>
<p>Then.</p>
<p>We're really screwed up.</p>
<p>We're in bad shape.</p>
<p>Now I know the Buddhist tradition says well it is the best. It's just that. The nature of our impurities is so deep and we have all this reincarnation and it takes the Brazilian lifetimes, etc, etc. I would say that could be the case, but to tell you the truth. I don't see any compelling evidence.</p>
<p>But that is the case and my gut tells me as a modern person, a sceptical modern person my gut tells me.</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>We can do a lot better.</p>
<p>And my own teacher who is very traditional Sasaki Roshi has said that each generation of enlightened Masters must improve the work of the previous generation.</p>
<p>So I don't just come you know it's not just an idea that I came up on on my own and he said. Science is the model science gets better and better, so what's the best map?</p>
<p>Well, if you're young enough maybe you will live to hear about the best map.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>That's what gets me up every morning that's what I live for what can I do to?</p>
<p>Nourish the soil in which the next.</p>
<p>Lotus of enlightenment for the planet will arise.</p>
