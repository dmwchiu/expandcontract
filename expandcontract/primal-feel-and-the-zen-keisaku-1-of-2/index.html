                  <h1>Primal Feel and the Zen Keisaku - 1 of 2</h1>
                
                <p>When I lived in Japan.</p>
<p>They would carry to keep you awake and also to sort of help you with physical discomforts, but mostly to scare you into alertness, they carry keisaku in the?</p>
<p>Rinzai Zen tradition is called a kill soccer in the Soto Zen. It's the same. Chinese characters that mean wake up stick literally waking stick or wake up stick but also the same character. That means wake up. It also means startle actually.</p>
<p>And I used to carry the K soccer and like black People and People used to carry the case. Octo and whacked me and when I came back to the United States.</p>
<p>Initially moved into a Vietnamese style Buddhist temple in Los Angeles, the international Buddhist meditation center on New Hampshire.</p>
<p>In Korea town still there and because I had been in Japan and had this N background ice initially sort of taught in the Zen Mode.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I had a case soccer.</p>
<p>And I used to use it. It retreats and this is way way way back in the 70s.</p>
<p>Security was not that crazy fear that it is now at airports and so forth so I would actually carry the keisaku onto the plane.</p>
<p>And sometimes they ask you know at the checkpoint sort of like what's that right and I said, well it's it's used for giving a Japanese massage, which is true?</p>
<p>When it's done right, and I've had the privilege of having it done rights by Real Masters. I once got soccer. Dbi by Roshi Not Society, Russian, a different Roshi, who was also a Kendall Master.</p>
<p>Imagine what it would be like to be a basketball being dribbled by Kareem Abdul-jabbar, OK. That's what my body felt like it was like he could dribble me at the end of the case soccer like pick me up and put me down. I mean, obviously physics laws don't allow for that. But it sort of seemed like that. Much power at the end of that thing and what it's done right, it hits on what I think is Gallbladder 21.</p>
<p>Which is both a stimulating point?</p>
<p>And mellowing out point at the same time, and boy that is what it does to you. It causes the shower of endorphins. It doesn't hurts a little bit, but it doesn't really like hurt the way you might think it hurts all your muscles, relax all the pain goes down right down to your toes if it's done right, and you are awake, you are definitely awake.</p>
<p>So I used to carry it, you know at IBM's at the international Buddhist meditation center and but what I noticed is that?</p>
<p>As I began to move more into the Vipasana Mode.</p>
<p>I notice it first of all initially People are like really scared.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Then they develop an addiction to it, and what else they could request it the way I was doing it. So it's like I'm I'm sort of fostering fear and then addiction here.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And maybe you know it's like so I just sort of got out of the habit years years later.</p>
<p>I discovered Sasaki Row Sheet and I translated for him for 5 years, but didn't really study with him, but then I guess you know the center of gravity just gradually had a strong enough influence that I just couldn't resist so I started to go to sessions at Mount Baldy.</p>
<p>So it's like.</p>
<p>By that time I meditated for quite awhile, so I first session at Mount Baldy and there, sitting and.</p>
<p>They bring up the K soccer right.</p>
<p>They walk in a?</p>
<p>In a very menacing threatening way intentionally.</p>
<p>With a kind of mincing pace that sort of like gives you the impression at any instant. They're going to turn their going to suddenly turn around and beat the living crap out of you.</p>
<p>Now mind you.</p>
<p>It feels good OK.</p>
<p>And I've had it done to be in. I'd done it to People for years and years and years previously.</p>
<p>So I'm sitting there.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>On site, the guys Sky starts to walk by you know.</p>
<p>And this terror arises within me.</p>
<p>Uh this primordial intense intense terror.</p>
<p>Actually, I couldn't even control my body. I actually started to move so I got hit.</p>
<p>Which felt good but?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So you might think and then and that happened every time for the whole session, an for the next session, for the next session.</p>
<p>It was like that's what the whole thing was about was like I'm like sweating bullets and <strong><em>*</em></strong>* bricks. Every time these guys are carrying the stick, which is frequently during the day.</p>
<p>So now you might think.</p>
<p>That self talk would be like.</p>
<p>What is wrong with me?</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>That I'm having this.</p>
<p>Huge overblown reaction.</p>
<p>But that's not the self talk that arose not in the slightest.</p>
<p>What arose was wisdom function?</p>
<p>That understood what was happening.</p>
<p>Why it was happening and what to do about it?</p>
<p>So what was the difference.</p>
<p>115 years ago when I was in Japan.</p>
<p>And they carry it with the same threatening you know whatever.</p>
<p>And I didn't even notice it. I was so lost in my thoughts and you know in my memory plan of fantasy whatever.</p>
<p>I I didn't even notice what was going.</p>
<p>Years and years and years of meditation. Be careful what you ask for what you know how many People come to me and say, Oh, if only I could have a peaceful mind.</p>
<p>Well, you can have a peaceful mind, but there's a price to pay for a peaceful mind.</p>
<p>And what's left if the image and talk turns off what's left of you.</p>
<p>What's left of you? Is a frightened little infants body is what's left of you?</p>
<p>And so when Darth Vader.</p>
<p>Is is coming out of the world of threatening archetypes?</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>That's</p>
<p>Well, that's all that was there now could I have.</p>
<p>Turn that all off.</p>
<p>By rationalization easy just start thinking site, OK that's so and so and I've known him for years and he's a friend of mine and if he hits me it's going to feel good.</p>
<p>I could rationalize away the fear but that's not the idea. The idea is disk hour down into the infantile animal levels of your being no matter how embarrassing that might be.</p>
<p>No matter how inconvenient that might be.</p>
<p>You don't rationalize it away, you train the body.</p>
<p>At that primitive level and it doesn't.</p>
<p>It's like OK that's what's happening and I know exactly what to do.</p>
<p>And eventually reach the point where as soon as they started to carry the case Aqua.</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p>Wave of power fear would spread to me turn into flow caused me to merge with the person carrying the Keisaku and the entire room.</p>
<p>And it was like.</p>
<p>Just.</p>
<p>Catharsis city.</p>
<p>Just Bliss City.</p>
<p>So you want 1:00 this well.</p>
<p>One way to get it is work through separateness at the primitive level of the body.</p>
