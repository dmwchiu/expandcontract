                  <h1>Do You Think Sex is Dirty</h1>
                
                <p>Do you think sex is dirty?</p>
<p>I think it is.</p>
<p>Actually, it's true.</p>
<p>I do think that for most People, the experience of sex is dirty.</p>
<p>That's not at all, however, to say that I think that the experience of sex is dirt.</p>
<p>Those are completely different things.</p>
<p>A window can be dirty.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean that the window is itself dirt.</p>
<p>Dirty means that there's something covering something from the outside that's covering.</p>
<p>The transparency that would be there otherwise.</p>
<p>So for most People.</p>
<p>There is craving and unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Entering into their sexual experiences.</p>
<p>And that could be called a kind of dirt.</p>
<p>The term in Buddhism, and Polly would be agon to calculation are going to come in secondary or coming from the outside.</p>
<p>Calesa means impurity not in the sense of.</p>
<p>A urine pure 'cause you're a bad boy kind of impurity, but rather more impurity in the.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>In the sense of of.</p>
<p>Mining engineering In other words, If you have an or with that, or can be mixed. Something other than that or you're going to have Golden there are impurities in the gold a refining process removes the impurity.</p>
<p>So, in that metallurgical sense. Kilesa is an impurity consciousness is gold an there's this other stuff craving aversion and unconsciousness.</p>
<p>That's mixed in with it.</p>
<p>And causes our problems, so yes, there is this craving aversion and unconsciousness mixed into the sexual experience that covers over what otherwise would be transparent window to transcendence. So yes from that perspective we could say that for most People sex is dirty.</p>
<p>Of the 3:00 craving aversion and unconsciousness in the sexual domain because of that's because it's primarily pleasure involved. It's the consciousness and the craving or grasping around the pleasure.</p>
<p>That cause the obscuring of the clear window.</p>
<p>If we</p>
<p>Develop our mindfulness skills.</p>
<p>To the point where we have enough momentum.</p>
<p>Of concentration clarity and equanimity that momentum will automatically carry into the lovemaking situation.</p>
<p>In which case.</p>
<p>It will be less dirty and eventually not dirty at all.</p>
<p>All the dirt will be cleaned away from the window and will be able to.</p>
<p>Clearly understand.</p>
<p>The jewel that has been sort of hidden in the pedal of.</p>
<p>The petals of this.</p>
<p>Beautiful Lotus.</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with the petals of the Beautiful Lotus.</p>
<p>But when you peel them back.</p>
<p>You'll discover something extraordinary the jewel in the Lotus So what is the jewel in the Lotus?</p>
<p>Well, it's the liberation potential.</p>
<p>In the act of making love.</p>
<p>And what is that liberation potential?</p>
<p>It's a 2 levels.</p>
<p>The first level is that the act of lovemaking can potentially become a pleasure meditation.</p>
<p>Now pleasure meditationes, tricky deal.</p>
<p>Pleasure meditation is meditation. It's not the same as pleasure indulgence, but what makes the experience of pleasure a meditative Endeavour.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>As you're experiencing the pleasure.</p>
<p>You taste the effect of your equanimity with that pleasure.</p>
<p>And that effect is that the pleasure.</p>
<p>Is providing you with?</p>
<p>Greater and greater fulfillment.</p>
<p>Seemingly paradoxically.</p>
<p>As you become more and more detached from the pleasure as it's occuring.</p>
<p>You don't have.</p>
<p>Titan around its arising out of fear of being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>You don't hold on to its passing out of fear of Los of something.</p>
<p>When you stop tightening around pleasure in general.</p>
<p>Out of fear of overwhelm.</p>
<p>And stop holding on to it, it, it's trying to prevent its passing out of fear of laws.</p>
<p>When you stop doing that, then the pleasures starts to deliver for you greater and greater satisfaction clearly this becomes most challenging when the pleasure is of the most intense type that the human nervous system can produce which typically happens in the lovemaking situation there. The fear of overwhelm is obviously great, so there tends to be a tightening around the arising of the pleasure.</p>
<p>Also, the sense of Los when a wave of pleasure passes can be great, so there's a tightening around the passing of the pleasure if you can.</p>
<p>Learn to experience the pleasure without the tightening on its arising or it's passing, then you start to experience something beyond pleasure, you experience fulfillment.</p>
<p>At the most extreme level of that phenomenon.</p>
<p>The pleasure hovers right at the boundary between existence and nonexistence.</p>
<p>It's so much a wave you're so open to it that it's in a sense, not there, but it also is there.</p>
<p>The Tibetan term for that is the Oneness of Bliss and void so.</p>
<p>One level.</p>
<p>At which the love, making the jewel in the Lotus reveals itself is in this.</p>
<p>Complete experience of pleasure, which gives immense fulfillment transforms consciousness, but his paradoxical because it's both rich and empty at the at the same time.</p>
<p>However, add an even deeper level.</p>
<p>The jewel in the Lotus the spiritual potential in the act of making love.</p>
<p>Arises from the fact that.</p>
<p>The feel image talk self.</p>
<p>Has a natural tendency to dissolve?</p>
<p>Into flow.</p>
<p>And even to vanish to disappear.</p>
<p>Due to the</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Expansion of the pleasant touch.</p>
<p>And the sight and sound of.</p>
<p>Your partner.</p>
<p>And that is a direct window.</p>
<p>Into.</p>
<p>An experience that actually.</p>
<p>Happens naturally all the time in daily life.</p>
<p>Just not quite so intensely.</p>
<p>And if you can look through that window.</p>
<p>See the dissolving of your field image talk self into flow.</p>
<p>And then the disappearance of that flow into nothing whatsoever knows.</p>
<p>You may be able in fact, you will.</p>
<p>Eventually be able to remember what that experience is.</p>
<p>And replicate it with the touch sight sound of everything in the world that is not to say that.</p>
<p>All your daily experiences become eroticized.</p>
<p>All your daily experiences become spiritualized.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>The Act of love.</p>
<p>Was your</p>
<p>Synagogue your church.</p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p>That sermon was first delivered.</p>
