                  <h1>Sensory Clarity - 2 of 2 - No Self As Thing</h1>
                
                <p>You're watching TV and.</p>
<p>There's like.</p>
<p>Something white on the TV screen.</p>
<p>And this is assuming it's a CRT cathode Ray tube.</p>
<p>And I come in and I say.</p>
<p>There is no thing called white on that screen.</p>
<p>And you say are you crazy just looks white.</p>
<p>And I say Are you sure?</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>Is a magnifying glass?</p>
<p>We agree that this magnifying glass.</p>
<p>Does not change? What is there?</p>
<p>It does, however increase resolution.</p>
<p>Resolution is the ability to separate things that ordinarily fall together in perception. That's all that resolution means you all know the difference between a high resolution screen and a low resolution screen.</p>
<p>The large amounts of data coming through allow for separation of points that truly are separated, but they would tend to fall together.</p>
<p>So we go up and we look at the white an lo and Behold as we get closer.</p>
<p>The perception white goes away and the perception red, Green Blue arises.</p>
<p>The Buddha said if you look very carefully.</p>
<p>The perception I am goes away in the perception of 5 aggregates of identification arises or in another.</p>
<p>Formulation the perception body goes away and the perception 4 elements earth water air fire arises.</p>
<p>Another metaphor chop up a cat if you can believe this it's in the Buddhist Scriptures. It's like you can't believe this is there, but chop up a cow and you imagine chopping up a cow and public in modern India. Well, apparently in the booth next day. It was done and get you in a bit of trouble.</p>
<p>If he said supposing I suppose a butcher went to a public square.</p>
<p>And took a cow and begin to drop up the cop at some point, the perception power disappear. At the perception meat would arise. That's actually in the pudding scriptures? What he says, is it's even more interesting. He doesn't say just any butcher. He says Suppose a very skillful butcher really knew what they were doing where to very skillfully chop up this call.</p>
<p>Then I guess if you don't know what you do with the presumption mean won't arise perception. Oh my God? How will go away, and the perception me Quillen rocks.</p>
<p>So I think you see like letter for here.</p>
<p>The perception white goes away and the perception red, Green Blue Horizons. Well, I would claim that.</p>
<p>When you look very carefully and at least your cores subjective self of thought and emotion.</p>
<p>The perception.</p>
<p>That that is a thing and I am it.</p>
<p>Will go away?</p>
<p>And the perception feel image talk that aren't me.</p>
<p>Will arise?</p>
<p>So that's my metaphor.</p>
<p>Why I?</p>
<p>Think that this is worth looking into is this is 100% a perceptual.</p>
<p>Research project.</p>
<p>There's nothing Conceptua Linnet.</p>
<p>It's not like you're conceive of the 5:00 aggregates like Oh yeah, there. There must be habit forces within man. Yeah, there must be a thing called consciousness. And, yes, there's the physical body, etc, etc. This is a phenomenon of perceptual psychology.</p>
<p>And therefore is amenable to the research methods that we would use for any other sensory perception.</p>
<p>We don't know.</p>
<p>How red green blue?</p>
<p>Mix to produce something that is not none of them.</p>
<p>To Whit White, we don't know how the visual system does it, I mean, we know.</p>
<p>In some vague ways, some things about the circuitry, but we do not really understand how an illusory emergent property arises.</p>
<p>But someday we will.</p>
<p>It is possible I am choosing my words extremely carefully.</p>
<p>It is possible that when a person resolves IM nacin to feel image talk.</p>
<p>Something like the resolving of white into red, Green Blue takes place notice. I said something like I don't know 'cause. We don't know about the Red Green Blue thing.</p>
<p>Is white there or not?</p>
<p>What do you say about something that disappears as soon as you look closely and reappears as soon as you're not paying constant tension? What's the existential.</p>
<p>Status of that white doesn't exist well if you don't look carefully it does.</p>
<p>But then if you look carefully it doesn't so.</p>
<p>And sort of exists, but doesn't exist.</p>
<p>Something like that may be going on when People that have used my methods.</p>
<p>Get.</p>
<p>A sense of Freedom from their limited identity.</p>
<p>The perception I am a thing goes away and the perception field image talk are rising.</p>
<p>Horizon.</p>
<p>If indeed these are analogous then it is now possible to turn the lens of science.</p>
<p>On that perceptual shift, it well, it's not now possible but it will be possible in the next 50 years 100 years 200 years.</p>
<p>And maybe we can come up with a very convincing argument that yes. Indeed, the put down was right and Nagasena was right.</p>
<p>If we were to take this metaphor further.</p>
<p>If we were to go beyond the perception red, Green Blue.</p>
<p>And deeply penetrate.</p>
<p>What is red green and blue light?</p>
<p>When it's light coming out right there's 3 different flavors.</p>
<p>Or colours we call it.</p>
<p>If you ask what do they all have in common?</p>
<p>At a deep level what's red, green and blue light? What's light? What's colored like?</p>
<p>These are waves of.</p>
<p>Radiant electromagnetic energy.</p>
<p>And from the</p>
<p>Point of view that they're radiant electromagnetic energy they're just different frequencies of the same phenomenon.</p>
<p>But the word vipasa not means vipasana it means to.</p>
<p>See separately in the sense of separating out strands.</p>
<p>But we In addition to apart tivi positive needs to see a part.</p>
<p>But V as another force as a prefix, it means through or into.</p>
<p>So first you re posted on the sense of separate the strands. But then your awareness soaks into those strands and you start to experience feel image talk as vibrating space.</p>
<p>Which is sort of interesting because radiant electromagnetic enerji if you ask her physicists they'll say well. It's sort of vibrating space. Now I don't know how far we can take this metaphor.</p>
<p>I'm not not so naive as to suggest that it's anything more than an interesting parallel, but it is an interesting parallel so.</p>
<p>After you teased out the strands.</p>
<p>The.</p>
<p>Concentration clarity and equanimity go into the strands at the strand stuck to present themselves as vibrating void.</p>
<p>And then there's no distinction between feeling which talk because they just vibrating void.</p>
<p>The focus in technique.</p>
<p>Harkins back to the early Buddhist notion of.</p>
<p>Separate the strands and then penetrate the strands and see their empty impermanent nature.</p>
