<p>There was a Zen Master.</p>
<p>So... maybe you know who this was, I can't remember the origin of the expression: "平常心是道" </p>
<p>Well, you might know "道 (dao)", the cosmic way.</p>
<p>是(shi) means "is". </p>
<p>心 (shin) you might know, it means mind or consciousness or heart.</p>
<p>"The ordinary consciousness is the way." 
The cosmic way.</p>
<p>Well, what's the ordinary consciousness? </p>
<p>The ordinary consciousness is scattered in all directions and obsessing on one thing... then scattered in all directions and obsessing on one thing... then scattered in all directions. </p>
<p>Or maybe scattered and obsessing at the same time, same instant. </p>
<p>Is that the cosmic way? Absolutely.</p>
<p>That scattering...that's just nature expanding. </p>
<p>That's expansive flow.</p>
<p>That thing that you call fixation that you make a problem; that's just nature contracting, contractive flow.</p>
<p>If you look at it that way you don't have a problem. </p>
<p>It's just space dancing.</p>
<p>So, in the mind, in the body.  Both in pleasant guises and unpleasant guises. </p>
<p>And if it presents itself saliently, you might want to make it a theme in your practice. </p>
<p>In fact, it could present itself so intensely that you sort-of have no choice but to make it a theme in your practice because there's hardly anything else that you can detect.</p>
<p>That's in the most extreme cases, an experience that's technically called "bhanga". You can look it up on the Internet. B-H-A-N-G-A.</p>
<p>When the flow and the vanishing become so intense that they just dominate your experience. </p>
<p>Once again, plenty of people have become enlightened without ever having that experience. Just something to know that can happen.</p>
<p>How about external experience? </p>
<p>How about sounds? </p>
<p>Well, do they sort of vibrate? </p>
<p>Do they sort of "boom", OK?</p>
<p>Is it easy to detect the vanishing of certain kinds of sounds?</p>
<p>You can listen if you choose the right kind of music with well-defined phrase structures. </p>
<p>You can listen to the "Gones". </p>
<p>To the unborn absolute silence whence the music comes and whether it returns moment by moment.  </p>
<p>Just by choosing the right kind of music to do a music meditation with.</p>
<p>As well-defined phrase structures. </p>
<p>"Da-da-da-da-da-da-da... Gone! </p>
<p>Da-da-da... Gone!.... da-da-da... Gone! </p>
<p>Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da... Gone." </p>
<p>You can hear those endings very clearly defined.</p>
<p>So, sounds space could be an exploration of impermanence.</p>
<p>Sight is much more tricky to work with.
But if you defocus your eyes, things get sort of swirly, OK, and then you might say: "Well that's just an illusion." </p>
<p>But then you're using that to develop a kind of equanimity with sight and then when you start looking in the ordinary way there's still sort-of more fluid, OK. </p>
<p>One of the payoffs that come from late-night sitting and all-night sitting (We'll have another yaza late-night sit on Thursday, is that correct? Is that right? So you'll have an opportunity about 3:00 in the morning.)
Your eyes will start to swim, OK, and so will the external world.</p>
<p>And that can be an interesting venue to penetrate the something-ness of the so-called material world in front of you in sight-space. </p>
<p>So although it's a bit more challenging, we can have the experiences of impermanence flow and vanish in sight-space.</p>
<p>In fact, if you look carefully, each time your eyes shift, when it goes from one side to another, the world that was, just falls away.</p>
<p>It's a little tricky you have to sort of look out of the corner of your eye as you shift, but it definitely goes "ka-chunk".
That's vanishing in sight-space. </p>
<p>All of our senses have a both in their ordinary active guise of touch-sight-sound-feel-image-talk or in the special tranquil-restful-sort-of-a-meditative-experiences-of relaxation-light-silence-peace-blank-quiet. </p>
<p>In all of these experiences, there is the possibility for some hint of either flowing kind of change or abrupt vanishing.</p>
<p>And if one wanted to pursue this as a theme, one could. </p>
<p>Why would one perhaps want to do that? 
Well... it can be very... although sometimes it can be harsh...sometimes, often, and in the end, it is very soothing.  </p>
<p>And you get the sense that the substance of your being is being worked on. </p>
<p>"Energia".</p>
<p>A "working" within that is working out the poison and pain. </p>
<p>It's kind of a purifying experience. It's also a unifying experience because flow tends to flow. And it cuts across the distinctions.</p>
<p>In this path, there's a place for making empowering distinctions.  Distinguishing touch-sight-sound-feel-image-talk, these different dimensions of sensory experience.</p>
<p>There's also a place for those distinctions disappearing.
And one of the ways that those distinctions disappear in empowering way is that the flow and vanishing unify them.</p>
<p>And larger and larger pieces of sensory experience turn into a flow field.</p>
<p>And when external site an internal image external sound an internal talk flow together, then the boundary between inside and outside disappears.</p>
<p>And that's a very natural way to come to an integration.. a unification.</p>
<p>And since the fundamental separation of inside and outside is more or less synonymous with fear, clearly, you understand why I choose the word empowering in speaking about the theme of impermanence.</p>
