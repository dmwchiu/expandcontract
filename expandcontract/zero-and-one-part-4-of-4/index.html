                  <h1>Zero and One - Part 4 of 4</h1>
                
                <p>That came to represent for me.</p>
<p>Are tangible experience of?</p>
<p>Not just an integration of my thoughts and emotions, but the integration of my whole body mind self.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I still don't like discomfort, OK, but I know now that whenever I have to face discomfort.</p>
<p>It will lead eventually to the same experience I've come to expect that to happen on a regular basis eventually.</p>
<p>And the experiences.</p>
<p>That the entire body mind becomes unified and it's a really delicious experience anyway. That's Oneness, an even larger scale, so we can have the Oneness of the?</p>
<p>Thoughts and emotions, but we can also have the Oneness of thoughts and.</p>
<p>Emotions and the emotionality and the physicality of the body.</p>
<p>So most People would define themselves as a body mind.</p>
<p>Entity when you get body mind unified as flow.</p>
<p>Then.</p>
<p>That's</p>
<p>That's an integration of yourself.</p>
<p>But how about the outside world how about the world of sights and sounds.</p>
<p>What I just described was a kind of other?</p>
<p>The touch an myfile image talk, which is sort of.</p>
<p>The perceiver.</p>
<p>The IT of the touch and the me of the fit the feel image talk.</p>
<p>Becoming a single flow.</p>
<p>United when you have a complete experience of Sight.</p>
<p>External seeing</p>
<p>And at the same time.</p>
<p>You have a complete experience of your thoughts and emotions about what you see.</p>
<p>Then the exact same thing happens your I never fixates on the external side of the flower for example, here so.</p>
<p>The flower is a flow of light of colored light.</p>
<p>And the I looking at the flower is a flow of.</p>
<p>Feel image taught colorations you might say.</p>
<p>And those 2 flow together.</p>
<p>And that gives a unification of inside and outside along this dimension.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Even easier for most People is with sound that's probably why People like music, so much.</p>
<p>Because they whether they know it or not they can have an experience of merging or Oneness with the music. But if you understand the sensory components.</p>
<p>And how</p>
<p>Allowing.</p>
<p>Your thoughts and reactions to the music to arise without any interference so they just flow. There suffused with concentration clarity and equanimity so they become simply a flow of energy.</p>
<p>And the music itself is relatively easy for People to experience that as a flow of energy the hard part is to experience the listener as a flow of energy.</p>
<p>What I found interesting when I ask People about their experiences of music People that work meditators right?</p>
<p>Lots of People talked about the music gives them a kind of Energe.</p>
<p>And that means that although they don't quite have the categories clear and they don't quite realize the potential when they're having that kind of quote Enerji with the music. The music is beginning to cease being thing, and it's starting to become a flow.</p>
<p>A doing now that that's that's the easy part, the hard part is.</p>
<p>You're going to have thoughts and emotions that react to that music to experience them with constant so much concentration clarity that they flow.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>The music is also flowing so the music and the listener, literally become a single integrated arabesque of empty Energi.</p>
<p>And if you can do it with music you can do it with ordinary sounds and if you could do it with ordinary sounds. You can do with annoying sounds like somebody breathing in the meditation Hall when they're not supposed to or your neighbors blasting the stereo or you have to room with somebody that snoring, etc, etc. So you have these various rageful reactions to the Sonic invasion.</p>
<p>Well let's feel image talk and then there's the flow of the sun, it turns out that.</p>
<p>Impermanence flow change.</p>
<p>Is the Great Integrator?</p>
<p>It integrates.</p>
<p>The head and the heart.</p>
<p>It integrates the mind and the body.</p>
<p>It integrates the inside and the outside.</p>
<p>It's a vacuous integration, though it's it's a one and a 0.</p>
<p>At the same time.</p>
<p>In addition to integrating the head and the heart.</p>
<p>The mind and the body, the inside and the outside.</p>
<p>There's an even more awesome level of integration.</p>
<p>We could say that broadly.</p>
<p>Touch sight sound is it?</p>
<p>And feel image talk is me.</p>
<p>Broadly.</p>
<p>So self and world.</p>
<p>Can be integrated?</p>
<p>But there's one more.</p>
<p>Contrast.</p>
<p>Deeper than the contrast between.</p>
<p>I and it.</p>
<p>Is the contrast between both of us?</p>
<p>And the formless source In other words between creation and creator if we want to use a somewhat Western paradigm.</p>
<p>When that connection becomes.</p>
<p>Integrated.</p>
<p>When there is one with the 0.</p>
<p>Ultimate 0.</p>
<p>That's the ultimate integration.</p>
<p>That experience of.</p>
<p>Living Nirvana.</p>
