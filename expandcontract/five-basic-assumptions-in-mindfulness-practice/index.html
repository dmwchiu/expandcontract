                  <h1>Five Basic Assumptions in Mindfulness Practice</h1>
                
                <p>There are certain axioms or basic assumptions behind mindfulness, these lead to not logical conclusions, but they lead to.</p>
<p>When implemented they lead to experiential developments within a person.</p>
<p>So I say that there are certain assumptions that underlie mindfulness as I would teach it.</p>
<p>I think that they are very reasonable assumptions that they could be accepted by anyone, but they are assumptions, the first assumption is that?</p>
<p>The ability to focus on what deems relevant.</p>
<p>Whenever one wants to have that ability is better than to not have that ability that's an assumption, although.</p>
<p>Some of the work and positive psychology would seem to prove that assumption, but anyway, we can take that as a basic axiom In other words, it's better to have the ability to concentrate on what you want then to lack that ability notice by the way I said the ability to focus on what you deem relevant at any given time I didn't say that you're necessarily constrained to go around as a concentration machine always.</p>
<p>Always highly focused 8 but that you have the ability. Whenever you want to focus on what is deemed relevant in that circumstance so that's the axiom of concentration. Then there's an axiom that it's better to be sensorially clear about what's going on, then to be sensorially modeled?</p>
<p>That's another assumption in mindfulness 3rd axiom is that it's.</p>
<p>Good to be able to not fight with yourself. At least have that ability, sometimes you might have to fight with yourself under certain circumstances, but most People always are fighting with themselves in subtle ways very, very microscopic subtle ways without even realizing it and it's good to have the ability not to fight with yourself.</p>
<p>That's the axiom of equanimity. Then there's a fourth axiom that I call recycle the reaction.</p>
<p>Which is as the result of applying the axioms of concentration clarity and equanimity your sensory experience may change it may change in temporarily an unpleasant ways or it may change in pleasant ways. It is even possible that strange experiences might arise. They do for some People not for everyone as the result of merely applying what would seem to be.</p>
<p>Fairly innocuous axioms of concentration clarity and equanimity the 4th Axiom is really important because it tells you what to do, if the first three axioms produce anything that's challenging either in the sense that it's pleasant and therefore you might get addicted or in the sense that it's unpleasant and therefore you might suffer, or in the sense that it's weird and therefore you might sort of freak out as the result of applying the first three axioms.</p>
<p>Reactions might take place not inevitably not saying they will take place for everyone. Not everyone gets heavenly or hellish or bizarre phenomenon. But just in case they do remember the force 4th axiom recycle. The reaction and then there's one final axiom. The 5th Axiom, which is if you forget the first four axioms.</p>
<p>The 5th Axiom says have contact information of a competent guide and call them.</p>
<p>And that will remind you of the first four axioms.</p>
<p>So those are the 5:00 axioms 8. Euclid had 5 two by the way 5 postulate so I'm in good company.</p>
