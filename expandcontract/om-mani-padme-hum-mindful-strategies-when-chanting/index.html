                  <h1>Om Mani Padme Hum - Mindful Strategies When Chanting</h1>
                
                <p>We're going to chant.</p>
<p>What is probably the most famous mantra in the world?</p>
<p>Home money pod may home.</p>
<p>Oh man whom don't have a literal meaning they are sort of enerji words money means a jewel or a gym.</p>
<p>And Padmar means Lotus Pod May is the locative case in the Lotus. So it means something like hail to the jewel in the Lotus you're free to interpret Dualan Lotus anyway, you want.</p>
<p>Maybe the whole spiritual path the jewel is the wisdom the liberating insight.</p>
<p>And the Lotus is that compassion the.</p>
<p>Spontaneous service to others insight for your self service to others, but there's other possible interpretations. This mantra is associated with the Bodhi Sattva of Iloki Tati Farah are Bodie Sodfa is someone who practices with the twin goals that I just mentioned that their practice, not only at liberate themselves, but they be able to serve others.</p>
<p>At all the levels of meeting that are implied by that word.</p>
<p>So of a low key taste far is called Generosi in Tibetan Quad Assurion Org Wanyan in Chinese similarly in Japanese Kanzi One Archon on want am Vietnamese or 1:00 AM.</p>
<p>Quantum in Korean.</p>
<p>In India, he was a he but in East Asia morphed.</p>
<p>Archetypally into the compassionate mother form.</p>
<p>We like to start off the day with energean concentration so that help People wake up and so forth so at 5:30. We do this chant and the idea is to chat with the totality of your being chat with gusto an abandoned which is the expensive side of nature, but also chat with your ears listen to the sounds that you're making.</p>
<p>How are they matching the chant leader? Which is me in this case and broadly everyone else in the room so I will vary the pace this is called Mocha go in Japanese or moktak in Korean.</p>
<p>And I will vary the pace sometimes fast, sometimes slow so you have to listen for that. I will also vary the town. I'll reset the tone of the room. If you hear me go a little bit higher than try to match that I'm trying to gather everybody you don't have to chant.</p>
<p>Exactly the tone of the leader of the group. But you do have to chat harmonic to that, so it's in rhythm and in harmony.</p>
<p>So that's the chatting with your ear basis and then the rest. The chanting with your whole being is just totally give yourself to it now. I like to look upon chanting as a formal meditation period.</p>
<p>So it's a good thing to organize in your mind well, what am I going to be focusing on during the chat to make it a?</p>
<p>Useful meditation period and there's lots of possibilities pick. What's appealing to you. One thing you could do is just focus on the pure sound of the chat?</p>
<p>A lot of our distractions are into internal conversations.</p>
<p>When external sounds space expands internal talk space may contract so you can listen to just the pure sound of the chant you can focus on the physical sensations associated with chanting.</p>
<p>There's the breath sensations and so forth associated with the chant.</p>
<p>If you are.</p>
<p>Focusing on just the sound and just the physical impact of the chant we would say that you're having a you sort of losing yourself in the chant.</p>
<p>Other possibilities are to work with restful states.</p>
<p>The chat tends to quiet internal talks so you can listen to the quieting effect tends to relax the body. So you can focus on restful experiences relaxation if you know how to work with these if you don't now you will by the end of the retreat physical relaxation, emotional piece in the body blank.</p>
<p>Blank screen quiet head deep focus your eyes. Some People even focus on silence while they're chatting is sound is dominant? How is that possible? Well, some People know how to listen through or around sound to a background silence so some People like to explore the restful impact of the chat or you can say Explorer in ordinary experience. It hits about the sound you've got the.</p>
<p>Physical touch of the chatting lots of times People will get enerji flows associated with the chanting process. So you get like Vibra. Tori Enerji in your body that can start to pervade all parts of your experience user to hear it in your talk space. See it in your image space. And so forth so some People like to explore the focusing on flow enerji and so forth.</p>
<p>That the champ Induces That's another possibility. Traditionally, when People did chanting actually visualized in this case. They visualize the deity associated with the monitor in this case, it's of a local taste far so they actually did a sort of focus on positive they would visualize the deity listen to the externally but also internally as a mantra and access.</p>
<p>Emotions of Joy Compassion and so forth so to use it. That way so you might want to work with one or a combination of those lots of possibilities. You can choose whatever appeals to you, but do have a clear idea and explore that now when we do the mindfulness practice. We do, noting which involves.</p>
<p>Often mental labeling as an option usually People find it unproductive to attempt to label things while they're chatting. It sort of takes you away from that full involvement with the activity of chanting. But if you get really, really spaced out, then you can implement a mental labeling process so that's sort of a few.</p>
<p>Basic guidelines for how to make the chant a meditative process for you.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Ha ha ha.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
