                  <h1>Finding Positive Feel</h1>
                
                <p>I'd like you to take a moment to stretch your spine up and then let your whole body settle.</p>
<p>Sort of relax for a moment into the posture.</p>
<p>And tune into</p>
<p>With the pleasantness of the body being still and reposed.</p>
<p>Now sometimes.</p>
<p>There can be pleasant, emotional sensation.</p>
<p>Let's just there in your body maybe for no particular reason.</p>
<p>Like there's an interest or pleasant excitement.</p>
<p>Or kind of Smiley Nassor Rosiness or something like that.</p>
<p>I'd like you to go in.</p>
<p>Into your bodily experience.</p>
<p>And see if it this time.</p>
<p>If there's anything that's sort of.</p>
<p>Pleasant.</p>
<p>Sensation that could be considered an emotion like interest.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm joy smile that kind of thing there may or may not be either is fine just sort of take a look for a moment.</p>
<p>Sometimes just having a conversation and sort of fun right is smile and so forth so it makes a kind of.</p>
<p>Interested juice and body.</p>
<p>And would you say there's anything like that at this time?</p>
<p>Yeah, as soon as you say smile or joy, just sort of there just saying the word good?</p>
<p>I would like you to tune into that Smiley joyous flavor as broadly as its present in the body.</p>
<p>And any other pleasant thing, including laughter.</p>
<p>Humor.</p>
<p>Anything that's</p>
<p>Emotional in pleasant.</p>
<p>And sort of see how broadly it's present in your body.</p>
<p>And sort of cover it with awareness.</p>
<p>And focus all your attention on that.</p>
<p>If it completely evaporates that's OK.</p>
<p>But as long as it's there just focus in on it.</p>
<p>And if anything else pulls your attention away.</p>
<p>Gently return.</p>
<p>To finding</p>
<p>Positive feel in your body?</p>
<p>Does that instruction makes sense?</p>
<p>So what if it just goes away.</p>
<p>If it goes away and doesn't come back.</p>
<p>I'd like you to tell me.</p>
<p>And then we'll take it from there.</p>
<p>So what if it just sort of settles into calmness.</p>
<p>Meaning it sort of went away is that correct yes. There's nowhere does that count as another part OK excellent question, if it settles into calmness. It means that there's actually no pleasant sensation there for a moment. Will call that a form of emotional relaxation.</p>
<p>However, you can open your eyes if you want for a second now you feel pleasant like were smiling right. It's sort of fun talking whatever but now you're aware of it in your body right when it hits on your face 'cause. We've been working with it. The approach that we're using right now is what I call finding positive feel in the party In other words, you just look and see if it's there.</p>
<p>Without an agenda it's either there. It's not if it is there, then you focus on it with all your attention.</p>
<p>And then if it goes away for just a moment, then OK. Be aware that there's kind of emotional piece. You're emotionally relaxed and then either you'll find yourself, smiling again because of that.</p>
<p>And you sort of get into a cycle of emotional relaxation, creating joy OK and then that sort of going into this peaceful state and then creating joy so you might get into a cycle like that. The other thing that might happen, though, is the pleasant feel might go away and not come back finding positive feel in the body is just one strategy for the whole positive technique. There's lots of other things we can do we can create it?</p>
<p>In addition to finding it so I'm going to take you through a whole systematic procedure with start with like you're smiling now. Hey, you can find the pleasant feel right now, it's spreading OK totally open to it. Spirits your whole body and I have a question when you say it disappears for a moment or settles down to emotional calmness?</p>
<p>Is?</p>
<p>Isn't that also associated with positive iti like if well OK excellent question?</p>
<p>It is true that in ordinary colloquial English positive can mean anything, it can mean huge range of things. It could restful states could be positive or energy flow and some People who call that positive so in ordinary colloquial English, the word positive has a broad meaning in this particular system will only use positive in a very special restricted way it will be either image talk or feel.</p>
<p>That in some way is positive for you so you don't feel restful not strictly speaking within this system, OK, you're aware of body rest. But we restrict the word feel or feeling to refer to emotional sensations, which if their pleasant will call them positive feel this, once again is just a matter of convention in language, however, being very clear.</p>
<p>Within a certain system with regards to what words mean?</p>
<p>Requires a little bit of investment initially and may seem a little artificial and perhaps even a little bit fussy. But in the end. It really pays off because will know exactly what we're talking about so once again take a moment to stretch up.</p>
<p>Settle in.</p>
<p>And now bring your attention to your emotional body.</p>
<p>And it's possible.</p>
<p>For some reason, maybe the circumstance or what have you that.</p>
<p>There's some interest joy.</p>
<p>Smiley humorous whatever.</p>
<p>Even if it's just because I said the words.</p>
<p>If so,</p>
<p>To an end of that and zoom out sort of cover it as broadly as it may be present.</p>
<p>If it completely vanish is fine.</p>
<p>If it comes back.</p>
<p>Focus on it.</p>
<p>And if it doesn't come back that's fine, too.</p>
<p>Then let me know, and we'll explore something else.</p>
<p>OK, it's gone.</p>
<p>Pick up.</p>
