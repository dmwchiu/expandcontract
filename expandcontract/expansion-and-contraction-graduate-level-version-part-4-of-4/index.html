                <p>Sometimes, when we</p>
<p>Specially, if you sit for long periods of time.</p>
<p>It may seem like your being torn apart. It's hard not to be afraid of being torn apart. What will become of me by the way this being torn apart is called Punga.</p>
<p>In Pali and Sanskrit means dissolution. You can look it up on the Internet. It's experience at some People go through.</p>
<p>And some of you are going through.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>And others of you will go through, but not everyone goes through it, it has both up.</p>
<p>Eh.</p>
<p>A wonderful aspect to it because there can be like Champagne Bubbles and Blissful flows of energy and so forth. That's the wonderful side, but there can also be disturbing images of skeletons a death and animals eating you up and if this sounds like some of the things that happen in traumatic culture. That's no coincidence. I'm sure that's no coincidence. This is a human thing it, Tran sends a particular.</p>
<p>Spiritual path often in Africa. It's</p>
<p>There's an illness associated with before a big spiritual breakthrough takes place in other cultures of the shaman experiences animals eating eating them, etc, etc. So there can be heavenly side in a hellish side, so for some People that's only heavenly everything just becomes an aerosol the most blissful gentle.</p>
<p>Effervescent flow.</p>
<p>And that's the form that the dissolution takes for other People, the flow is more like being torn apart.</p>
<p>Like you just being pounded and squeezed and stretched and twisted the whole fabric of consciousness.</p>
<p>And other People get these weird images and stuff like that. That sort of skeletons and rotting corpses.</p>
<p>Things emblematic of death, which makes sense because you are after all, surrendering to the primordial forces of death, but also of life. If it takes the form that that it seems that your being torn apart don't be afraid.</p>
<p>All this is going to happen is you will be torn apart, but you will become.</p>
<p>Life and Death God and the devil won't have anything in between them.</p>
<p>To prevent them from uniting.</p>
<p>Into that which transcends contrast, all ordinary taste disappear, and there is only the V Moksha Rasa. The taste of liberation. But according to the way my teacher likes to talk. There's really 3 tastes in there.</p>
<p>The taste of life, the taste of death and the taste of 0.</p>
<p>That that which is neither life nor death.</p>
<p>But their completion.</p>
<p>The integrated body mind and world.</p>
<p>At arise never completely separate.</p>
<p>From the source.</p>
<p>Even as you're going about daily life looking here looking there.</p>
<p>It seems like</p>
<p>0.</p>
<p>Opens up expands and contracts and molds what you're looking at.</p>
<p>But it never really separates from 0, so you what you're looking at.</p>
<p>The forces that are molding you and what you're looking at.</p>
<p>And the cessation of those forces.</p>
<p>Are never completely separate that then sets the stage for a lifetime of integration?</p>
<p>And since you experience.</p>
<p>The self.</p>
<p>And the world.</p>
<p>As.</p>
<p>Coming out of and returning to.</p>
<p>The same place through the Paris Dalasis of this formless womb.</p>
<p>In.</p>
<p>Greek.</p>
<p>You know what the word for brother or sister is it's unisex word actually means sibling brother or sister.</p>
<p>I'll give you a hint there's a city that's called the city of brotherly slash sisterly love.</p>
<p>Well, the love part is the Filia.</p>
<p>Adelphos is the brother sister part.</p>
<p>Delfos, although you would never guess by its sound.</p>
<p>Is cognate to the sounds great word?</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Garpax.</p>
<p>GARBHA I've never heard of that Atago to Garba.</p>
<p>Garpax means woo?</p>
<p>To target the garbage the womb of the book does.</p>
<p>The mother of the put does the source the nature of nature delfos means womb?</p>
<p>And so adelphos means one who shares the womb delfos. A brother or sisters someone who shares the womb literally.</p>
<p>And in Sanskrit word is Scarpa.</p>
<p>So adelphos they don't sound that similar, but they are cognates. Agaba one who is shared the room. Adelphos one who is shared the womb.</p>
<p>So, your physical brother or sister is the one.</p>
<p>Who has?</p>
<p>A shared the physical world.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>The formless womb of the source.</p>
<p>Everyone shares.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>To the extent that you?</p>
<p>Have a sense of.</p>
<p>Sharing that source.</p>
<p>To that extent you?</p>
<p>Cannot avoid</p>
<p>The direct perception.</p>
<p>Moment by moment that everyone you look at.</p>
<p>Is your relative literally?</p>
<p>And not just every human right.</p>
<p>Every animal or plant.</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>The Kennel Centric view leads to a Cosmo Centric view if 0 is at the center of your being.</p>
<p>Then the whole Cosmos is the center of your concern.</p>
<p>In the sense of call to service.</p>
