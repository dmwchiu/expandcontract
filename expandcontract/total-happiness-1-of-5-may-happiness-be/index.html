                  <h1>Total Happiness - 1 of 5 - May Happiness Be</h1>
                
                <p>You know what mindful awareness is as I say one person's paradigm. You also know that mindful awareness concentration sensory clarity equanimity are cultivatable skills that's an enormous discovered?</p>
<p>So that these skills exist.</p>
<p>Is a huge discovery than any human being? Who wants to was willing to allocate a reasonable amount of time in Enerji can cultivate these skills that's</p>
<p>The cultivate ability of these things is utterly extraordinary, and this is the great contribution of Asia to have discovered.</p>
<p>Systematic ways to cultivate these things and specifically India.</p>
<p>Give credit where credits do they indic culture developed this like no other culture ever did science arose in the West. It's a real western thing now belongs to the whole world. The systematic ways to cultivate concentration power sensory clarity and equanimity arose India. Now they belong to the world that this is cultivatable and cultivatable to whatever extent you need it.</p>
<p>This is this would be the gospel. I would say of Buddhism is gospel, meaning the good news well. There's the Christian version of what the good. Notes is the Buddhist version of the good news is anybody who really wants concentration clarity and equanimity kind of have as much of it as they need.</p>
<p>If I had to put it in a phrase, If Somebody said why practice mindfulness.</p>
<p>I would say.</p>
<p>For total.</p>
<p>Happiness.</p>
<p>That phrase total happiness, which for me is a technical term that's a technical term highly technical term now.</p>
<p>To call it happiness.</p>
<p>Some People might object that that sounds frivolous, however.</p>
<p>In point of fact the Buddhist greeting in the Pali language. The language that is closest to the Buddha himself is Suki Hoto.</p>
<p>Which is usually translated may you be happy?</p>
<p>But actually if you look at it grammatically.</p>
<p>It's not may you be happy, it's me happiness be.</p>
<p>It's a third person singular imperative may happiness being.</p>
<p>Of course, implying to you, but everyone is the Universal Happiness Enlightenment in the sense of Nirvana on Ivana.</p>
<p>Was referred to by the Buddha as dip Tadamasa Covey Covey Hara?</p>
<p>Ditama means in the here and now.</p>
<p>So Cummins in this case, we could translate happy and be harder means abiding.</p>
<p>Providing and happiness in the here and now was.</p>
<p>The book does.</p>
<p>Reason to do this practice what he promised that People have to have so it's not ridiculous to define happiness as a technical term and then sort of look at that.</p>
<p>So if you ask the average person.</p>
<p>What what makes you happy?</p>
<p>What do you mean by happiness?</p>
<p>The first answer you'll probably get is.</p>
<p>Something like this.</p>
<p>I'm happy when.</p>
<p>I get what I want what they're thinking of Primarilly is.</p>
<p>I'll be happy when I get the conditions that I want.</p>
<p>Object if conditions ordinary People, one of the things that they would want to get that would make them happy.</p>
<p>Security.</p>
<p>Security sex good sex relationships.</p>
<p>Health.</p>
<p>Good weather good job.</p>
<p>A job money.</p>
<p>Reputation recognition fame power.</p>
<p>Good family life personal freedom freedom of expression food to eat.</p>
<p>Water to drink her to breathe vitality strength.</p>
<p>We covered it probe a little deeper well. People are thinking get object if conditions that I want think well. I use the word object in conditions circumstances.</p>
<p>It's not just that we want to get certain things we also want to avoid certain things.</p>
<p>Get a good reputation, but we want to avoid being shamed we want to avoid.</p>
<p>The all the opposites of the good conditions if you had certain good conditions, but couldn't avoid certain other bad conditions that you wouldn't be happy, so there's also the notion of.</p>
<p>Get conditions, I want and avoid conditions. I don't want.</p>
<p>For example, I'll be happy when I have a good job and.</p>
<p>My sister doesn't bug me anymore, OK, if we analyze a little bit more deeply.</p>
<p>Anne asked the question well? How do we even know what are conditions are?</p>
<p>The only way that we can know what our object if conditions are is through sensory experience.</p>
<p>The parts of sensory experience that we that ordinary People call self.</p>
<p>Are there body experience their physical and emotional sensations and their mind experience their visual thoughts and internal?</p>
<p>Conversations internal talk.</p>
<p>So most People would say.</p>
<p>That I am my body my mind.</p>
<p>When we talk about.</p>
<p>The sensory experience part of happiness? What we get is I'm happy when I get sensory experiences, I want.</p>
<p>And avoid sensory experiences, I don't want in body.</p>
<p>In mind.</p>
<p>I have a certain control over my image and talk there is what might be called a motor component.</p>
<p>Thought is something you do it's an action. It's a form of Karma, but from another perspective thought could be looked upon as a sensory experience.</p>
<p>Because thought comes to you through a visual means which is metal pictures and an auditory means which is internal talk so in the West mental experiences. It's not ordinarily thought of as a sensory experience.</p>
<p>But I think it's very important to be able to.</p>
<p>Conceptualize thinking as a tangible sensory experience because what's tangible is trackable and let's trackable is tractable.</p>
