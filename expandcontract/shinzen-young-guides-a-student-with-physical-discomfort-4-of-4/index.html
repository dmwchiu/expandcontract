                <p>Did there continue to be flow in mid space? Yes.</p>
<p>And as you focused on it did it have any soothing qualities or not particularly.</p>
<p>Who is more neutral? I think OK not particularly see but you could detect the movement?</p>
<p>I would like you to move your attention back into your head where you might hear internal conversations.</p>
<p>Which will call talk space?</p>
<p>And are things pretty quiet right now or is there chatter present.</p>
<p>A little there's a little chatter, but it's it's pretty pretty quiet sometimes when things are quiet in talk space there can be a sense of the kind of undercurrent of enerji kind of rumbling or.</p>
<p>Whispering with deep down.</p>
<p>Below the</p>
<p>Conscious talk.</p>
<p>Every experience that in the past, you know what I'm talking about like you did, scope out and see if anything like that is present.</p>
<p>Right now may or may not be if it's not there. That's fine. You don't think it's not like an assignment to find it, but we're going to just see if there's any of that subtle vibra. Tori flow that pre pre conscious talk thing.</p>
<p>OK anything like that at this time are things produced pretty still and quiet.</p>
<p>I had some then I had to to visit me for awhile and then there are some.</p>
<p>Top expressive so there's not a lot of that vibra. Tori's subtle flow at this time is that correct OK fine.</p>
<p>Bring your attention back to the body.</p>
<p>And see if the flow is still there with regards to the body.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Actually.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Any questions about what we did so far, no see if now we're going to go through the same exercise see.</p>
<p>If you can keep contact with the flow with your eyes open.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Axel and now we're going to go to the next challenge level see if you can keep contact with the flow and make eye contact with me.</p>
<p>So it's more like that ordinary type situation.</p>
<p>That's a lot you ended it excellent so.</p>
<p>This is pretty cool.</p>
<p>Any final questions or comments.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Anytime in your life in the future if you have physical discomfort. You can remember that, you can do things like this and what I was doing is I was doing exploratory work. I was like asking you questions seeing what was going on and then based on that I would like change the guidance and suggest certain things.</p>
<p>1st we checked out some local flow and then we found that it tended to spread through your body, so I was looking. I know that that's a tendency doesn't always happen. But if it does happen, it significant because then the person could get this sort of whole body massage thing.</p>
<p>Then I took a look to see if there was any fluidity in your mental experience at this time. There wasn't any of anything. Not and that doesn't need to be, but sometimes mind space will also flow. If that had been the case. I would have had you broaden your focus to zoom out and cover like the whole mind and body as a single flow field. But that wasn't the case and we didn't need to do that are you still experiencing it now in the body.</p>
<p>I mean, you got your moneys worth right. Just definitely I mean, the huge smile indicates the taste of purification in a Freedom from suffering so that's excellent work, so that's how it goes any final questions or comments.</p>
<p>OK, well, we're done thank you.</p>
