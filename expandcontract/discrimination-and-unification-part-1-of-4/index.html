                  <h1>Discrimination and Unification - Part 1 of 4</h1>
                
                <p>There's a Zen koan.</p>
<p>That says drink down the West River in one gulp.</p>
<p>That would be may be equivalent to say eat all the food in the greenery's of the United States all at once or something like that.</p>
<p>What does it mean to digest? What does it mean to incorporate with him if you look at the process of eating food and you look at the process of experience.</p>
<p>It might seem that there's not much relationship between them, but.</p>
<p>Think about what happens in order to in order to extract what is nutritive from food you have to break it down into its molecules and that's and you do that in various steps from coarser to finer to finer if you look.</p>
<p>At what happens, I mean, the teeth do their thing and then the tongue does its thing in the saliva and then uh all the different juices and all the different processing stations just break the material down finer and finer and finer until it's fine enough so that what has nutritive value could be extracted and accrue to your enerji content.</p>
<p>And since matter is enerji you can look upon it as you derive energy from the food either in the form of storing matter or in the form of energy that you use?</p>
<p>And then the parts that.</p>
<p>Have no place in your being.</p>
<p>By the same process are excluded.</p>
<p>Experience works, the same way.</p>
<p>If you want to digest the world drink down the West River have a complete experience of.</p>
<p>The moment In other words, or of the world because after all. A complete experience of the world is just a sequence of thousands and thousands of complete experiences of the moment.</p>
<p>So if you want to have a complete experience of the world drink down the West River. Eat everything that can be eaten like the God Shiva, then you have to learn how to have a complete experience in the moment and that's the digestive process? When you are so engaged in any sensory experience that you have a complete experience. There's no time to fix site that experience into a thing the particles become waves.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>So the experience is digested into vibration undulation expansion contraction flow. The activity of impermanence and so it can be completely internalized completely made your own.</p>
<p>Moment by moment if you digest the present eventually you will drink down the entire world and you will know that you have a very content. This is the way Sasaki Roshi talks. You'll have everything's your content now. Of course, you may not be able to have the kind of dramatic experiences that I'm describing right off the bat, but to whatever extent you bring concentration clarity and equanimity too.</p>
<p>Moment by moment sensory experience to that extent, you are digesting it and in the most extreme point form. You literally digest it down into its vibra. Tori atoms and that causes emerging of inside and outside and that's why you don't just merge with Flowers and the Sky and the rivers you also merge with garbage cans and.</p>
<p>Unpleasant People and whatever comes up in front of your eyes because if you have really good digestive Flowers. Then it all a cruise to nutrition.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>The peristalsis of impermanence doesn't just digest the experiences of the moment.</p>
<p>It.</p>
<p>Breaks up the Holdings from the past, the do, do the karmic residue.</p>
<p>That's sort of stuck in the Karma Colon, you might say I know it's a gross metaphor.</p>
<p>But actually maybe not such an inappropriate metaphor actually.</p>
<p>The.</p>
<p>Flow of impermanence.</p>
<p>When turned to the outside world gives you a sense that you're digesting.</p>
<p>The present moment, acquiring enerji empowerment richness from it, but when applied to the internal world as we sit and practice an in daily life stuff comes up.</p>
<p>Are cage gets rattled?</p>
<p>The stored pool of poison and pain within.</p>
<p>Gets activated either due to its own rhythms for no particular reason or because something happens in the outside world that gets to us.</p>
<p>This expression having your cage rattled. I think is a really good expression OK because it is our cage that holding from the past, is the prison.</p>
<p>It's our cage and when an event in the present.</p>
<p>Sort of bangs on it, we get our cage rattled when we get our cage rattled. It comes up in body experience and mental experience. Primarilly emotions or as I call it feel activity in the body and then mental image internal talk. Sometimes it comes up in a purely physical form in the body.</p>
<p>If we bring concentration clarity and equanimity to that.</p>
<p>A rising at the more it rattles, Arche Age, the more it seems to go to the depths of our being then the more will be digested as we bring concentration clarity and equanimity to those body and mind volcanoes.</p>
<p>And in the extreme case.</p>
<p>We actually digest it or re digested it wasn't the reason it's stuck there as it was never really digested in the 1st place so it sticks around.</p>
<p>So if when it comes up, either as I save from its own rhythms or because it's been triggered by something from the outside if we?</p>
<p>Have a complete experience of it. We will digest it release it and in the most extreme case it will it.</p>
<p>The depths of the Holdings from the past will turn into vibration undulation expansion contraction Energi.</p>
<p>And whatever.</p>
<p>Nutritive value we can recycle from that, we will recycle into the energycap of our being and the rest just gets dissipated.</p>
<p>It splashes ripples radiates and release is out of our being and that's the flow of impermanence as.</p>
<p>Karma digester or purifer.</p>
