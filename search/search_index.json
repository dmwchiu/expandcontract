Shinzen 'Just Sitting'"},{"location":"expandcontract/6-buddhist-consciousnesses-the-12-sensory-states/","text":"I wanted to talk a little bit about how this classification of sensory experience that I like to use related to some of the more traditional Buddhist categories. In early Buddhism, sensory experience was classified into what was known as the 6 consciousnesses. They hear the word consciousnesses, Vij\u00f1\u0101na in Sanskrit or vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a in Pali. So the traditional 6 consciousnesses are hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, body sensation and thinking. What I've done is... we have sound and sight. So that's the external hearing and the external seeing. I've broken thinking as a sensory experience into 2 components. The auditory thinking talk and visual thinking, image. And the reason for that is that if we ask people to observe their thinking, this is very intangible. How do you observe the thinking process? In order to make it tangible and sensory it's very helpful to ascribe qualitative and spatial tangibility to thinking, so here's what I mean by qualitative tangibility. There's an auditory quality to thinking in words and so forth. You can sort of hear it. So it has a sensory quality of auditory. There's a visual quality to thinking in pictures, so it has a sensory quality of visual. So that makes thought qualitatively tangible. Also the talk tends to be located in the head at the ears and images tend to center in front of behind the eyes, although they can occur elsewhere. If your eyes are closed images of your surroundings will tend to be projected out around into the ambiance. Images of your own body tend to be where the body is. So if we take the sort of mental screen in front of behind your eyes and also include the locations of around you and back on the body, this gives spatial position to visual thinking and makes visual thinking spatially tangible. Localizable. So that allows us to track the thinking process in terms of sensory \"what's\" and spatial \"where's\". Locations in space as it unfolds moment by moment in real time. This allows us to make the surface of mental experience quite tangible and observable. We'll talk about the depths later on. I break body experience into the emotional type body sensations, and then everything else. The emotional ones I call \"Feel\" and then everything else I call \"Touch\". The reason for this Feel category is that when a person has emotional experience and we're constantly having emotional experience, it's important to be aware that there will often be a somatic component. A body component. A lot of times, we tend to conceive of emotion as mental only. Certainly it is the case that emotional experiences can have a mental component of image and talk. But it's important to be able to detect the body component, especially when the body component is subtle. Because subtle is significant. Very wispy subtle emotionally colored body sensations can have an enormous effect distorting affect on people's perception and behavior. So I needed to have a word that meant body sensation that's emotional in nature, so I call that Feel and then everything else, which is most of what's in the body, most of the time is Touch. So I further subdivide the traditional Buddhist category of body into a sort of affective component and then the more physical type sensations. And I subdivide the traditional category of mind into image talk. And then for simplicity sake, I consider smell and taste to be a form of physical body sensation that allows us to have this nice symmetrical system. Now a person might say: \"Well, I can sort of appreciate that the surface of the mind is talk and image, but what about the depths of the mind?\" Well, it turns out that as you become intimate with talk space and learn how to find that space and listen to it, and likewise image space when the surface conscious talk and image sort of goes away, you become aware of subtle undercurrents of processing that are going on. A kind of vibratory matrix out of which conscious talk and image arise and that's the subconscious. Those are the depths. And those circuits are, the phrase I use is, massively parallel and fleeting in their processing. So massively parallel means their processing a whole bunch of stuff at once and it's very fine very subtle and very fleeting. It just disappears very quickly. It's actually a kind of vibratory energy. By looking at the surface for a while, you can develop a sensitivity for monitoring in real time the general level of activation of the subconscious mind. So this system allows us a way to not merely work with surface thought but actually directly in real-time eyeball the subconscious mind. So that's sort of how the 6 basic sensory spaces that I work with relate to the traditional Buddhist category of the 6 consciousnesses.","title":"6 Buddhist Consciousnesses & the 12 Sensory States"},{"location":"expandcontract/a-d-d-the-do-nothing-technique/","text":"I would say in theory. Yes, it is OK. And yes, you can do just it for the rest of your life. However, I would. Put a little addendum on to that. You want to make sure that your Doing it in an optimal way. And the way to make sure your doing it in an optimal way is at least occasionally touch base with someone who is competent in guiding you with that technique In other words, as far as just using that technique. Hey that's a classic path that will take you all the way to classic enlightenment. I mean, all around the world. The what I call the do nothing approach has been discovered and rediscovered and therefore it's known by various names. Dog chain Rippa Gomez, the path of non meditation. Those are some of the Tibetan names. Some interpretations of Zen just sitting shikantaza are that papaji calls it call off the search. Krishnamurti called it choiceless awareness. So yeah, it's a powerful form of practice but. I think you run a real danger if you try to practice. It just on your own, without occasionally having input from someone who is competent to guide your progress with that technique. So if you have a DD and you find that what I call the do nothing approach works for you and it's the only one that works for you, certainly that in theory, is sufficient go for it. But try to get some input from someone familiar with that. Once or twice a year at least so that you know that you're on Coors also, if it works. You. A sign of that would be that somewhere down the line. You're a DD will have improved to the point where you can implement other more systematic organized techniques.","title":"A.D.D. & the 'Do Nothing' Technique"},{"location":"expandcontract/a-deeper-freedom-experiences-of-selflessness/","text":"The experience of selflessness comes about in several ways. One is when you're able to distinguish the sensory components that create that sense that there is a self inside me. The model that I'd like to use of course, it's only one of many possible models. The model I like to use involves 3 sensory components. Visual thinking, auditory thinking and emotional type body sensation. I call emotional type body sensation Feel. And the visual thinking Image. And the auditory thinking Talk. So when Feel Image Talk get tangled together, then that's one of the factors that produces the sense of the conventional sense that there is a self here. When you're able to untangle them then something of the something-ness of that self goes away. A deeper level of the no self comes about when after you've untangled them, you realize that they're actually waves. \"They\" meaning the Feel Image Talk. They aren't solidified things, they're waveforms. That creates a fluid sense of self. Which is another level of approaching the no-self. There's the no-self experience that comes through just purely disentangling. Then there's the no self experience that comes through de-coagulating the elements that you've disentangled. Then there's the no-self experience that comes about when those flows, stop. And there is... 0. And that's a kind of absolute no-self experience. And then, I would say that the highest freedom comes about when you can experience from that 0, the Feel Image Talk re-arising. And you totally allow it to re-arise as an unblocked activity of personality. Before, when they arose, they were a coagulated something called Self. Or ego in the sense of ego-problem, as opposed to ego in the sense of ego-strength, which is a whole other meaning of ego. But when we say we have an ego problem, that's self as coagulated noun. The deeper freedom is when the self re-arises. But we experience it directly coming from the nothing. And it re-arises as an un-coagulated verb called a powerful and rich human personality. Coming from the nothingness and never really fundamentally separate from the nothingness. Returning to the nothingness, in a cycle. So, I would call that a fully expressed self. And I would say that that would represent a healthy experience of self.","title":"A Deeper Freedom - Experiences of Selflessness"},{"location":"expandcontract/a-mindful-birth-and-zen-parenting-part-1-of-2/","text":"Now I seem to remember last time we talked you were. Talking about a baby, possibly do you have any questions about my mindful doing burn? Absolutely. Yes. Could could you talk about? Giving birth in particular, well, you know how to work in field space. You know how to work with uncomfortable touches. You've done it with your my grades. You know how to work with challenging emotions. Well, that's all that's going to come up right you've already done it. You know that things tend to break up into flow that will be. Even more evident in the birthing process probably or what I mean by probably is there's a statistical tendency for anyone. Even someone that hasn't done practices and whatever there's a force in nature that. Makes that pushes mothers into the experience of flow when they give birth, but they may or may not be able to detect how nature is sort of moving them in that direction. But you it's highly probable that you will be able to detect that given your background, you know they'll be these challenges and you'll apply the procedures that you're familiar with. In addition to the fact that it's extremely challenging. You've also got all these forces of nature that are sort of trying to help you out right because women have been doing this for since the beginning, so the body is designed to go into equanimity and flow states during the birthing process as I say due to various. Circumstances. In modern civilization People don't know how to detect that natural tendency, so they may not exactly go with it. But you will you got the challenge level growing? But then you've got what your body naturally knows your consciousness actually naturally knows to do, which is to drop in the equanimity and flow. So those are going to race a little bit and they do in anybody. But because you have a practice. That gives a huge advantage to the forces of nature that. Are trying to make it into a good experience? So it's likely that the equanimity and flow will be able to keep well ahead of the rising challenge level likely OK the contractions start at first their mild and their spaced. And then they get more intense and closer together. You understand what I'm saying and that sort of builds to a point where they are extremely intense and very close together nature is trying to create a rhythm. And get you into a rhythm. And it starts out very gentle. An mild and without too much challenge level. If you can get In Sync with that rhythm from the get go by the time it reaches full blown intensity, you'll have become. The cosmic world space itself, giving birth there's a peak and there's a Valley. There's a peak and there's a valid pin where the change is subtle takes a lot of work to dissolve. But pain that comes in well defined peaks and valleys much easier to deal with. Because they couldn't get into a rhythm with it. And pain that starts out hardly pain at all, and with long. Intervals. But then it's going to eventually get to maximum possible. I've been told it reaches the maximum the nervous system can produce. Yet. Women do this OK, so that means that the potential for transcendence for permanent transformation of consciousness is just incredible. But you see how nature is trying to make it easy on you. It's like it's mild in space. So you get into this rhythm with it. And there are various ways that you can get into the rhythm, which I'll describe in specific and then when you finally sort of reached the periods of intensity. There's a high probability that you'll be in an ecstatic state. So. What happens when a discomfort intensifies well? It may spread when a touch. Expands. There is a tendency for the mind. To contract. And to turn off. Except if the mind freaks out if the mind freaks out, then as the pain expands the mental reaction expands if you sort of look at what the natural tendency? Is it simultaneous expansion contraction. The body physical sensations that touch expands and there's a natural tendency for the image and talk to sort of go into blank and quiet at that time. OK, that's a tendency now if you can notice that tendency then each time there's a peak. So you let the pain expand. And you simultaneously let the mind contract. OK. And so that peak drives you into blank and quiet in mind space. And then your butt big sensation expanded. But this is no mind or little mind is little sense of self. It's OK, you'll be like literally becoming flow. If you can start that rhythm off fairly quickly. By the time things are getting intense and coming fast and furious each expansion of sensation like. The body spends more, but the mind contracts into rest more so each spike of contraction drives the mind into a restful state. Now. There are also valleys in between the peaks what's the natural thing during the Valley is to physically relax the body? OK, that's not the pressures off when the Valley comes you go into relaxation, which is totally natural because the pains not there right. So then you, relax and then when the peak comes you let the peak. Dr you into blank and quiet and then during the value go deeper into relax OK and then the peak your in flight quiet. There is a tendency to when touch expands sometimes emotion react to it, but sometimes feel gets turned off too. OK and that could be a natural tendency feel arising by way of reaction might fear that can happen, but you can also see that it will sometimes turn off field and produce emotional piece is just like only so much real estate in the body. And if touch is big enough. There's no room for feel anymore. No room for emotion in the body. The cycle is touch expands feel image talk self. Thought emotion self contracts at the same time, OK, so you're aware of peaceful and quiet. At the peak and then there were physical relaxation in the Valley. Then you get into a rhythm with it and the body is. Is now being controlled by that rhythm? At the peak. The. Feeling thinking self. Is just gone it's just in peace by quiet? And at the Valley. It's easy to physically relax about the cycle takes you into a state of relaxation peaceful and quiet. You may have trouble focusing your eyes and ears at some point like you're going to pass out and your eyes start to swim. That creates might and silence. So the whole thing is just driving it into restful states. And then the restful states flow and then your expansion and contraction and the universe is expansion and contraction become a single expansion and contraction and. God. Gives birth to the baby through you so to speak and you experience that directly. Beautiful yeah, yeah that's that's how I coach women through the birthing process. Wow. Wow. Or one of the strategies if that doesn't work better other strategies about. The flow of having a baby wow. All that's beautiful.","title":"A Mindful Birth and Zen Parenting, Part 1 of 2"},{"location":"expandcontract/a-mindful-birth-and-zen-parenting-part-2-of-2/","text":"That's Zen birthing mindful birthing, then there's in parenting. That's your monastery. So the source. Blasts you away in birthday and then expects you to function immediately and big time. So, just function. You become it's like saying, you get blown away in your sons and interview and then you have to go to a job. But there's no you left so you just do the job you become the activity. We just function I ventured instead your aunties in interviews with the Zen master right mostly what you go for in an interview. People think they're going to solve these koans like what's the sound of one hand, clapping things and then you are, but mostly you're going to have an experience of merging with the expansion contraction and emptiness of that send master so they sort of like. Some of their dynamic nothingness rubs off on you each time you do sunset in an interview and then you carry that back to the Meditation Bowl. That's how that works and then but then, unlike the shock Top that the Hindus do where you sort of get zapped and then you just sort of sing rock. They sit around and seeing and worship. The grew and have some grub and then you get this app. And then you gotta go bust your *** in the meditation. All and it's cold and they're beating their yelling at you, you got to apply it right. This like you may think you got some enerji or picked up something well. Now let's see if you could use it with your aching legs and your aching. Psyche you know in the Senate torture chamber now will see did you really get it and of course? Why that's so cool is that then you're not a leaky capacitor that just like gets charged and then loses it. You would develop the strength. You could hold that and you don't become dependent on the feature for that Energi. So because you're forced to use it. You're forced to be strong. It's not just OK. We're going to let the groove is you know ZAP us and then. Sit around and talk about how great the blue is you have to like apply it to real stuff right away so that's why I like this and approach to it. They talk about transferring the consciousness, but not in quite explicitly the terms. I'm using with your mom. So you go. You pick up something of the dynamic nothingness of that. Roshi. And then you carry it back the way I look at Zen parenting using Zen here and also metaphorical is that your baby is the Zen Master. Because the baby is dynamic nothingness. It's still linked to the source so every time you're interacting with the baby. You are. You're having is an interview. That's your little Roshi OK. And you can see the flow of expansion contraction. And 0 inside the baby and it rubs off on you. So you're getting shot depart from their own baby. Food dot sight sound. Then you right on that and you're able to use it for the challenges of taking care of the baby. That's the way one way to think about the parenting. So. It's pretty cool very cool, yeah, any questions about any of this. You've talked about unforgiving at all price it correctly, but sometimes we will. Like the raw. Fear will come up and you. You said it's like an infant state of fear does that mean I understand what you're talking about and I really appreciate you bringing that up. Because I've had an experience like that. And now it gives me so much compassion when a baby cries or gets upset and we may or may not know why that is. But by me experiencing that and by you. You know. Letting me know that that's the wrong feel emotion than an infant fields. I think it will let me have a lot more love and compassion. For that child when they experience something like that. Let me ask you I want to make sure I know what we're talking about is it having the experience of a sort of like chaotic activity within field space inside yourself like you dropped into a very primitive level and there was just sort of like. Chaotic feel for no particular reason just sort of like enemy by. Doing nothing deep down there is that what you're alluding to yes, but it was, it was, it was a huge chaotic fear and just fear or was it other sensations. Mixed yeah, I think it was just fear but it was really big and then I just went grasping for an image or something to equate how big that fear was to something that I could identify with and it was terrible. Criminal situation is the image that just came in my in my mind. That's how big the fear was, but it was just the theater at the beginning, so you experience like raw fear in field space for no reason whatsoever, no and it was just like a chaotic arising and. When you apply the practice to that. Think back it was a couple retreats ago. I'm not sure if I applied for practice or not I think I was just shocked because you were shocked at how how primitive and irrational field space right right. But now you know that when you watch the baby so doing it stuff that's it's feel space, expanding or contracting so this gives you a sense of that. You have an experiential sense of what the baby is going through when it's in the it's sort of. Primordial freak out. Yes yes and instead of you know going what's wrong with you know it's like all of a sudden there's a huge amount of compassion because of what I experienced. Well, that's a excellent. When time gets closer to that event like probably like to talk to you about it about the birthing process sure again. You have left me with a lot of excitement and. I was on another retreat with you when someone went into a big labor on it online and then went to the hospital and she came back and described it during the talking circle. I think she was in labor for a huge amount of time and she she talked about how the nurses and doctors were completely shocked and how she was in labor for so long and they were amazed at how well she she did it was. Absolutely amazing. Well. This is So I think we're good? Yes yes.","title":"A Mindful Birth and Zen Parenting, Part 2 of 2"},{"location":"expandcontract/a-mindfulness-path-arising-between-empowering-contrasts/","text":"I like to think the way that I present mindfulness is based on significant distinctions. Or perhaps a better way to put it significant contrasts, empowering contrasts. Viva la difference. Between what? Well, a whole bunch of things. There's a place on this path for making discriminations. There's a place on this path for destroying discriminations. There's a place on this path for breaking down the self and the world. There's a place on this path for building up the self and the world. There's a place on this path for bearing down. And there's a place on this path for easing up. So that means that the path isn't a path. It can't be fixated. It arises in between a whole bunch of empowering contrasts. Maturity on the path could be defined as learning how to work those contrasts, how to get rid of the notion that they are somehow contradictions. See them as complementarities, and to know how to do what, at what time for optimal efficacy. And that's just practice. Practice, practice, practice. You get the hang of it. A Noting and Labeling Example of Empowering Contrasts. It's a matter of alternating. If the labeling makes you racy, OK, then try dropping the labels, see if you could still have clarity. If that makes you spacy, then you have to label again. Talking out of both sides of your mouth at once. There is no answer to this except to constantly remind people that there's no answer to this. In other words, you have to constantly talk out of both sides of your mouth at once. And say there's a place for bearing down, there's a place for easing up. When a person needs to ease up, they don't hear that you said there's a place for easing up. They only hear. And Conversely, there's just no way around it. Sasaki Roshi has this great expression. [ \u3081\u3050\u3059\u308a megusuri ] It means that people tend to apply eyewash to their anus. Right medicine, wrong place. So, in other words, If we say there's 2 sides, you can bear down, you can ease up, you can label, you can drop labels. You can even not note and do nothing for awhile. Unfortunate there's some perverse principle where if we say, you do one or the other, whatever one is that both convenient one for that person's impurities to grab on to that's what they'll. So if they got ego around performance =, they'll hear : \"I gotta perform\". If they've got ego around \"Hey, I need to cool out and just feel good and not work too hard.\" Then they'll hear that : \"Well, I'm supposed to not do anything.\" So there's no way around it. It always happens that way. No matter how many times you point out: \"Do it this way or this way.\" There's something, learn from this, there's something, learn from that. Until finally people figure it out. *Sona Sutta Metaphor: Anguttara Nikaya 6.55\" Like, the metaphor used by the Buddha of tuning the lute. How do you tune a lute? Well, you tighten the string, but then it's a little too tight so you loosen, you tighten, you loosen, and in between the tightening and loosening you just get a feel for where the lute should be. So between these empowering contrasts, you are able to work and optimally use the various sides that are available to you.","title":"A Mindfulness Path Arising Between Empowering Contrasts"},{"location":"expandcontract/a-psycho-spiritual-workout-routine/","text":"You can start with focus on ordinary and just sort of deal with the ordinary sensory experience, then you can shift if you want to focus on restful states, which is a kind of thinned out and attenuated version of the focus on the ordinary. And often after you do that, the dynamic aspect will be present. Then you can focus on flow vanishing and then the vanishing will point you towards that which is outside of time and space, that which is beyond the human , which could be called 0 or nothingness or the source. When a human being touches that nothingness, the natural reaction to that nothingness is joy, love, compassion and a call to service. So from the nothingness will arise the positive Feel Image Talk in a very natural way, and that sort of completes the cycle. It's sort of like a Psycho-Spiritual Nautilus workout.

If you're freaking out because of emptiness see that the freak out is empty. That's number one and #2 balanced the emptiness with practices like focus on positive where you're intentionally re creating a new self from the emptiness anew an positive self.

What's the point? The best way to deal with this question is to look at the question itself. Actually, it's 2 questions. What's left after Enlightenment and what's the point of the whole thing. Let's analyze the questions themselves because they contain certain. Presuppositions. I'm looking at those presuppositions will be helpful in answering the questions. If you say what's left after enlightenment? The implication of that language is that there is a single moment of enlightenment. And that basically enlightenment is this binary system you're not enlightened. Then you are enlightened and it's these 2 things. However, it has been my experience that it's not at all like that. Um. That although some People have a dramatic moment of Enlightenment, it does happen. For most People it's sort of sneaks up on them. And unless it's pointed out to them, they might not even be aware of quite how enlightened they become. Because they've acclimatized to it, so enlightenment experience does not necessarily involve one or a sequence of dramatic sudden experiences. It may but it doesn't have to sometimes. It's a more gradual process. In fact, usually it's a more gradual process. If you look at nature. You'll see that some processes in nature, discontinuous, they jump, some processes in nature and continuous. And took mathematicians quite a long time to develop a an advanced form of calculus that could simultaneously deal with both continuous and discontinuous functions. But they had to because the nature of nature is that way. And since enlightenment is part of nature, it's a natural process. It's even called seeing your nature 10 show to see your nature. So because it's part of nature, we shouldn't be surprised that. There are both. Sudden and gradual components to the indefinite so if you say what's left after enlightenment. It implies that there's this single sudden thing that somebody goes through, and there's a before and an after even if one had one of sudden types of experiences. There's still a lifetime of. Working. Out the consequences of that. Improving behaviors working through negative patterns in my own case. I did have a sudden experience that is true as the result of systematic cultivation. Some People have suddenly experiences without even having practiced that's quite extraordinary, but it does happen just out of nowhere. Suddenly, they see what in Buddhism. We call the nose. So it happened to me. Rather, along time ago, I'm 65 now and. It was a while back. But I've had to spend my entire life refining. The implications of that realizing how screwed up. I was in so many areas. Even after that experience. It wasn't all that many years ago that I saw Psycho therapist psychiatrist and MD. For 18 months to workout so behavioral issues that I felt. I needed something besides the meditation practice. So. One shouldn't think that there's like there's like Enlightenment and then there's this after enlightenment thing. It can be more gradual for one thing and even if it's sudden you got. The long, long way to go after you've seen the no self. You've got. Just seeing the ox look at the ox area. Pictures you gotta get on that Hawks gotta ride that ox in daily life so part of the problem is the formulation of the question, implying there's like Enlightenment and then there's after it like there's Enlightenment and then there's a lifetime of after if it's a sudden alarm so it's still a lifetime. Now we can have been cleared that away we can talk about well what's left. If you want to say what's left. Well let's left is a whole bunch of Screwups and bad habits. And the effort was flow of. Emptiness. And as time goes on the effort was flow of emptiness more and more eats up. The school apps in the bad habits, etc, etc so. As time goes on more and more of what's left is the effortless flow of emptiness, which doesn't sound all that appealing until you actually experience it? And then it's like. Well, if you had a choice of living. One day that way or living your whole life. Not that way would say well. I'll take the one day and you could kill me at the end of the day. That's how good the effortless flow of emptiness is more and more of what's left is less and less something and more and more doing? What's the point well. That also sort of goes to an issue of meaning. It's asking what's the meaning what's the Ultima meaning? What's the meaning of the path? What's the purpose of that. But The funny thing is, is that you have to work through the need to have meaning. Um by giving some talks about that. So that in a sense the answer to that question what does it all mean or what is the purpose? Once again, you have to look at the question and realize that there's an implication. As you begin to work through the need to find the purpose. The purpose arises spontaneously now. Could I put a word 2? The point. If you ask what's the point? Could I put a word to that point. Where the aux takes you? Would sort of be making the point everything? So yes, I can put a word to that point. That word would be love.

Don't, they realize these are just my casual opinions about things but they realize how little I know about alignment don't, they realize how little? Any teacher knows about alignment. I understand that People. Want to appeal to authority it, it's convenient innocence. Basically, the there's traditionally India and also in the Western world. 3 bases for knowing things. There is direct experience there's a logical inference and then there is. Reliable authority. What is distinctive about the Buddha as a teacher is that he rejected reliable authority? As a basis of knowing. Essentially said it's direct experience and logical inference just because a very good person says something doesn't mean it's necessarily true just because some ancient scripture that everybody believes in says something doesn't necessarily mean it's true. And just because somebody that's meditated for 50 years or 60 years. Says something doesn't necessarily mean it's true. It's their casual opinion, the best they can come up with an I think it's really important to keep that in mind. Does that mean that you shouldn't listen to what these teachers, saying all we have to listen. Because yes there's a lot, that can be learned. But it also has to be taken not as some sort of authoritative pronouncement. It's best finger that can sort of point. And yes, this person is some experiences that I don't or has more experience than I do so I can listen to what they say, but to go beyond that think that make it carry more weight than just that person's casual opinion order. Best that they can come up with I think is to miss the point. We just do our best to formulate things as best we can. So I just wanted to say a couple words along those lines. Yes, you can make use of authority to a certain degree but. I don't think that we need to give it more. Cloud then then it really deserves. Also, it's sometimes asked Well, you know how does this teacher or that teacher say map on to what's in the Scriptures? Or what's in the Canon I guess. Western religions, the Abrahamic religions tend to call it scriptures but Buddhism. They call it. The Canon means the same thing. Unfortunately, the People that are responsible for the Buddhist Canon his immediate disciples and so forth. Are not now alive meaning? We can't dialogue with if you ever come to the retreat with me? What you'll see is characteristic of the way I teach is that when People ask me questions. Very seldom do I just give an answer I sometimes do. But in most cases I find I have to ask a little more what did you mean by that. I think I understand what you're saying but it could be this, or it could be that could you clarify it's very difficult for me? To just answer a question directly. I find that interaction is needed a back and forth as needed. There is no way that we can have a back and forth with the OR his immediate cycles. It's one way. All we've got is what is in these books? And these books were not written down right away is quite awhile before they were breaking down. Now, some People might claim well. It was all perfectly memorized word for word. There is something of that memorizing tradition in the Indic way of doing things. But the fact is. Even if it was word for word. But still not enough, not really there would have to be a back and forth. To see really how does say I as Shinzen Young I'm teaching? How does that map on to the put I'd have to be able to dialogue with him. And I can't, he's gone so we can look to the Scriptures. And yes, we can get a lot from it, and we should but once again, I have rather modest. Expectations with regards to. How really Sharp. Up the communication can be between the scriptures or this cannon and us given that is a one way. St and so it's a kind of humility to understand that. Yeah, you can make use of it, but You can't dialogue with it and therefore don't impute.

This some of them will emphasize the bearing down aspect. Certainly the Buddha was in that camp. Some of them will emphasize the easing up aspect like Papa, GI love the title of his book call off the search that's my term for the sort of like. Easy ease up and stop stop striving for enlightenment. The so the talked about the Noble Quest. Papa G talks about call off the search, which one is right. Well, they're both right. So then. The question well. How do you know when to bear down? How do you know when to ease up? I don't have any magic formula for that. I can tell you how I in my own teaching attempt to deal with the paradox. My way of dealing with it is to give People techniques. That allow them to bear down that would emphasize that aspect, but also to give them a very clear description of how to practice in a non effort ingwe and the non effort in practice, which you can read about on my websites. I call do nothing. It's basically my reworking of that whole choiceless awareness jam just sit with some People would call just sitting anyway. That whole approach to things that call off the search approach. I call it do nothing and so my way of dealing with the paradoxes say OK. I'm going to give you these techniques that involve noting you know touch sight sound or feel image talk, etc, etc. There's some effort involved in that you're trying to separate phenomena and you're trying to soak your attention into the phenomenon when it arises so here's some techniques that. Within which it's natural to somewhat bear down. Here's another approach, which gives you a description of how to let go of the intention to do anything at all. Without having an intention to letting go to let go of the intention, which is sort of tricky, but if you read the description of how to do nothing. You'll see how I try to get around that I give People both approaches and I encourage them to do both to try both my stock phrases if the noting makes you racy. Then do nothing. As I define do nothing if the do nothing makes you Spacey then go back to the noting so now you have. Both approaches worked into the system worked into a system so that they can sample both and work with both. I think because it is a paradox. And because both are true that the single most important thing is to not get one sided. It's an eye, I see this all the time. Yes. Indeed, one of the characteristic dangers that you can get with. Mindfulness practice is that People get goal driven and there is a drivenness in the way that they do it, you can actually get that in any spiritual practice. The Medison for that would be to. Learn that. You don't have to practice that way. On the other hand. I have also seen People get addicted to the have no goal approach. They spend their whole life in daily life. There unconscious and driven but they're afraid to do any noting technique in their formal practice because somehow that's going to pollute their consciousness. They actually develop a an aversion or a phobia of any bearing down whatsoever. Informal practice but as I say it's sort of ridiculous because in daily life. There constantly giving them their constantly giving in to those kinds of forces of driven of Drivenness, but they're afraid to have any even a hint of a goal in practice well. That's a kind of phobia so I think that my way of trying to deal with this is well get familiar with both ways of working so there's uh. A kind of freedom that you could do either 1. And in fact, I would say that the test. For either of the approaches is your ability to do the other approach so if you have been doing a high effort ING approach? How do we know it's working well? You should be able to drop all effort if it worked. And do a no effort no meditation form of meditation. If you've been effort ingin you claim that it's been successful and productive. Then you should be able to do a non effort practice without any problem at all. It works, the other way too. If you claim that you have been productively doing a non effort practice a call off the search practice. Then you the result of that should be that you have very high concentration clarity and equanimity skills. Even though you have had no particular goal to develop those in any systematic way there for the. The gold standard for testing in my mind, the efficacy the progress in a call off the search approach would be can you implement highly? Systematic focusing techniques like noting are you able and willing to do this. Well then your call off the search has been successful. Conversely, if you've been searching very hard and bearing down that should result in the ability to completely let go of all direction and goal in practice if not, then you've been making efforts. Without the progress that you should be making and maybe you need to balance by doing the other approach.","title":"Bear Down or Ease Up in Meditation"},{"location":"expandcontract/becoming-a-high-wattage-broadcaster-of-human-positivity/","text":"This was way back at the end of the Vietnam War I was living in a Vietnamese Buddhist temple, but not in Vietnam. It was a Vietnamese ethnic temple in Los Angelus. You may remember the news footage of the People like clinging on to the helicopters in Saigon. You're trying to get out and whatever, So what happened was that there was this huge influx of Vietnamese refugees and they were sent to marine camps dedicated marine camps throughout the United States and one of the big places they were set was Camp Pendleton, which is San Diego in Southern California. And the temple where I was living the international Buddhist meditation center was in LA And. It was really interesting to see the Marines in action. They realize that at least half of the People that were. Coming into that camp would be Buddhist the other half would be Catholic 'cause That's sort of the religious breakdown in the country. So they? They could handle the Catholic because that's international you just get Catholic priest. But they were smart enough to know that there were Buddhists. Buddhist clergy in the United States and they were smart enough to. In fact, now that they were Americans that had been trained in the Vietnamese stuff, so the US Marines contract it with the temple. Our temple. To hire Buddhist clergy. That would be there when those refugees arrived and they went out and they bought Buddha statues. And they had these tents set up. And it was there for these People that the night before it been hanging from the helicopters. They were that organized that was actually quite impressive. So what happened was that. We. A whole bunch of us went down. The morning after the thing of the people with the helicopters. We went down in a bus to Camp Pendleton. And we could see People coming in buses, the People we'd seen on the news the night before hanging from the helicopters were being bused into this. And. It was amazing to see the look on their face. When they saw Americans of all races in Vietnamese Buddhist robes. And able to chant and do the liturgy. In Vietnamese because well there's this expression to meet the Buddha in Hell. It's like for them. It's hell writes. The last thing in the world they would ever expect going to the United States on a military camp that the first thing they're going to see is native born Americans. That are. Capable of working within their tradition as Buddhist chaplains anyway. What was the reason I thought about this was. There were among those refugees a certain number of Buddhist monks as you might imagine they were going to get out of the country, if it was going to go communist. And. I notice that there was among all the Buddhist monks there. There was one that it was young, but no matter where you would see him he would always be surrounded by People. It was like a People magnet. And his English was pretty limited, but through a combination of his limited English, and writing in Chinese characters. 'cause I could write Chinese and he they learn how to monks in Vietnam were not right. Classical Chinese so through the limited English and US sort of writing back and forth with Chinese characters. I was able to talk to him. His name was dumb one. And I said it's like what's the deal. You know use People seem to relate to you very differently from any any of the other clergy. Buddhist clergy this year. They said well my teacher taught me loving kindness practice. From the very get go loving kindness is traditional version of the focus on positive feel so he was constantly from the time. He was just a little kid. He was trained to radiate this out and you could see the object if impact. It had on the People around him. So anyway, edit at an advanced level. It's not just going to be in your body.

There's no one to save that's the approach now part of me to you know that's my on a text the Mahayana critique of early Buddhism. And our words, they say, Well, there's 2 things wrong with early Buddhism. One is That. Although the practice of service may have been there, it was. Not philosophically emphasized so early Buddhism sounds like spiritual, selfish, hence the term. He now on our small vehicle and then the other thing they say that was wrong with early Buddhism is that they thought that what you get to know self buy. Teasing apart the Skanda's right, but you have to realize that. The thunders themselves are empty as is everything so it's not just that there's no thing called itself. There's no thing. And that's the shooting Nevada or teachings about emptiness so those 2 are Co arise that's like. We gotta save the world that really not there and sort of getting those 2 clearly that's the bodhichitta. After the night. Comes the dawn. It's a natural cycle. After the impersonal.

I will. First sort of ask them questions. I do my own little differential diagnosis, and try to determine if what they're going through is. 100% an artifact of the experience of emptiness through their practice or whether it's possible that there's just an element of regular. Old fashioned depression anxiety that's involved I'll try to make a guess. If I suspect that it's 100% based on practice, then I'll give my stand my standard treatment regimen for that which is Twofold. If the fact that everything is empty is freaking you out will clearly there's something that's not yet empty, which is your freak out, so use the momentum of emptiness to empty your freak out. That's Sort of the 1st element in the prescription and the 2nd element in the prescription is well good now. You're nothing whatsoever. And this will give us natural basis from which you can literally reconstruct a new and better self through focus on positive practice and I look upon myself in that case as. Something like a physical therapist that's going to have to constantly be prodding that person to do. The exercise that strengthens their atrophy aid human muscles, so to speak and we rebuild. Those muscles in a new and better way through focus assiduous and continuous focus on positive feel image talk so that's What I do if I suspect that it's really the classic dark night of the soul or the classic pit of the void that is described on one hand and the Christian and on the other hand in the Buddhist traditions, however. Usually that is not the case. Usually if a person is bummed out burned out freaking out and so forth their subject to. Unreasonable anxiety and unreasonable paralytic sadness and so forth. Usually that is actually the result of psychological. Elements So what I do is I never tell People that they should use psychotropic medications or anything like that often People will come to me. With that question should I go on Celexa Lexapro or what have you. I never tell People Oh yeah, I think you should? Do that because I'm not qualified to tell a person that. But if I suspect that they may have a clinical depression or an anxiety disorder of some sort In other words, If I suspect that it's not 100% based on their practice. An usually I do. That is the case. Usually, I suspect that there could be just a plain old psychological even clinical biochemical aspect here. If I suspect that that is possible. I strongly encourage People to go to a mental health professional and consider the possibility of standard treatments for these things which. At this point is usually medications. I don't advocate, the medications but I definitely advocate being open to the possibility that they may need them, and encourage them to find a competent expert who can give them a differential diagnosis based on Western Medison and if need be prescribed. The meds now a lot of times People think Oh well, I shouldn't take these medications because it covers over the stuff. I should just let it come up and deal with it well. Yeah, if you can productively deal with it. Sure, but remember the metaphor is exercise. It doesn't make any sense to attempt to bench press \u00a3200. The first day in the gym. You want to take manageable weights. If you have a clinical depression situation that is probably too much weight. To try to be lifting on your own, without some reduction in intensity do too. Through appropriate medication and anything that needs to come up will come up. I tell People that if you do have a clinical situation. You are already in a natural state. The meds will get you in some way closer to a natural state where it will be easier to do the meditative practice. Now it's true that psychotropic medications can have side effects. A person has to decide whether those side effects. Are worth the main effect? That's case by case person by person. But if they decide that the good effect is sufficient to justify the side effects, then I would say this. You can those side effects only come up in touch feel image talk. You can use the mindfulness practice very productively to work with those side effects to purify consciousness to gain insight to reduce the suffering that they cause and so forth.","title":"Classic 'Dark Night' or Clinical Issues"},{"location":"expandcontract/classical-enlightenment-healing-the-world-and-screw-ups/","text":"Oh, I think it would definitely heal the world.

But what can happen is that you, you can disconnect that's just be couple is just my geek way of saying disconnect. That can be a if you're let's say you're working in these site type system. It's possible that you could for a moment disk disconnect from that system. Either because you're About to go into reverie. Or you're getting sleepy. So for so that disconnect.

The way you detect that is by noticing that. For just a brief moment. Where you have been focusing on active states it's not gone restful because you disconnected and I sometimes? Sort of obscurely call that deep coupling because it's like in fit in like a magnetic fields. You know there will be a coupling and then they they just disconnect one of its own flux lines D couple.

Yeah, you were dropping now of course, you have an option if your D coupling and you're dropping into really deep restful states. Then you know, maybe it's time to focus on rest for awhile. Because you had a conscious drop out because you have the categories, the restful categories to work with. It was for a beginner meditator would have been a not out.

Explorer just the spontaneous presence of positive feel in your body which you didn't actually you were able to do that to a certain extent, but then it went away and it didn't come back, which is not uncommon. Finding positive field is only one way to go about the technique of working with positive field. Another thing that you can do is you can create intentionally create positive field and then focus on it, and one of the easiest ways to create positive field is too briefly intentionally make a positive thought. That's likely to make you happy or loving or joyous and so forth. Thought is something you have control over thought is your mental image in your internal talk or both at the same time, so you briefly sort of think thought that's likely to give you a pleasant field and it could be anything of your choice. And then You sort of drop that and you tune into how that pleasant feel may continue to resonate in your body even after you've dropped the thought. And then you focus in on it, the same way we focused in on the pleasant field. It was just there spontaneously. But in this case if the sort of resonance of positive feel goes away. Then you think you think the same thought or a different thought just briefly just enough. To get the body vibrating again with the momentum of pleasant field and I call that triggering the positive feel. Buy a brief intentional thought that makes sense is a concept, and you may have to make the intentional thought frequently or it may be that your body is emotionally very resonant. And so just like you think a positive thought and maybe for 30 seconds or 3 minutes. Your body continues to resonate and now you're focusing in on it with concentration and so forth and the metaphor that I use for that is if we imagine that your. Your emotional body Isabel so this is your emotional body Bell. And it's sort of passive. It just responds and this is your thought which you have control over. So if you briefly think a positive thought. That's going to resonate that that's like striking emotional body Bell and then you can tune into the residence for as long as it may last then strike again. If need be so we're going to do it for the fun of it with external sound. So I'm going to strike it and then I'd like you to listen to it until it's completely there's no more resonant resonance anymore. I'll do the same. But we could strike it again as need be so does that make sense very good so. Will call that triggering positive field but our focus isn't the thought our focus is still pure body were training your emotional circuits to strengthen the positive emotional muscles. So to speak. It's like physical therapy like a lot of People if they have. If they don't exercise muscles. They atrophy and then you have to give them physical therapy and then those muscles get strong so there's sort of like. Positive emotional circuitry within our brain. But if we don't exercise it. It might atrophy People that are depressed for example, or whatever and this exercise that I'm showing you is a sort of emotional physiotherapy. Its strength and see at refeeds circuits and gives you a tendency your body parts to your body at tendency to go to positive emotional experience as opposed to negative. So should I be trying to email, it different parts of my body, as a general principle. When you detect the pleasant field. With this technique, you try to intentionally spread your attention as broadly as you can within it. In fact, if possible. You try to experience it over your whole body. If possible, but you can't force that so however, wide it may be present in your body right left front back up down you sort of stretch your attention over it. And if it gets really strong. Which it will with practice it will fill your whole body? And then when it gets really strong it will seem to be larger than your body and like it's radiating out into all 6 directions and you sort of like this. It's sort of like this high wattage transmitter. And then you start walking through the world like that, and that. Has an influence that's an advanced level of the practice.

Yeah.","title":"Creating Positive Feel - 1 of 2 - Introduction"},{"location":"expandcontract/creating-positive-feel-2-of-2-a-guided-meditation/","text":"Let's explore it so once again take a moment to stretch up and settle in. And now this time. We're going to actively create positive field if possible, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't we'll just see. So I'd like you to think some thought. That's likely to produce a pleasant feel in your body. And then focus here on that. And it will either continue to resonate or it will. Dampen and I away. If that happens rethink either the same thought or a different one. And then drop the thought and focus on the pleasant residents in the body for as long or as short as it may last. That makes sense. Now, one thing that can help this. Is to intentionally smile just a little bit? Like to put the smile little hint of a smile. Notice how that produces pleasant feel. And that can fortify the process. Able to do that to a certain extent. Excellent. Let's stay with it for a few more minutes. Laughter counts as positive feeling. Let it spread as broadly as you can. Might might go out in your body. As you do this. Try to actually taste how it develops a concentrated state. You're very focused urine simiti you're in the zone. And your object of focus is this pleasant experience. And the more concentrated you become the more pleasant. It becomes motivating you to become even more one pointed. With this. Pleasant flavor that creates a positive feedback loop. That Revs up your Concentration power? That makes sense as a concept. Excellent. Now. Stay with that concentration in your pleasant emotional body. But open your eyes eyes open, but awareness back. Into the positive field. Good now make eye contact and see if you can set. It just keep some awareness during the social interaction takes a little bit of practice. So any final questions or comments. No. Well, I think this was an excellent session and. There's actually a lot more to say about the technique, but you can read about that at basic mindfulness data work. You can look. There's like a reference guide to all the different aspects. I just taught you some parts of it, but clearly you have enough to. To implement it and that's excellent thanks for helping out to make this video thank you. OK, it's a rap.","title":"Creating Positive Feel - 2 of 2 - A Guided Meditation"},{"location":"expandcontract/depth-breadth-of-concentration-part-1-of-3/","text":"I take concentration power to be one of the 3 core skills that constitutes mindful awareness. Probably my very first discovery that's sold me on the meditative Endeavour. Is I started at the end of an hour of meditation focus on breath I started to notice that I would go into these states of light concentration. But for me. It was a highly altered state since like most People I'd lived my life in a very scattered way I started to notice it at the end of period of breath, counting, which is what they gave me in the Zen Temple. That I would drop into these concentrated States and my teacher told me well. That's good. That's called some by Zalmay as the Japanese pronunciation of somebody that's good, but you now need to try to maintain that in all aspects of life as you go about daily life, I said how to do it and he said. Well, you start with simple things. The temple tasks that you have to do the washing the floor in the washing dishes breaking the sound those are pretty simple things. Just focus on that and then it will extend out to more and more complicated life activities and in fact, I found it was true. Over the years. That eventually became over the decades. It has developed in 2 directions. It's gotten deeper deeper deeper and it's gotten broader broader broader, meaning able to maintain it in more and more complex life situations. And as I said, I noticed it was intrinsically rewarding. There was just something it didn't matter what I was focusing on if I had a high concentration that in and of itself was a reward, it was. Maybe I should use the word but it was a high. That sounds sold me on this is like how cool is this, I could just do this. I'll never waste. Anytime again in my life. If I'm just sitting around waiting in a doctors office or something like that. I don't have to waste my time waiting for a plane I'll just like. Get into this concentrated state see all my life, I was afraid of being bored. I hated being bored. And I discovered then there wasn't any more boredom 'cause If you take something that's intrinsically boring and focus on it in very in somebody if you can taste the somebody if you can taste the concentration. As your as your focusing on this boring thing it's not boring anymore. It's intrinsically rewarding. So that's pretty cool and then I was able to appreciate whi in monasteries E and West. They give you such boring tasks to do the archetypal task for Catholic nuns would be stamping out communion wafers a whole lifetime. I'm just making communion wafers. I would suggest to you. That's either heaven or hell. Depending on how to use their term how recollected you can become as you do that task if you become highly focused on that task. It's more and more and more intrinsically interesting. I also discovered that. Not only does the highly focused 8 kerryon intrinsic reward? But it also reduces suffering. When they finally took me into the temple. They said that they would this was in Japan, they wouldn't let me come into the temple. But they wouldn't teach me any of the xinggan practices, the secret Bandar Eonic practices. But I could sit stick around and work in the temple and they gave me these simple tasks to do and I was like bored to death until somebody pointed out to me. While that same state that you get into when you do the breath meditation. You can do that get into that state when you do these boring test so that was like great, so I did these boring tests for about a year and started to discover they weren't as I said, I could be intrinsically fulfilled doing these very simple things. Then they finally said, OK, well, you know you, You seem to be serious about this you been sticking around and you memorize the whole liturgy on your own, which is as a foreigner is pretty impressive. You know you're able to memorize these long text since I know Japanese and you kept your nose clean, so OK. We're going to let you initiate you into these secret practices, but you're going to have to do it the old fashioned way. At this temple, we do it. The old fashioned way so I found out what the old fashioned way meant so it's 100 days in isolation. In winter. With essentially very little source of heat. I'm in a few charcoal briquettes while you're in your room, but you're mostly not in your room in the main Hall of the temple where there's no site. This source of heat and it's a Blizzard outside an you're doing. These contract rituals 3 times a day. But before each one you have to go to this frozen sister and break the ice bucket full of ice water take all your clothes off and Dallas yourself. But this freezing water then dry yourself with a towel. It's about 6 inches squared size that freezes in your hands as you're attempting to drive somebody actually like knocking the ice out of this thing, so it's like 3 rituals a day with this. Mizu Gordy Gordy and Japanese Miso means cold water. There's 2 words for water is not a single word for water in Japanese. If it's hot water is called you if it's cold water. It's called music. So and Corning means to purify too. Take away the impurities so this cold water purification going to have to do 3 cold water purification's everyday for 100 days. So. It's like Day #3. And something I had noticed was. That if I kept in a focus state. Well, I did this thing it was, it was bad. But it wasn't unbearably bad it was just like that. But if my attention was wandering it was unbearably pad. And it's like Day #3 and I had this epiphany. Is 97 more days and I see in front of me not a fork but a trichotomy? There's exactly 3 things are going to happen. Either I'm going to give up. Ah. Because I can't handle this. And return to the United States in deep disgrace. Or I'm going to suffer for the next 97 days abjectly. Or I'm going to. Stay in a state of somebody for the next 97 days to the best of my ability. And I didn't want to. Give up in deep disgrace. Anna sure didn't want to suffer objectively for 97 days. So I decided OK at least I know it reduces the suffering if I keep in a highly focused state so I'm just going to like I'm going to do my damnedest not to not to suffer not to suffer in the sense of well. I'm gonna have to go through this thing, but try to keep this focused as I can. So you might say that that was a giant biofeedback device. Negative biofeedback device go out of somebody you're miserable go back into somebody well, it simply is bearable.","title":"Depth & Breadth of Concentration - Part 1 of  3"},{"location":"expandcontract/depth-breadth-of-concentration-part-2-of-3/","text":"As I say this was one of the things that really sold me on the whole meditative Endeavour initially was wow. There's this taste. Of this concentrated state and I can see as I work on it, it deepens Anne. I'm able to maintain it in more and more complex situations and that always like working on things I'd always like developing things skills. Stuff like that, so it's like this is cool. I can develop this. It. Is intrinsically fulfilling? It makes uncomfortable experience is less problematic. And it's not all over the world. It's like really cool. I'm late to People from very different cultures from very different belief systems. But they shared this practice, they had a word for it. They understand doing the same thing they did. And that was sort of cool to feel connected in that sense to our worldwide phenomenon. May high except Mihai has. Been able to actually demonstrate with kredible research this intrinsic reward that goes with tasting high concentration and he coined a word for it is good news in this bad news. The good news is it's a great word that means the intrinsic reward that goes with high concentration. So that's the good news the bad news is Unfortunately it's the same word that I use for a different phenomenon, so that could cause some confusion for People working with in my system. Mihai wrote a book with the title So what was the what does he call it flow and if you talk about a flow state among People that are interested in consciousness or this kind of thing they'll they'll know that that refers to that now in my system. It refers to working with change and Energie and that kind of thing. Now there of course not entirely unrelated because, as you. Get more and more focused there's more more of a tendency to be aware of. How things change and the underlying energies and forces but conceptually in basic mindfulness and positive psychology flow refer to things that are distinct, but it's the same word. That's used in English. There is another term. That's commonly used in the athletic world for states of high concentration and you know what that term is zombie in the zone and so forth so there are colloquial words for this. In Ordinary, English because it's such an important phenomenon. Both in terms of. Sensory issues of being more fulfilled suffering less and in terms of object if performance abilities. It's an important notion so I think it's useful to create a? A definition of concentration power my definition of concentration power or just concentration for short. Is the ability to attend to what you consider to be relevant? At a given time. So notice what I said the ability to attend to what you consider to be relevant so you decide what's relevant cried at a given time? And what's relevant for you might not be relevant for some other person. Also at one time, something is relevant another time, some other thing is relevant. Often, in the definition of concentration there is a mention of restricting the intention. Narrowing the attention that's not in my definition of concentration. Certainly it's true that there are contracted flavors of concentration if you place your attention on the breath going in and out at your nostrils or the sensation of your abdomen rising and falling that's those are very small touch sensations. And if you hold your attention there that will you have now deemed that small sensation to be? What's relevant your attention wanders you bring it back, long as you bring it back. So yes, that is a contractive flavor of concentration. And there is a place for that. However, let's say that you were to intentionally create a positive image. At the very same time, intentionally create some internal talk that match that image. An talk that you repeated like a mantra over and over again. And at the same time were to generate positive emotional feeling related to that image. In that talk and you were do spread your awareness over all three of these sensory phenomenon simultaneously, and hold that. That would be a very expensive flavor of concentration would be filling your entire subjektive space with awareness, but that would develop the same flavor the same taste. As you would get by focusing in a very small part of your experience so my teachers, Sasaki Row. She says everybody thinks. That somebody means narrowing the focus but you have to understand there are 2 flavors of somebody contractive salati and expensive selecting your driving the car once by and large relevant is the touch sight sound touch, meaning the physical linkage with this car sites, meaning the sites of the road sounds. We need the sounds of the road what's largely relevant in driving the cars outside some? Which is actually a fairly broad focus? And once you understand this. You can drive in rush hour traffic. For 2 hours. Arrive at your destination. And you will be in the same state of deep repos as if you had. Had your awareness focused on the tip of your nose for 2 hours. In formal seated minute of practice. Without the attention away from it would be no less of a deeper experience even though it was. Very large and complex piece of the sensor event. Another misconception is that in order to develop concentration you're always going to be fighting with yourself. Because. Other things come up and you have to sort of push them away or push them down in order to hold onto the thing that you're concentrating on. I spent many, many years. Wrongly practicing concentration without realizing it. I was suddenly trying to suppress things I would decide what I wanted to focus on in my early period of practice that was typically the brow. I would be focusing on the breath. And then one other things, would come up without realizing it. I was suddenly tensing around them. I was suddenly trying to push them out of awareness. I was suddenly trying to push them down. I had this subliminal agenda. That was aversive to anything that was a distraction. And that creates tension and that dissipates energean that hurts it sort of comfortable. And what we want is that the concentration practice being positive feedback loop. The more focused you are the better you feel. And if you have these subtle tendencies. Or maybe not so subtle tendencies to be fighting with the things that aren't inside your focus or in some way like tensing around them, pushing them down. Not wanting them to be there that that makes it an uncomfortable experience to focus your literally fighting with yourself and you have to sort of be careful, and train train yourself to. Focus on what you do relevant without sort of rejecting all the other stuff.","title":"Depth & Breadth of Concentration - Part 2 of 3"},{"location":"expandcontract/depth-breadth-of-concentration-part-3-of-3/","text":"Another common misconception about concentration is that? It will always require a lot of effort. Now it is true that initially. When you attempt to develop concentration for attention, wanders you bring it back your attention wanders you bring it back. This does require a certain amount of effort. Initial. But it is not the case that it's always going to require that effort. A time comes when it's. Automatic. And no longer effortful. Yes, you have to be willing to invest a certain amount of effort and even after it becomes effortless. There may be times when you're facing sensory challenges when you have to effort again. But it's not the case that forever and ever and ever. It's this huge herculean orsus ipheion task that you're undertaking. You train yourself to be able to maintain profound concentration states while doing in very complex or chaotic environment and that's the dimension of growth of concentration that I referred to as it broadens it encompases more and more of life. So when I went into that 100 day training. I had. Could sometimes get a little bit of flavor of concentration through formal sitting counting the breath and I? Could I could get a little bit of concentration what I would do simple tasks. I came out to 100 days later and. I was not the same person I had been fundamentally re engineered. It was a very small price to pay you. I think 100 days. A big price is like a long time. That's a big deal. It's a very small price to pay to. For a new life essentially after that. That taste of concentration was always present for me 24/7. Now of course, as fun as it is to tell these horror stories or war stories about intense training in Asia. It's also sort of not a good thing to tell People why, why is this not a good thing to tell you? Because if that's what you have to go through to get this. I don't think I'm going to sign up in this lifetime. Natural reactions like what I'm going to torture myself with cold water for 100 days if I wanted to have perennial somebody. No, not necessary in Buddhism, they have this concept called Upaya or skillful means. You don't you don't have to rely on brute force methods. You can work smart and get the same results.

What does it mean to digest? What does it mean to incorporate with him if you look at the process of eating food and you look at the process of experience. It might seem that there's not much relationship between them, but. Think about what happens in order to in order to extract what is nutritive from food you have to break it down into its molecules and that's and you do that in various steps from coarser to finer to finer if you look. At what happens, I mean, the teeth do their thing and then the tongue does its thing in the saliva and then uh all the different juices and all the different processing stations just break the material down finer and finer and finer until it's fine enough so that what has nutritive value could be extracted and accrue to your enerji content. And since matter is enerji you can look upon it as you derive energy from the food either in the form of storing matter or in the form of energy that you use? And then the parts that. Have no place in your being. By the same process are excluded. Experience works, the same way. If you want to digest the world drink down the West River have a complete experience of. The moment In other words, or of the world because after all. A complete experience of the world is just a sequence of thousands and thousands of complete experiences of the moment. So if you want to have a complete experience of the world drink down the West River. Eat everything that can be eaten like the God Shiva, then you have to learn how to have a complete experience in the moment and that's the digestive process? When you are so engaged in any sensory experience that you have a complete experience. There's no time to fix site that experience into a thing the particles become waves. And. So the experience is digested into vibration undulation expansion contraction flow. The activity of impermanence and so it can be completely internalized completely made your own. Moment by moment if you digest the present eventually you will drink down the entire world and you will know that you have a very content. This is the way Sasaki Roshi talks. You'll have everything's your content now. Of course, you may not be able to have the kind of dramatic experiences that I'm describing right off the bat, but to whatever extent you bring concentration clarity and equanimity too. Moment by moment sensory experience to that extent, you are digesting it and in the most extreme point form. You literally digest it down into its vibra. Tori atoms and that causes emerging of inside and outside and that's why you don't just merge with Flowers and the Sky and the rivers you also merge with garbage cans and. Unpleasant People and whatever comes up in front of your eyes because if you have really good digestive Flowers. Then it all a cruise to nutrition. However. The peristalsis of impermanence doesn't just digest the experiences of the moment. It. Breaks up the Holdings from the past, the do, do the karmic residue. That's sort of stuck in the Karma Colon, you might say I know it's a gross metaphor. But actually maybe not such an inappropriate metaphor actually. The. Flow of impermanence. When turned to the outside world gives you a sense that you're digesting. The present moment, acquiring enerji empowerment richness from it, but when applied to the internal world as we sit and practice an in daily life stuff comes up. Are cage gets rattled? The stored pool of poison and pain within. Gets activated either due to its own rhythms for no particular reason or because something happens in the outside world that gets to us. This expression having your cage rattled. I think is a really good expression OK because it is our cage that holding from the past, is the prison. It's our cage and when an event in the present. Sort of bangs on it, we get our cage rattled when we get our cage rattled. It comes up in body experience and mental experience. Primarilly emotions or as I call it feel activity in the body and then mental image internal talk. Sometimes it comes up in a purely physical form in the body. If we bring concentration clarity and equanimity to that. A rising at the more it rattles, Arche Age, the more it seems to go to the depths of our being then the more will be digested as we bring concentration clarity and equanimity to those body and mind volcanoes. And in the extreme case. We actually digest it or re digested it wasn't the reason it's stuck there as it was never really digested in the 1st place so it sticks around. So if when it comes up, either as I save from its own rhythms or because it's been triggered by something from the outside if we? Have a complete experience of it. We will digest it release it and in the most extreme case it will it. The depths of the Holdings from the past will turn into vibration undulation expansion contraction Energi. And whatever. Nutritive value we can recycle from that, we will recycle into the energycap of our being and the rest just gets dissipated. It splashes ripples radiates and release is out of our being and that's the flow of impermanence as. Karma digester or purifer.","title":"Discrimination and Unification - Part 1 of 4"},{"location":"expandcontract/discrimination-and-unification-part-2-of-4/","text":"So there are many, many facets to the experience of flow. I use the use the word flow for any kind of change other than the abrupt vanishings have you worked with the experience of something vanishing as a special case of change that has a special significance because each time you notice something vanish for just a fraction of a second your attention is. Adverted turned towards. A place that's outside of place an outside of time. That instant of banishing turns you just instantaneously towards the unborn source. The place where a disappears. Too is exactly the place that gives birth to be in the next. Instead of experience so when I have you work with the theme of change or impermanence. You note vanishings and then all other kinds of change anything? I just use the word flow just have a nice name for it. So how can things flow? Well. It's nothing Mystical Mystical, something can get more intense or it can get less intense. If you ever notice something get more intense or less intense. You experience flow, as I've described a sensation could spread or it could collapse. Something could speed up your thoughts or a certain sensation someplace it's frequency could speed up. Or could slow down there could be inward pressures outward pressures. Even the scattering of your awareness, which is usually looked upon as a problem like I'm all over the place that could simply be looked upon as a kind of expensive flow. And the gripping and holding the obsessing the not being able to let go of something or something. Holding you so you can't get free from it. That certainly could be interpreted as a problem or it could be interpreted as simply a form of contractive flow and in that sense, not a problem. So as you're paying attention to the kinds of ordinary experiences that I just mentioned things get more intense lesson 10 speed up slow down spread collapse. There's inward pressure force outward pressure force. Scattering gripping as you're paying attention to that. You could notice that. All of the things that I've mentioned. Involve an interplay of contrasts. There's like OK could push out it can push in it can get more intensely can get less intense. So if we were to abstract from this situation we could say that. There's 2 basic principles underlying flow. A principle love increase a principle of decrease and there's many, many flavors and dimensions within which the increase, and decrease can express itself. And so we can give a general term to the principle of increase we could call it expansion if you wish. And then we can give a general term to the principle of decrease we can call it contraction. In between increase and decrease. Is a balance point that we could call 0 if we were using an additive metaphor? With regards to all of the different flavors that I mentioned. As you're paying attention to things speeding up slowing down getting more intense less intense, pushing out pulling in scattering gripping. You might get a sense that accompanying. Each one of these flavors of expansion and contraction. Is a sense that space itself? Is expanding the space of the experience is expanding or contracting? If as you're practicing that theme should come up. You pay attention to expansion contraction. It has many, many guises some of them not all that pleasant. But you might notice that there's always an increase in space. Actually, it's an increase in time. Space time space gets inflated when things intends to get inflated when things intensify when they speed up when there's outward pressure, etc, etc. Then space or time space tends to collapse, so you could tune into the. Space Nahs. Associated with the flow of expensive and contractive flavors and to the extent that you would tune into the space. Nousu are tuning tuning into the spacious nature of consciousness. This is a phrase that's used very much in the Zope champ tradition of Tibetan practice. They talk about spaciousness. Spaciousness is maybe not the best English word because it implies a pre existing solidified. Stage called space that somehow you're supposed to get in contact with. But I'm sure that that's not what that tradition is aiming at when they say spaciousness because that's just a solidified perception. Spaciousness is the. Ah, the space nature of experience when you have a complete experience. It's utterly rich, but utterly transparent, and so presents itself as space itself. Sasaki row sheet says you must reach the point in your practice where when you laugh space is laughing. And when you cry space is crying and it's very enigmatic. You can't guess what? Was he talking about, but then. In a few months or a few years or a few decades. You have this experience. Oh yeah of course, that would be the way to describe this so if you can. Fight long enough against Spaciness. The reward, you get is quote spaciousness, which is really space Nahs. It may seem bleak, but it's the rich incorporates the richness of everything within it.","title":"Discrimination and Unification - Part 2 of 4"},{"location":"expandcontract/discrimination-and-unification-part-3-of-4/","text":"As you are exploring experience what do we mean by experience? Physical body sensations. External sites external sounds emotional body sensations, mental image internal talk or various pleasant restful experiences such as relaxation mental. Quiet and so forth as you are exploring sensory experience, you could become aware of the presence of change. If you became aware of the presence of change, you might become aware of the presence of change. In various flavors. Vibration undulation, etc, etc. You might Further get a sense that all change could be looked upon as. In terms of pairs of contrasts. And there's many dimensions, many types of contrast. So I repeat it again more intense less intense speeds up slows down pressure pushes up pressure pulls in sensations or anything spreads collapses your attention is scattered in many directions your attention is gripped and held by one thing. These all can be looked upon as representations of expansion and contraction. Of course more than one can happen at the same time, you can you something can speed up and grip at the same time? OK, it's speeding up that's expansion. Gripping that's contraction something can spread and thin out at the same time, spreading that's expansion thinning out. That's contraction. So you can have just expensive flavors. Just contracted flavors and very frequently. You have both flavors at the same time, maybe in the same place maybe same time, but different plays. So it could happen as you're paying attention to experience that you become aware of change. It could happen that. You become aware of. How change can be looked upon in terms of various flavors of increase and decrease if so, if you become aware of change. Then you can explore the change if you become aware of change as. Fundamentally being based on different flavors of increase, and decrease then you can note the increase, and decrease as expansion contraction. And if both happened at the same time, you can say both and by increase or decrease affirmation negation, I mean? Along any of the dimensions that this can happen, speeding up slowing down OK should I go through the list again. Speeding up slowing down intensifying diminishing spreading collapsing outward pressure. Inward pressure scattering of your attention obsessing and gripping an fixation of your attention. Outward and inward pressure are usually in the body looked upon his problems. We tend to blame are self. I'm resisting something I'm somehow not letting things do what they need to do certainly scattering and obsessing of our attention is looked upon as a problem. But you don't have to look upon them as problems you can just look upon them as reflections of the cosmic Dow. Of the effortless. Iflex an reflux of nature. So. If you become aware of if you don't become aware of change fine, then make empowering distinctions. Just be you know bring concentration clarity and equanimity to the stability of your experience if you are aware of changing to want to explore. Generically then you can note flow gone. If the flow presents itself in a way where you can see. You can analyze it into 2 fundamental flavors that an at any given instant there. Maybe just expensive qualities. Just contractive qualities or both at the same time, then you can go to a version of focus on change where you explicitly note and surrender to the expansion contraction or bidirectional flow. So expansion contraction and both at the same time are so I look upon them as the fundamental flavors or a sort of fundamental way of looking upon all flow. When expansion and contraction disappear. Then there's 0. There's The One. There's the balance point, the still point. Except for the point that still point there would be no dance and there is only the dance. It's a great great phrase so expansion and contraction are the dance. The still point is where the dance comes from and where it goes to an what Peppers it at all times. Next step, it could happen, not necessarily not necessarily will or has to it could happen. That as you're paying attention to expansion and contraction. Once again to repeat some of the expansion and contraction may not be that pleasant. As you're paying attention to it, and yielding to it. It could happen that you notice that whenever there's anything expensive space grows with it. Whenever there's anything contractive space collapses. Then you could focus on the expansion and contraction of the pure spacious nature of consciousness. And that becomes an amazingly empowering and fulfilling experience, Essentia Lee, you get to feel the way the universe fields. I guess that's why some People call it cosmic consciousness. A further theme could present itself. Not only Do you have a sense? That this is a dance of pure space this meaning everything. The so called material world. That that is so called outside. The world of touch sight sound. And this so called inner world, the world of thought and emotion that reacts to it and says, I am. You say I am we say it is? And that's true from a certain perspective. But it is also true that. The I an the IT. R1 arabesque of flowing spacious Energi. From another perspective. It's the part wave particle duality is a beautiful metaphor for this. That we can derive from modern physics, yes, we can say there's an eye and it it. But we can also say that comes about. As an artifact of. Habits of consciousness. Specifically, lack of concentration clarity and equanimity. And if you have habitual concentration clarity and equanimity. You can tune into a different paradigm instead of the eye over here, always at the mercy of and it over there. And eternally separate like 2 ice cubes cubes of ice that. Can only bang together? There's the River called I and the River called it which will automatically become a single flow. Can't prevent them can't prevent the 2:00 waves from adding and can't make. The 2:00 Ice cubes. Merge. If you participate. Even at the level of a hint, but the sort of dramatic things that I'm describing maybe are not. Common experiences, but you may get a hint of what I'm talking about and even when you get a hint of it. That's highly significant for a human being. In any event by having enough experiences of self in World, as integrated wave. The I versus it paradigm actually goes away forever. It can never come back. The sense of self separate from the world. Most assuredly can come back. But if there's been enough, I experience. Then. You can never really go back to I it, you can only go back to what Martin Buber called I thou.","title":"Discrimination and Unification - Part 3 of 4"},{"location":"expandcontract/discrimination-and-unification-part-4-of-4/","text":"You're separate but not separate. Never completely separate 'cause. Neither I nor the Dow what you used to call the int the world, the other. Other pieces of matter other People and so forth. You see both the eye and the Dow coming from and returning to the same womb of zero moment by moment. And how 0 breaks apart and vibrates. Out and in. And for men's space into existence and then that space further vibrates. And begins to think and feel and. Either either. Things. I am a thing. And is vulnerable. Or thanks. I just came from the source. And is in some sense in vulnerable. The former case is what usually happens. The latter case is something called enlightenment. What we're talking about here is empowering? Unification. However, the way I'd like to look up on the path it's based on contrasts. Empowering contrasts. One of the contrast is between. Oneness. That is a healthy Oneness. And. Discrimination, which is a healthy discrimination. And we don't want to get one sided on one side or the other so. The kind of Oneness that I'm describing is does, I would say is desirable for humans. However, it's also desirable to make empowering discriminations. And to go back and forth. It's a dialectical process dialectical means back and forth. So you experience Oneness, but then you're not averse to making distinctions again a person that says Oh I only want to be in flow an emptiness. And I'm unwilling to track feel image talk as objects. I'm unwilling to track touch sight and sound as an object Oh that will Mayer me in self and Materi Ality. No tracking in those ways. That's making empowering distinctions that's making distinctions that allow you to untangle and be free. That's making distinctions that allow you to go from. Multiplicative overwhelm when things get. Uh. Tangled to additive manageability when things get. Teased apart. I like to think that there's this list of categories that contain all and only the most important empowering healthy distinctions that we need to make for psychological personal growth and for spiritual transpersonal growth. So we can distinguish. This. Visual on somatic versus visual versus auditory. Obviously, an within those we can distinguish. The more subjective somatic visual and auditory feel image talked the more object. If so somatic visual and auditory touch sight. Sound then corresponding to those 6 ordinary sensory experiences. We have to be willing to put taste into taste and smell and touch. That sort of covers ordinary sensory experiences. Then there's some special restful states, 6 corresponding to the 6:00 ordinary active states. And those are very useful to discriminate because they lead to very pleasant tranquil experiences. So those are discriminations. There are I think are very healthy. To be able to tease those things out. To be able to break the thinking process into visual versus auditory so thought becomes tangible and spatial and therefore trackable. And therefore tractable if you can keep track of it or you can train better. Still more accurately. Still, you train. The depths of your being to automatically keep track of these kinds of distinctions. Then they become tractable, meaning a source of fulfillment and not a source of suffering empowering healthy distinctions. Healthy Oneness. Back and forth, back and forth over and over again marks the path to Psycho spiritual super adulthood.","title":"Discrimination and Unification - Part 4 of 4"},{"location":"expandcontract/dissolution-bhanga-and-t-s-eliot/","text":"There is an experience that some People have in their spiritual path. That in the Pali language is called Ponge BHA NGA. Polly is an ancient Indian language. The one in which the earliest Buddhist writings are preserved. Hunger means dissolution. Literally and it's reported all over the world. It is by no means distinctive to Buddhist practice. In fact, it's pretty central to a lot of show monic. Paths in different tribal cultures, the dissolution or Bungay experience has 2 sides to it. On one hand it can be unbelievably blissful. Because your whole body dissolves into Champagne Bubbles is pleasant Vibra Tori, Enerji. They're not just your whole body your whole body in your whole mind. Or maybe even not just your body and your mind. But even your external senses of sight and sound all dissolved into a Champagne Enerji. It's like having a bubble bath. It's like being massage, dry by the Holy Spirit. It's like the cosmic parents are holding you embracing you stretching you and squeezing you and loving ways that totally fulfill you. That's the. Heavenly side too. The dissolution experience. Now, Having said that you might be saying, Gee I hope I get that someday well first of all. You don't have to have that kind of experience in order to gain insight in purification and Secondly there is another side. The side that is not heavenly. Decide that Hopefully will be purgatorial. And hopefully will not be hellish. Purgatory and hell are very different theologically speaking. Purgatory is a temporary place where you are purified consciousness is purified and every minute that you spend in Purgatory. Although it may be uncomfortable is a moment that takes you closer and closer to heaven. The beatific vision. Hell is a place of pointless suffering doesn't lead you anywhere purgatory definitely has a goal and there's a silver lining too. The cloud you might say. So. Sometimes the experience of dissolution can be purgatorial. It can seem as though you're being torn apart. You can be terrified. It can seem as though you have no firm ground to stand on and there are horrific painful mental images images of death and destruction. In classical shamanic cultures. This sometimes takes the form of animals eating you up the whole thing in some ways like being sick. Of the hellish sorry the rather the purgatorial side of dissolution and in fact, in traditional African cultures. This stage is often associated with actual physical illness from which the shaman recovers and then has knows their vocation as server of humanity. There is Exactly 4 possibilities. Some People do the path without any dissolution. Some People do the path with. The heavenly kind of dissolution. Some People do the path with the purgatorial kind of disillusioned and some People do the path. There's a mixture of the heavenly and the purgatory. My favorite poet is TS Eliot, he pulls no punches apparently for him. Abanga did not have much of the wistful aspect that I've described as I said it's different for different People and you have to just accept some People don't have dissolution experiences. Some People like blissful ones. Some People have horrific ones, and some People have a mixture of the 2:00 seems if we can if we just based on? What Elliot had to say that his was much more purgatorial in. Part of the four quartets, he compares. This. To being sick and he compares the action of the Trinity. To a surgeon that would be the sun and to a nurse that was the Holy Spirit and to the owner of the hospital. Just God, the father remember that, Elliot was a was a traditional. High church Anglican very conservative Christian. He thought of his job as not trying to convince people of Christianity through poetry. You didn't think that was the poets job the poets job. If there are Christian poet is to allow People to experience what it's like to be a Christian. Even if they may not be Christians. You can experience what it feels like to be a Christian. In his case a form of Catholic Christian Church of England. You can experience what it's like to be that even though you might not believe in that by reading his poetry and that's why I like. His poetry because, although I wouldn't say that I buy into the belief system of that path. I really appreciate that by reading him. I can experience what it's like to be somebody on that path so I'm going to read. For you, a little section how the Holy Spirit, which is the Christian term for the activity of impermanence how the Holy Spirit acts on you in order to rip apart. There's something is an innocence kill you. But kill you in the sense of. Dissolving the something Ness of self within you so that there's nothing in between you and the beatific vision which is their word for the direct experience of the source. The Woon did surgeon plies the steel that questions. The distempered part beneath the bleeding hands, we feel the sharp compassion of the healers art.

Spiritual scientist a great innovative spiritual scientist. Shall we say the Isaac Newton of spirituality. After Newton appeared in the world science really got going, Newton made some major innovations that. Set the course for science as we at least physical science as we now know it. The Buddha made a number of original discoveries that I think are as good as gold, they will. They will stand. The test of time in terms of the issue of ultimate human happiness and human spirituality? One of those discoveries was the principle of untangle and be free. Which I sometimes in a somewhat more politically incorrect phraseology like to describe as divide and conquer? Some People are they don't like that language, but divide and conquer means if you can break the complicated system into its natural components. You will conquer ignorance suffering and the screwed up behaviors that come from ignorance and suffering so divide and conquer actually is a nice phrase. But if you prefer the more gentle untangle and be free we can. Use that phraseology also. In traditional Buddhist scriptures early Buddhist Scriptures. The Pali Canon. There are actually a number of systems or schemes. For dividing and conquering the suffering self. One of them is the 5 aggregates scheme. The other one is another another one is the four foundations of mindfulness and another one is the 4 great elements. Earth water air and fire or wind and fire. These were looked upon in those days is sort of basic components of the world. I think it's important not to get fixated on a particular traditional classification scheme. But rather to generalize the book does discovery and realize that there are any number of ways of dividing the pie of. Self and so that you can apply this general or basic principle of untangle and be free. So the untangle and be free. Discovery basically says that when the elements that produce the sense of self. Are not distinct in awareness? They create qualitative and quantitative illusions that magnify the sense of suffering and that would be on the quantitative side and on the qualitative side, even more important actually produce an illusory quality within us that illusory quality is the perception. That there is a thing called a self inside us. So when you untangle the strands. Then the something. Ness of self goes away, which by the way freeze up the doing nosov personality. So you don't have to worry that you're going to lose something by untangling and being free. I use this classification system to apply the general principle of untangle and. Be free. I don't typically use the 5:00 aggregates of traditional Buddhism for a number of reasons, there a little bit hard for. A beginning meditator's to use practically fact I don't think I know of a single teacher that actually has People make the deconstruction of the self. The center of practice based on the 5:00 aggregates. Can generalize the concept of untangling the aggregates to untangling other types of components that are pretty closely related so we could say that. Ah, a core sense of subjective self arises in the field image talk system so I sometimes refer to that as the subject of self or the feeling thinking self. The thinking part is in the image and talk, the feel part is here in the body. So to the extent that you can track these in real time and keep them from tangling together to that extent. The subject itself will be a home not a prison. A little broader Formulation would be what I refer to as body mind self. In that formulation anything that happens in the body is a part of self and anything that happens in the mind is part of self so from that somewhat broader perspective. We have touch feel image talk. This is body and this is mind. So I have People learn how to track these 4 and separate them. When People work. Just with the course objectives selfie call that technique focus in 'cause, you're working with the innermost components. This is sort of my contemporary reworking of things like the four foundations of mindfulness or the 5:00 aggregates and so forth after one separates out these elements. What's next? Well, there's more to the deconstruction than simply the untangling of the strands? When then looks very carefully at each individual strand. And. A unifying principle arises so. Here we have distinction we distinguish subjective object versus object. If we distinguished somatic versus visual versus auditory. We distinguish ordinary versus restful. After you've teased out these sensory strands and look very carefully at them individually. You'll see that they're all made out of the same stuff. After productive kinds of discriminations are made further careful observation brings us to a productive unification. Turns out that all of these sensory experiences are appan very close investigation seemed to be made out of the same stuff except it's not stuff. It's a verb not a noun it's doing doing that could be described as. A vibrant vacuity. So the vacuity is a kind of transparency or. Refreshing nothingness and the vibrance is a kind of dynamic flow appan, which we ride and live our life in bouncy and Enthusia stick way.

It's good to be able to drop effort, also. The techniques I give you involve a certain amount of making decisions. Even moment by moment. When you're doing a noting if more than one phenomenon is available you have to sort of choose. And also you choose sort of what approaches you're working on. So it's also good to have a practice that involves no choices whatsoever. Not even a choice as to directing what's happening in attention. So some people call this choiceless awareness. Some people call it just sitting. Some people call it the great perfection in Tibetan, Dzogchen. Or the grand symbol in Sanskrit Mahamudra. There's different ways of describing it. I like to call it Do Nothing. That's just my name for it. So, there is a way to do nothing. A conceptual framework. Needless to say, because the verb do and nothing don't go together, there are some subtleties as to what this all refers to. The Do Nothing technique is designed with time . I cannot over emphasize that phrase. With time . Not when you practice it at a given occasion, but with time. It is designed to create a sensitivity for a certain circuit in human consciousness. The circuit that controls attention. And it sets up an environment where in that circuit will turn itself off for a while. If you try to turn it off, obviously, that's not going to exactly work, is it? Because you're trying to turn off... you have to keep it on in order to try to turn it off. The Do Nothing technique doesn't involve your hand turning off yourself. It sets up a situation where nature will grow that hand, reach around and turn off the robot/self for a brief period of time. At some point, you in the world will come back. So nothing bad at all will happen. You don't have to be afraid. So, that's one way to look at the Do Nothing technique. With time, it will set the stage. You'll develop a sensitivity for the part of you that controls attention and that's a very, very primitive part of our being. And then once that sensitivity is developed it will just... it will for periods of time turn off. A lot of people report, when I ask them about their experience in practice: \"Well, I can't decide what to do certain times.\" Like... just like confused with all the options. That's a really good experience. I know you think it's a bad experience, but actually that's a good experience, because when you sort of like: \"I don't know what to do with my meditation right now.\" The part that controls attention is maximally activated at that time. That's the thing that's going to turn off through the Do Nothing technique. But when it's maximally activated, it's good to know. Because that will give... that points you to... \"oh that's the place.\" Whatever place this sort of \"I don't know what to do, and I should be able to figure out what to do next.\" Whenever that confusion about what should I do with the practice arises, that's a strong arising from the place of choice. That's good. Because for a moment your attention is adverted to the place of choice. Love that. Maybe that wouldn't be a bad time to Do Nothing. The instruction set for how to Do Nothing is very short. Just two sentences. Let whatever happens, happen. As soon as you're aware of an intention to control your attention, drop that intention. So let's go through the inevitable subtleties, the inevitable confusions. There's nothing in this technique that says that you should maintain an intention to drop intentions. It says when you are aware of an intention to control your attention, drop that intention. You might think that the technique is saying moment by moment, monitor whether you have an intention or not, OK, and always maintain the intention to drop those intentions. Well, then you'd be doing two things instead of Doing Nothing. \"Let whatever happens, happen\" means whatever sensory experiences are going to happen, let them happen. Including that you may be very scattered. Maybe. That you may get sleepy and go unconscious. That you may get lost in monkey mind for long periods of time. That you will have very little concentration clarity or equanimity. Those are some of the things that could happen. They come under the phrase: \"Let whatever happens, happen.\" So there's nothing in this technique that says those things won't happen and they may be all that happens. However, it also says as soon as you're aware of the intention to control your attention, so if you have an intention to do something about anything that has happened, drop that intention. Inevitable question: \"What happens if I can't drop it?\" Well that goes to needing clarification about what drop means and what intention means. So the phraseology has been extremely carefully developed. Whenever you're aware of the intention to control your attention, drop that intention. We're going to define intention in a very specific way, and we're going to define drop in a very specific way. Intention is something that by definition, you have complete control over. You can initiate it or you can drop it. I have complete control over the movement of my arm. I can raise it and I can decide not to raise it. Drop does not mean \"get rid of\". It's in the moment. You drop the intention. The intention might come back immediately. That's fine. When it comes back, drop it again. If you can't drop it for even a second, then it's not fully free will. It's not full intention. So you don't have to drop it Anything that you might think is an intention to control your attention, that when you drop it, you simply can't. Then actually that's not free will. It's happening to you. And if you can't drop the intention. You don't have to drop it because the technique doesn't ask you to do that. And certainly the technique does not ask you to have a restful experience. Although, that could be a consequence of the technique and with time tends to be a consequence of the technique. If the experience is horribly agitating and uncomfortable there's absolutely no reason why you need continue with this technique at that time. The catch phrase that I use is if noting makes you racy, try Do Nothing. If Do Nothing makes you spacy, try Noting. Notice the phrase: \"as soon as you're aware of\". You may very seldom be aware of the intention to control your attention. That's perfectly OK. I didn't say you'd be aware of it very often. Specifically, you are not being asked to moment by moment monitor for the presence of that intention. You have to wait for the awareness to be there. Which might not be much of a wait or it might be a long wait while you're lost in reverie and sleepiness. Perfectly OK as far as this technique goes. This is \"Go Meh\". Last night, I gave a Tibetan word, \"Dak Meh\". I said Meh means without. Dak means self. \"Go\" is the Tibetan word for meditate. Gomeh means don't meditate. Of course, you are meditating though. The true Gomeh would be the state of 99.9% of human beings all the time right? They truly don't meditate. This is a form of meditation, but it's a sort of anti meditation, meditation. So as soon as you're aware of that intention ,then Drop it. Whenever that may be which may not be very often. There's no noting or labeling involved obviously. Common question: \"Well, what if I have the intention to move my body? \" Well. That's OK, I wouldn't always give into it. But your...what's your... Pinpointing with this technique is most specifically whatever it is within us that decides to initiate thoughts, attempts to suppress thoughts, attempts to direct thoughts, decides to pursue a thought once it arises or take it in some other direction once it arises or do... or use thought to do something about thought, that's sort of place within us, whatever that place is, is what this technique will pinpoint with time. There are automatic responses of concentration clarity and equanimity within meditators. You don't have to have an intention for those to occur. They occur automatically. You don't drop that. Because you'd actually have to have an intention to stop an automatic meditator's response. So you absolutely do not interfere with the momentum of concentration, clarity and equanimity that you've developed with the other techniques. In fact, that's sort of the whole idea. If there's any meditation that occurs, it's because, in this technique, it's because of all the meditation you've done before is meditating you. You're not meditating. So two things are meditating you. The momentum of your previous practice. and whatever you want to call it. The nature of nature. Spirit. Time. God. God's grace. Meh. Choose your words. I repeat, you're not meditating. But two things are meditating you. The momentum of what you've done previously. and whatever you want to call this other thing. Someday, we won't have to use this technique. We'll have a complete circuitry diagram of the human central nervous system. That will be extremely complex, to put it mildly. But we'll probably be able to point to that circuit and probably be able to from the outside, turn it off for a little while. Perhaps inducing at will experiences of freedom from limited identity.","title":"Do Nothing Meditation"},{"location":"expandcontract/do-you-think-sex-is-dirty/","text":"Do you think sex is dirty? I think it is. Actually, it's true. I do think that for most People, the experience of sex is dirty. That's not at all, however, to say that I think that the experience of sex is dirt. Those are completely different things. A window can be dirty. But that doesn't mean that the window is itself dirt. Dirty means that there's something covering something from the outside that's covering. The transparency that would be there otherwise. So for most People. There is craving and unconsciousness. Entering into their sexual experiences. And that could be called a kind of dirt. The term in Buddhism, and Polly would be agon to calculation are going to come in secondary or coming from the outside. Calesa means impurity not in the sense of. A urine pure 'cause you're a bad boy kind of impurity, but rather more impurity in the. Uh. In the sense of of. Mining engineering In other words, If you have an or with that, or can be mixed. Something other than that or you're going to have Golden there are impurities in the gold a refining process removes the impurity. So, in that metallurgical sense. Kilesa is an impurity consciousness is gold an there's this other stuff craving aversion and unconsciousness. That's mixed in with it. And causes our problems, so yes, there is this craving aversion and unconsciousness mixed into the sexual experience that covers over what otherwise would be transparent window to transcendence. So yes from that perspective we could say that for most People sex is dirty. Of the 3:00 craving aversion and unconsciousness in the sexual domain because of that's because it's primarily pleasure involved. It's the consciousness and the craving or grasping around the pleasure. That cause the obscuring of the clear window. If we Develop our mindfulness skills. To the point where we have enough momentum. Of concentration clarity and equanimity that momentum will automatically carry into the lovemaking situation. In which case. It will be less dirty and eventually not dirty at all. All the dirt will be cleaned away from the window and will be able to. Clearly understand. The jewel that has been sort of hidden in the pedal of. The petals of this. Beautiful Lotus. Nothing wrong with the petals of the Beautiful Lotus. But when you peel them back. You'll discover something extraordinary the jewel in the Lotus So what is the jewel in the Lotus? Well, it's the liberation potential. In the act of making love. And what is that liberation potential? It's a 2 levels. The first level is that the act of lovemaking can potentially become a pleasure meditation. Now pleasure meditationes, tricky deal. Pleasure meditation is meditation. It's not the same as pleasure indulgence, but what makes the experience of pleasure a meditative Endeavour. Well. As you're experiencing the pleasure. You taste the effect of your equanimity with that pleasure. And that effect is that the pleasure. Is providing you with? Greater and greater fulfillment. Seemingly paradoxically. As you become more and more detached from the pleasure as it's occuring. You don't have. Titan around its arising out of fear of being overwhelmed. You don't hold on to its passing out of fear of Los of something. When you stop tightening around pleasure in general. Out of fear of overwhelm. And stop holding on to it, it, it's trying to prevent its passing out of fear of laws. When you stop doing that, then the pleasures starts to deliver for you greater and greater satisfaction clearly this becomes most challenging when the pleasure is of the most intense type that the human nervous system can produce which typically happens in the lovemaking situation there. The fear of overwhelm is obviously great, so there tends to be a tightening around the arising of the pleasure. Also, the sense of Los when a wave of pleasure passes can be great, so there's a tightening around the passing of the pleasure if you can. Learn to experience the pleasure without the tightening on its arising or it's passing, then you start to experience something beyond pleasure, you experience fulfillment. At the most extreme level of that phenomenon. The pleasure hovers right at the boundary between existence and nonexistence. It's so much a wave you're so open to it that it's in a sense, not there, but it also is there. The Tibetan term for that is the Oneness of Bliss and void so. One level. At which the love, making the jewel in the Lotus reveals itself is in this. Complete experience of pleasure, which gives immense fulfillment transforms consciousness, but his paradoxical because it's both rich and empty at the at the same time. However, add an even deeper level. The jewel in the Lotus the spiritual potential in the act of making love. Arises from the fact that. The feel image talk self. Has a natural tendency to dissolve? Into flow. And even to vanish to disappear. Due to the Uh. Expansion of the pleasant touch. And the sight and sound of. Your partner. And that is a direct window. Into. An experience that actually. Happens naturally all the time in daily life. Just not quite so intensely. And if you can look through that window. See the dissolving of your field image talk self into flow. And then the disappearance of that flow into nothing whatsoever knows. You may be able in fact, you will. Eventually be able to remember what that experience is. And replicate it with the touch sight sound of everything in the world that is not to say that. All your daily experiences become eroticized. All your daily experiences become spiritualized. And.

That sermon was first delivered.","title":"Do You Think Sex is Dirty"},{"location":"expandcontract/dynamic-aspects-of-the-sensory-system/","text":"These are the 12 basic sensory experiences that I have People work with. 6 restful flavors relaxation light silence peace blank quiet and 6 ordinary flavors that correspond to those touch sight sound feel image talk.

Flow they could change they could be WAVY. Vibra Tori, Angela Tori. There could be spreading or collapsing. There could be inward or outward forces. Expansive forces contractive forces In other words inside the ordinary experiences of touch sight sound feel image talk and the restful experiences of relaxation light silence peace blind quiet. There could on occasion be a dynamic aspect. I like the word dynamic because dynamic if you look it up in the dictionary is defined as relating to change or the forces or energies that produce change. So when you're working with these sensory categories. It could happen that you become aware of the dynamic aspect being present in one or many of them, meaning you awareness is drawn to the fact that there's change or that there's enerji force within it. Energies an interesting word because until it was incorporated as a technical term in the vocabulary of physics. Not that long ago, maybe a couple 100 years ago. Until then, Enerji was a technical term in the vocabulary of Christian meditator's and it meant pretty much what I'm talking about awareness of the spirit moving through ones. Body mind and so forth and the world actually and breaking things up dissolving you reducing you in the sense of taking you back to the source. If the dynamic aspect presents itself in any of these states. I will have People if they wish focus on that, if it's a kind of continuous change. Then I refer to that as flow flow, as I say could happen in any of these. Another kind of changes the discontinuous change where something abruptly vanish is and I call that vanishing when People label. It they label gone. As you're working with ordinary a restful experience if flow or vanishing becomes evident and if you so desire you can focus on that and that will bring about a whole bunch of very interesting and important experiences that I describe my websites in an article on the significance of flow there's another article. Called return to the source where I talk about the significance of the abrupt banishing experiences that gives another theme, which is the dynamic aspect so People can focus on ordinary experience. They can focus on restful experience or if the dynamic aspect of nature presents itself within those experiences they can focus on that.","title":"Dynamic Aspects of the Sensory System"},{"location":"expandcontract/enlightenment-downsides/","text":"I sometimes like to somewhat jokingly say that there's no informed consent for enlightenment. People tend to overestimate or underestimate how wonderful the experience is. How wonderful is it? Well, I would say anyone who has entered into the world of? No self emptiness. And wisdom mind. Who abides in that world if you give them a choice to live one day knowing what they know? 4. Live an entire lifetime, but not be allowed to know that. I think I can't speak for everyone, but I would say most People. Who live in that world would rather say I'd rather have one day knowing? what I know than a lifetime? Not being able to know this so that's how wonderful it is on the other hand, People tend to overestimate how wonderful it is. People tend to project completely unrealistic fantasies really about Watt enlightened People enlightened People being of course, an entire range from initial stream entry to all the way up to. Our hearts People tend to overestimate. What it's like or project things that are completely unrealistic for example, that if you have some degree of enlightenment. You never make mistakes or that. Everything is perfect in your life or that everything is always bliss and wonderful and so forth. People don't realize there're certain peculiar. Downsides to enlightenment. For one thing. You. Can't describe it very well to other People. So it's like you know this secret lookout and you see the state of humanity. You know exactly what needs to be done. You know that what needs to be done is doable by anyone. And you see that People aren't doing it. Don't know whether to laugh or cry at the human condition. And you can't really explain it, very well to people I mean, you can try and a few People catch on. But it's sort of goes in one ear and out. The other for most People that you'll try to talk to about this so it's. It's like that character out of Greek mythology. I forgot her name. But the gods gave her this blessing that she could know the future but the? Flip side of that was that no one would believe her. So you sort of. Know exactly what needs to be done. And you know that it's doable. But no one believes you or not very many People believe you. So that's one of the Downsides. Another thing is that? You get to have all this. Influence let's say, but You don't get to take any credit for it. You don't even know what you're doing. It's like falling off a Cliff. Enlightenment is like free fall. It's like falling off a Cliff that never ends and you've acclimatized to it. That's why the Zen People say it's like writing an ox backwards. So you don't actually know what you're doing. Or even what you're saying when you give your most powerful teachings to People. You don't know what you're saying, you don't know even know who you are. You can't take any credit for it whatsoever. It just happens like a leaf falling from the tree. So it's not like you get to think of yourself as well. I'm this cool. Dude, that can do this cool stuff. It's not the way it works. So you can't even know or enjoy intersense you just have to occur.","title":"Enlightenment 'Downsides'"},{"location":"expandcontract/enlightenment-dp-dr-falling-into-the-pit-of-the-void/","text":"DPDR. It's an abbreviation for depersonalization derealization disorder. And it is a subject that I am very interested in. As a teacher of meditation. I sometimes refer to it as Enlightenment's evil twin. As the result of successful practice. With classic mindfulness. A person comes to an experience of the no thingness of themselves. And the no thingness of their world. And. That is for that person. The most fulfilling and empowering. Event of their life, it allows them to live. 10 times the size that they would have lived otherwise it frees them from fears and concerns it. It meaning the emptiness the nothingness of the paper thickness of the world and the nonexistence of self as thing. Those fulfill that person they give that person, a sense of. Of absolute freedom. They give that person, a sense of profound. Repose. And direct contact with their spiritual source. So it's A kind of rich and wonderful an empowering. Nothingness. The evil twin of that is DPDR. It's also an experience of the nothingness of self. And the Paper thinness and insubstantiality of what you formally thought was the world. However, the effect on the person that has this condition, and it by the way it is a recognized psychopathology. It's a diagnosis. It's In the manuals in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual. The effect of this experience of emptiness and nothingness on a person that has DPDR is the diametric opposite. It is the exact opposite of the effect of enlightenment. And it is possible that. The nothingness is the same nothingness. So then what's the difference? To me, this is a huge, huge question both both a theoretical question Anna practical question. The theoretical question asks us to look in a new way, and in a deeper way, at what enlightenment. Is? Why can? It be so empowering and fulfilling. The IT, meaning this nothingness for one person and have the opposite effect on another so that's sort of theoretical question and no one knows the answer to that there's also the practical question because. Every once in awhile. I want to be very clear in my use of language. Very very occasionally. It happens that People that are doing a meditative practice. Their experience moves in the direction of DPDR. Now, why I have to be very careful about saying that is, of course. People are afraid right because meditation is not something that's known to most People so it's like Oh my God. I don't think I want to try that if I could end up in the pit of the void and in this horrible knee. Holistic dysfunctional state so please listen carefully in my entire career of teaching which is. Long decades into my 4th decade. Now I have encountered this in students. Only a few times in the few times, I've encountered it with maybe 1:00 or 2:00 exceptions. I've been able to cure it. In other words through giving the right direction. It ended up eventually becoming the empowering an fulfilling experience. So the chances that you're going to develop this bad effect that I just described as the result of doing mindfulness. Under a competent guide the chances of that happening to you are very remote. I mean, yes, there's there's a non zero probability. But there's also a non zero probability that you're going to be killed in a terrorist attack in North America, but it's really not highly probable so this is not something to worry about from a practical point of view for someone. That's considering the meditative path. Assuming that they have a senior competent guide that has dealt with this problem successfully. And has some idea of how to work with it. Which I'll talk about in a moment? what I have never done is attempt to cure somebody that developed this condition spontaneously using mindfulness methods. I don't know if that's possible. I don't know enough about the nature of it In other words, most People that develop depersonalization derealization disorder do not develop it as the result of having done a meditative practice. It just happens to them. One day suddenly. The something is of the self is gone. And the world is paper, thin and everything that ever gave them meaning is now vanished and they flail for the rest of their lives trying to get back to normalcy unable apparently to do so from what I can tell. And I could be wrong about this and I sort of hope. I'm wrong about this. But I I have the impression that there's not a drug based or therapy based cure for this. It might be interesting to attempt a Homeo Pathic Cure. By that I mean to use the strategies that People like me use with meditators. When this happens, see if they work on the general population. I have no idea whether it would or not, although I've sometimes entertained the notion of I had another lifetime that I would work with some of these People and see if the methods that. Usually work on meditators would actually work on the non meditators, So what usually works for meditators if their practice starts to move in this direction. Which by the way is traditionally in Buddhism called falling into the pit of the void and can be found descriptions of it can be found in the classical Buddhist literature, including the Pali Canon well in any event what I usually do is 2 things. If the freaking out because of the emptiness. Then there's something that's not empty what's not empty is the freak out, so I have them see that their freak out reaction? Is itself empty so that's sort of negating the negative and then the other thing is systematically developed the positive so you just. Use your concentration skills and so forth to do a lot of creating of positive feel image talk and you basically. I actually put it in a positive frame work for them. I say OK good now you have nothing. An from that nothing. We have that's the ideal place to reconstruct a completely new self. You can still at will create positive feel image and talk and now like a physical therapist would exercise atrophy muscles an in a systematic way rebuild. That person's ability to move so I've sort of push them very much like a PT push them to develop positive field image talk. Over and over and over again until they literally build a new and indeed better self.","title":"Enlightenment, DP_DR & Falling Into the Pit of the Void"},{"location":"expandcontract/enlightenment-maps-and-models/","text":"Is there a best model or map for the various stages of the spiritual path including classical enlightenment and all of its?

Probably what comes to mind for most People when they consider looking at the various models Maps stages and so forth that have been developed in the past. Probably what comes to most people's mind is well, which one is the most complete which one is the deepest which one is really tells where it's at etc, etc. But for me. When I think about the various models Maps for stages of spiritual unfolding. The first thing that comes to my mind. Is? How? Poor they all are actually. None of them is really very good. Now you might think that that that is a very shocking thing and maybe that's a disturbing thing. To hear a teacher like myself say something like that. But actually I take this as a huge, huge positive. Let me repeat the disturbing shocking upsetting statement that none of the models and none of the paths is very good. Is for me a huge positive? I wonder if you can guess why. Can you guess? I think that. There is a lot. About enlightenment that is not normal. And is important. I think. That. No living teacher. Nose. Very much about enlightenment, even the deeply enlightened teachers and I think that no teacher of the past new very much about enlightenment. Perhaps. There may be. And probably is. Just a lot. That. Could not be known within the limited confines of? Prescientific cultures the prescientific viewer things. Now that we live in a scientific culture. We can start to. Look at the mentions of enlightenment that none of the Masters of the past, could have thought out. And I suspect, although I cannot know for sure. I can conjecture and I don't think it's an unreasonable conjecture. That we will discover radically. Innovative dimensions. Of enlightenment that. Are very, very important assuming there's no catastrophic collapse of human culture? For the next many centuries. I think it is. Highly probable. That a vastly improved. Science and technology of enlightenment will be discovered by humanity. So for now. Given that none of us teachers. Is very good? And that none of our Maps are very good. That may take a little bit of the pressure off of you in terms of finding the best teacher and the events map. The best of what's not very good. We have to be humble, about that. All of us teachers. No matter what their depth of personal enlightenment. Have to be very humble. In Science, This is how it works. You make a A theory and it has certain implications. You then do experiments or you observe and you see well. Did those things that this theory implied happen? If they didn't then you have to modify or reject the theory. Usually, it's not so much a rejecting as a improving process. A really good. Map. Of Enlightenment, Would make enlightenment? Readily available too. Great masses of human beings. Essentially anyone on the planet with informed consent. Who had an idea of what it was? Anne thought they wanted this should be able to have it if we had a vest map anifest technology. The fact that this doesn't happen. To me indicates that we've got a long way to go and that's a huge positive. Because if what someone in India discovered 2500 years ago is the last word. The best. And cannot be dramatically evolved from. Then. We're really screwed up. We're in bad shape. Now I know the Buddhist tradition says well it is the best. It's just that. The nature of our impurities is so deep and we have all this reincarnation and it takes the Brazilian lifetimes, etc, etc. I would say that could be the case, but to tell you the truth. I don't see any compelling evidence. But that is the case and my gut tells me as a modern person, a sceptical modern person my gut tells me. That. We can do a lot better. And my own teacher who is very traditional Sasaki Roshi has said that each generation of enlightened Masters must improve the work of the previous generation.

And, which also goes back to our show monic tribal ancestors. Is the notion? That you can purify consciousness by exposing yourself, too harsh ordeals. And that practice is called asceticism. We have the remnants of western asceticism embedded in the English language in certain idioms that we use. For example, to wear a hair shirt. Or to flagellate yourself, you've all heard these expressions. Well, these are actual practices that were, and actually harder still done within the Christian contemplative tradition. That's called asceticism ascetical practices. The idea being but that by exposing yourself to this discomfort that in some way this will purify away. Your sinfulness or reduce your original sin and therefore it get you closer to God. Similar practices. Exist in tribal cultures. And, yes, there's a notion that they can be purification. I suspect that the notion that these are purifications. Came about secondarily can't know for sure, but my conjecture would be that. Our ancestors. Originally expose themselves to these physical ordeals. Primarily in order to enter the realms of power where they would encounter spirits where they would attain healing powers, they would have visions OK, you can take workshops in shamanism. And it's like. You draw where you do these different things and it's like a 2. Two weekends and you did a seminar in shamanism and that's sort of like now. I know what shamanism's about when you do shamanism in traditional cultures. It usually involves hair, raising physical ordeals. That you know, most of you know about because we have connection with the native community here. You have to put yourself through things that you wouldn't think. Any I mean like? Throwing a little cold water over your body's is a joke compared to a Sundance. It was probably the case that People expose themselves to these. Ordeals in order to enter altered states enter the spirit realms and then I'm guessing they discovered that as they were doing this. They were changing as a person something about them was getting better. So our paradigm asceticism evolved. Where it's like OK? It's not just that exposing ourselves to these harsh sensations thrust us into the spirit realm. But it also purify czar consciousness all around the world, you can find ascetical practice is if you read. The standard histories of Buddhism, they will usually say that the produc rejected asceticism. However. I wouldn't exactly, say that. I would say rather than the put out refined asceticism. Conceptually and practically. Conceptually. In essence, he replaced the notion of. The more it hurts them or in purify's. With the notion of the more you bring equanimity to an experience. The more purification curves if it's an unpleasant experience that will purify consciousness in one way. If it's a pleasant experience, and you bring equanimity to it that will purify consciousness in another way. Related way but from a slightly different angle and if it's a neutral experience that you bring equanimity to it. That also purify's consciousness, even though it's a non valenced experience So what is equanimity. We can think of it as training our sense gates. Not to fight with themselves so if for example, just to give a specific example. If a sensation wants to arise and some point, the body may fight with its own sensation. But you can gradually train the body not to fight with its own sensations. As they arise. If the sensation is about to pass the body make hold on inappropriately long. You can, but you can train the body not to hold an inappropriately long to the sensations. It produces and the same is true for the other sensory. Modalities it's easiest to see in the body. But the same principles hold in visual experiences image site and an auditory experiences sound am Top. Internal Tom. You can think of equanimity as training, the sensory circuits to get out of their own way to not. Inappropriate to not fight against their own productions, but also to not. Inappropriately hold on to their own productions. So one way it's a little bit of an esoteric metaphor. But one way to think about equanimity is that it's a training of the sensory circuits. Out of their usual habit which is to be real pectic as soon as they start to move they coagulate. Training out of that happen into behaving like thixotropic substance is where the more you stir it the thinner. It gets and therefore the less resistance. It presents to change. As we bring equanimity to an uncomfortable experience number one that experience. Doesn't cause this much suffering and #2 that experience delivers a flavor of purification? So that it's possible to get something positive of taste of purification even inside discomfort. Now, what about the pleasant experiences more you bring equanimity to a pleasant experience, the more that experience. Produces a quality called fulfillment. Which is not the same as mere pleasure? Fulfillment is what we really want pleasures what we think we will. So as you bring equanimity to a pleasant experience, it delivers more fulfillment. And also. It delivers the same flavor of purification. So you can get the sense that you are purifying consciousness by bringing the equanimity, too pleasant or unpleasant.","title":"Equanimity and the Taste of Purification - Part 1 of 2"},{"location":"expandcontract/equanimity-and-the-taste-of-purification-part-2-of-2/","text":"The old.

That's purify conscious is but you could do just as well with pleasure. And if you look at the classic Buddhist texts with the longer discourses of the Buddha. He Essentia Lee describes going into altered blissful States and having equanimity with them. And that purifying consciousness through through the process of becoming having equanimity with these absorption's and then that taking you to something that is beyond Bliss. Beyond pleasure beyond all dualities, which is the absolute rest up Nirvana. So there's an actual description of working with a lot of descriptions actually of working with pleasant experiences. But with an emphasis on equanimity, they purify consciousness, they deeply fulfill an if they purify conscious. Profoundly enough blocks to Nirvana are worked through there are what time called the do. Tom does Witcher depending on how you want to count them 12 or 13 uncomfortable practices that the monks were allowed to do, but not required to do like like ya. For example, a person could take a vow. I'm not gonna sit always at night, not lay down that is a practice. But not not for one night, OK, a person could say I'm going to do this for the duration or for a week or something like that, and that's one of the 2 Tom 'cause That's the term that was for 4:00 allowed uncomfortable practices. But the Buddha didn't allow uncomfortable practices that would be harmful to your body or that would wipe you out, so badly that you. You weren't really doing practice anymore, you would just sit in. You know out of it. Equanimity is Another of the components that constitutes mindful awareness in the way that I like to think about mindful awareness.","title":"Equanimity and the Taste of Purification - Part 2 of 2"},{"location":"expandcontract/equanimity-intentional-and-just-noticing/","text":"You can intentionally bring equanimity to it. There are ways of doing that. However, I would say that in the end, the most significant learning about equanimity comes about by what you described initially which is it just sort of happens to you and you notice it and you notice it's effect. How can you bring equanimity to an experience well? You can try to physically relax, the body that tends to open the body and that tends to open consciousness. So if you can keep the body. Physically relaxed as various sensory phenomena are rising that's something that you can intentionally do that would tend to create equanimity. You can attempt to intentionally create talk that sort of welcomes whatever is coming up. Or you can attempt to sort of disregard talk that judges. Or sort of combined strategy replace judging talk. With. Accepting talk because we have a certain control over internal Top so you could use your control over talk and your control over the relaxation of the body to create equanimity to a certain extent, but there's only limited extent to which a person can do that and mostly just wait for it to happen. You drop into it, it's a numbers game. And then when you drop into it, you notice. It's happened and you notice the effect of it on your sense of. Happiness and that creates a positive conditioning loop. It's important to? Also understand that. If you can't have equanimity, meaning you can't control the tensing in your body and the judging in your mind. Then. Have equanimity with the non equanimity. Go to that and just observe and accept the tension and observe and accept the judgments. So that either you have equanimity or you have equanimity with your lack of equanimity, which is a second order equanimity. Would be my recommendations?","title":"Equanimity - Intentional and Just Noticing"},{"location":"expandcontract/evoking-and-working-through-challenging-material/","text":"Within the sort of standard methodology, it's what you say if stuff. Percolates up spontaneously that is negatives. From memories and so forth it can only come up as some combination of feeling which talk so you simply apply the focus in technique to it, you untangle the strands. You open up to them you give it permission to last as long or as short as it wants and that's as you say if that's unfinished business. Then this finishes the business, or at least is part of ongoing process that you know maybe. A year later, some more has to percolate up, but you're fostering the finishing finishing of the business, or another way to put it is that your. You're letting the ghosts out of the cellar and you know they dissipate and are gone. So typically. That's How one deals with negatives now when you say? Focus on negative OK that could have a different meaning because focus on positive means intentionally Holden radiate. The positive OK. So no there is no technique to intentionally Holden radiate. The negatives in my system so in that sense, yes, I apologize it's asymmetrical. There is something it's not really a focus on negative because you know focus on positive you're attempting to nurture positive content and there's no way we're going to nurture negative con content. However, there is something that People frequently ask about which is well do I have to wait for it to spontaneously arise? Can I evoke something that I know is problematic and then observed. Then apply the deconstruction of practice to it, the answer is yes, subject to a couple constraints. The first constraint is I would not make that the centerpiece of mindfulness practice because. Then you are doing psychotherapy, you're not doing mindfulness, but it's OK to do that on occasion. The second is to sort of know how to do it, so as to optimize. The mindfulness cathartic component by that I mean? If you consider. Why you have heard the expression like? What are some of the expressions like OK rattle your cage? Is when it's a negative or ring your Bell? When it's a positive OK So what does that mean? If you look at the act if the Bell stands for the sun's car as the storm materials. So you can with intentions strike that Bell by bringing up some feel image dog typically a negative. You know an issue so you, you strike the body mind Bell. Intentionally, but then it's like hands off, and you let it resonate and you observe. You don't strike it again until it completely dies down. And then you strike it again. At some point. You may find this happens. And that could be actually at the very beginning. In which case. You don't. Evoke that thing the idea is it needs to be something that will resonate on its own. Readily, after evoking freeing up all your enerji to now apply the technique to it. So you can't be constantly trying to beat it like strike it into existence and deconstruct it. But if you find a Bell that that resumes so you strike it and now? However, suddenly you can still detect it. As it damps. And then strike it again and for some time. At some point it. You can't evoke it anymore. You're done for that session. So I call that evoking and it's not a focus on negative, but it's a little related to what you broke brought uh.","title":"Evoking and Working Through Challenging Material"},{"location":"expandcontract/expansion-and-contraction-graduate-level-version-part-1/","text":"We've been. Talking about a number of themes. We talked about the theme of change impermanence. We also have been talking about the theme of that which represents no change. Could be described as the one or the zero depending on your? Tradition of practice. We talked about the parallel between one and 0. The one is. The balance point. Between stretch and squeeze. The 0 is the balance point between moving this way, and moving that way. The center of the coordinate grid. The origin, they play the same role. 0 is 2 addition. As the one is to multiplication. The point being that. We have Contrast ING activities, there is a way of multiplicatively affirming and negating their called stretch and squeeze. And there's a way of additively affirming and negating. Once called go this way. The other ones called go exactly the opposite direction and equal amount. The balance point is could be called 0 or could be called 1. At the still point of the turning world as TS Eliot put it. Neither movement from nor Twords. At the still point there, the dances. But do not call it fixity. Where past and future are gathered? We talked about. Movement. Change. Flow. And finishing In the way that I like to. Describe things my own technical vocabulary for describing experience any abrupt disappearance. I call Avanish Inge and when you label. The label for that is gone, something's gone any other aspect of change any increase decrease affirmation negation speeding up slowing down, spreading collapsing moving this way moving the opposite way. I refer to that all generically as flow just to have a general term for it. One might say that. There are 2 fundamental. Flavors of flow if we consider that any kind of movement would be molded by an interplay of opposites. the Greeks lacked both negative numbers and 0 China had negative numbers, but no 0. It was only the genius of ancient India. Their mental set. That. Could see that? You could have 0 as an authentic number. They called it Shou Nya. Or Shunyata, which literally means emptiness its cognate to the Greek word kennels KENOS, which means empty. It's a Greek cognate to the Sanskrit Word Junya 'cause. The cuss sound in Greek correspond to a share sound in Sanskrit. So shooting ya candles kenotic as an adjective, meaning relating to emptying out. Um. Describes what God had to do in order to Incarnate as Jesus. And it also describes what Christians were supposed to do. With themselves in order to experience Oneness with God. Empty out annihilate the something this within and that's called Kenotic, Christianity, Christianity, based on the notion of that Oneness Hypnosis, a union in Greek, a oneness with God comes about through and emptying of the something Ness of cell except the become God. There's tricky there's 2 words in Greek. That correspond to one word in Latin, the one word in Latin is deification. The 2 words in Greek are theosis and Apple theosis. We even have the word apotheosis, meaning the very embodiment of something apotheosis means to become God in the sense of like the emperors of the ancient world claimed they were gods. But theosis as a Christian term. Meant. 2. Uh. Experience 8. A direct. Participation. In the spiritual source, but they become one word in Greek in Latin deification. The subtle distinction is Lossed Shinya. Emptying out kenosis it's the same in the E in the same in the West. If you want to have a direct experience of that that balance point that nothing. That very rich nothing that very special nothing that is the source. Since that's the still point? How do you get to the stillpoint many possible ways actually? One of them paradoxically is to utterly surrender to the opposite of stillness. Which is the movement? And the flow. We can think of. Movement. As generated by a dialectical process of back and forth. I have mentioned a number of times in these talks. Things that my teacher, Sasaki Roshi Joshu Sasaki bro. She says you can look him up on the Internet. If you go to Mount Baldy, Zen Center website you can see pictures of him and. Find out about his teachings when I first translated for him even though I had very impressive background in Buddhist scholarship and many, many years of practice, I couldn't understand what he was talking about. I could mechanically translate it into English. But I made a lot of mistakes at the beginning in translating and. One of them I remember he said. CEO Jean to Shawnee your wife. Which literally means westerners? Our week in abstraction now I thought. You know. That Zen was against abstractions. So he must be pulling down Westerners so I mistranslated it as Westerners are too abstract. But actually that's not what he meant he meant they're not abstract enough. My preconceptions about what Zen was supposed to get in the way. What he was really saying? Is there not abstract enough? To see that a gazillion things that they think are completely different. Are actually reflections of exactly the same thing? And what are the gazillion things that they think are different? That are really reflections of the same thing and what is that one thing that they are reflections of?","title":"Expansion and Contraction - Graduate Level Version - Part 1"},{"location":"expandcontract/expansion-and-contraction-graduate-level-version-part-2/","text":"He runs through this list. Of things that some of them seem related and some of them seem like completely unrelated. To to each other, or to anything. You'll say. There is 0. But 0 is intrinsically unstable. Because zero consists of all positive and all negative. All taken together. And therefore inevitably zero breaks apart. And the positive. Only knows how to expand. And the negative only knows how to contract. Now by positive I mean? Life by negative. I mean death by positive. I mean, being by negative. I mean, non being by positive. I mean, future by negative.

Oh, and many says success failure affirmation negation praise blame. Can you see? What the teaching is what he's trying to point out to People? Maybe not weaken abstraction you're too caught up in the literal meanings of these words. Rather than the poetry. Then is a powerful poem. The person on the other hand, should be a carefully crafted essay then People don't say enough. We'll be passing the teachers say too much. But hopefully they'll be somewhere in between all these faulty teachings. Someone will get something of benefit. In between born in between. Boy is that an interesting theme. All of mathematics could in some way or much of mathematics could be described. As. The study of what is born in between? Were born in between? Our remote ancestors. 4 of us is born in between father Sky and mother Earth. E Asian flower arranging Japanese flower arranging is based on. There's a Sky principle and Earth principle and in between is the human principle. There's always those 3 levels represented in the Flowers. So we're born in between moment by moment. In between what might be called fundamental flow. If you want to get to the stillness the absolute stillness the still point of the turning world. Neither movement from North Taurids paradoxically. One way to get there, there must be many, many ways to get there. I would never say there's only one way to get there, but one way to get there. The way I'm familiar with is the paradoxical way. My utterly surrendering to movement from an movement towards. Or any antipodal. Pair of activities of nature. By utterly surrendering. To either one the other or preferably both at the same time, if you can the something nahs. Within is literally torn apart, Sasaki Roshi is very politically incorrect as a teacher. He says things and I have to translate them that. Uh offend People I'm in really offend People. And he's completely unapologetic. He says I know this might sound horrific but father and mother tear their baby apart. Etc, etc, etc in fact. He will also put it in the same thing in a more. Soothing metaphor. He says that when the child is born. So you have to understand what child is. What's the child in this case? Was it the physical baby? We yet, he's talking about that level. But. The child is this moment of consciousness. The self of the moment. We talked about all the different scales of self any of those cells. Can be? The child. It's born in between we don't notice that typically. But. If we did. If we realized if we saw how 0 has just come apart. And vibrated back and forth to mold feel image talk self in the touch sight sound surrounding seen in this moment, then we would know we would arise the baby. The child would arise as an enlightened self and it would know exactly what its job is. The more gentle metaphor. Is that the child the baby graciously gives back to father? What it got from father? And graciously gives back to mother what it got from other. And therefore the child as a thing disappears. In other words, in this present said. Now I'll put on the V plus and I had, and explain the poetry. Which maybe is bad but? That's what I'm going to do so all of the. Affirmations and negations the? Vibrations of Our senses. Involved in this present moment of perception. Can be analyzed? Into. Apart that. Affirms. And apart that negates their tangled together utterly and, if you allow everything that wants to push out. In your sensory experience to simultaneously push out. And everything that wants to pull in in your sensory experience to simultaneously pull in all the pushes become one giant. Effortless expansion of pure space and all the pools become one infinitesimal effortless contraction of fools of pure space, but sort of like electrolysis imagine like? Several 100 different tasting salts. But they all have positive and negative ions. You can't connect them across a potential by hooking up a battery. So all those taste will completely disappear. Well, but there will be. 3 tastes left. The taste of positive the taste of negative and the taste of 0. The taste of 0 is. Pervades the positive. Microscopic Lee is. An pervades the negative and surrounds the whole thing. We started early on talking about Manifesting, a complete self. This is the graduate level version. Of that concept.","title":"Expansion and Contraction - Graduate Level Version - Part 2"},{"location":"expandcontract/expansion-and-contraction-graduate-level-version-part-3/","text":"The idea. Of. Manifesting. Was described by some of the Neo Platonists as? The from the good to the good never leaving the good. And there's a metaphor of a fountain that gush is out. Gathers back at the same time. If you look at your central nervous system. The functional anatomy, there's something right in the center of your brain called the Corona Radiata. It. And it looks like a fountain. And this sensory fibers go up and the motor fibers come down roughly speaking. I suspect that this is not a coincidence, so from the good back to the good never leaving the good. You expand and contract simultaneously, but the entire thing is surrounded by zero. So, although there is contrast, there is no birth. Ironically, by utterly giving yourself to life and death. You abide in transcendence of life and death. You are literally born into the unborn. And just like someone who's born into life. Doesn't know the rules doesn't know the lay of the land. It takes many years for the no self the unborn to learn how to carry on all of the functions of the self self. There's some pictures called the Zen Oxherding Pictures that portray that on the metaphor of training and ox.

Utterly, giving yourself. To whatever wants to say, yes and whatever wants to say no. 2 utterly giving yourself to whatever pushes out and whatever pulls in. However, uncomfortable that may be for awhile. We get a little bit of the cosmic. Act affirmation and a little bit of the cosmic negation. Just a tiny little fraction of it. This is the way Sasaki Roshi teachers. So we give that tiny fraction back, too. The rest of the universe. The totality of expansion in the totality of contraction and then our tiny little bit. Merges with the totality. And there's no something nahs. To prevent Expansion and contraction from Reemerging. Coming back together into the one zero. And to experience this cycle over and over again as you look to the right look to the left talked to this person think about this do that plan dinner eat dinner? Make Love, Make arguments too. Not lose track that this is happening would be tantamount to what might be called Living Nirvana. I spoke about how flow can integrate. The mind and the body. I spoke about how flow can integrate. Inside and outside. But mind and body inside and outside. Can be integrated? In the sense of. Never disconnected from. The source the zero the balance point, the one nothing the. Fulfilling. Vacuity. It's this word Nirvana. We can't translate it into English, it means both cessation. And complete fulfillment. Because it's quenching. The fire is quenched the fire of suffering is quenched, but your thirst is quenched meaning. That you have. Fulfillment. And not just a little bit of fulfillment. But a kind of. Otter fulfillment for no reason whatsoever. Happiness independent of conditions Suki Hoto May, you be happy is the traditional greeting in Tera Vaada Buddhism. In the Pali language happy in the sense of good things happen to you. And happy in the sense that your happiness is not dependent on good things happening to you. Both of these connotations are present when. People say Suki Hoto. Ironically, bye bye. Being able to innocence abstract innocence see that. Um. All change. In this can be in some way looked upon as an interplay of oppositely directed doings. And then by seeing that they all boil down to young and Jen. Yes, and no life and death. Expansion and contraction. Moving forward moving backward, etc etc. You surrender the life and death. And you're torn apart. But don't worry. All that happens is you become life and death. This is I didn't make this phraseology out. This is verbatim, Sasaki Roche E Asia. He says I know it's scary to think of completely surrendering. 2 expansion and contraction. It's scary to think, to consider allowing yourself to literally be torn apart. By the forces of nature. But don't be scared. All that's going to happen is when you surrender to life and death you will become. Life and death, they will no longer be an object for you and therefore you will become free from life and death. You will become that which is beyond life and death because life and death will will re balance will reunite. Into the still point of the turning world. Neither life nor death. Neither movement from North towards this could also be described as absolute present. Future and past uniting. In an absolute presence that has no. Duration whatsoever.

And others of you will go through, but not everyone goes through it, it has both up. Eh. A wonderful aspect to it because there can be like Champagne Bubbles and Blissful flows of energy and so forth. That's the wonderful side, but there can also be disturbing images of skeletons a death and animals eating you up and if this sounds like some of the things that happen in traumatic culture. That's no coincidence. I'm sure that's no coincidence. This is a human thing it, Tran sends a particular. Spiritual path often in Africa. It's There's an illness associated with before a big spiritual breakthrough takes place in other cultures of the shaman experiences animals eating eating them, etc, etc. So there can be heavenly side in a hellish side, so for some People that's only heavenly everything just becomes an aerosol the most blissful gentle. Effervescent flow. And that's the form that the dissolution takes for other People, the flow is more like being torn apart. Like you just being pounded and squeezed and stretched and twisted the whole fabric of consciousness. And other People get these weird images and stuff like that. That sort of skeletons and rotting corpses. Things emblematic of death, which makes sense because you are after all, surrendering to the primordial forces of death, but also of life.

Life and Death God and the devil won't have anything in between them. To prevent them from uniting. Into that which transcends contrast, all ordinary taste disappear, and there is only the V Moksha Rasa. The taste of liberation. But according to the way my teacher likes to talk. There's really 3 tastes in there. The taste of life, the taste of death and the taste of 0. That that which is neither life nor death. But their completion. The integrated body mind and world. At arise never completely separate. From the source. Even as you're going about daily life looking here looking there. It seems like 0. Opens up expands and contracts and molds what you're looking at. But it never really separates from 0, so you what you're looking at. The forces that are molding you and what you're looking at. And the cessation of those forces. Are never completely separate that then sets the stage for a lifetime of integration? And since you experience. The self. And the world. As. Coming out of and returning to. The same place through the Paris Dalasis of this formless womb. In. Greek. You know what the word for brother or sister is it's unisex word actually means sibling brother or sister. I'll give you a hint there's a city that's called the city of brotherly slash sisterly love. Well, the love part is the Filia. Adelphos is the brother sister part. Delfos, although you would never guess by its sound. Is cognate to the sounds great word? Uh. Garpax. GARBHA I've never heard of that Atago to Garba. Garpax means woo? To target the garbage the womb of the book does. The mother of the put does the source the nature of nature delfos means womb? And so adelphos means one who shares the womb delfos. A brother or sisters someone who shares the womb literally. And in Sanskrit word is Scarpa. So adelphos they don't sound that similar, but they are cognates. Agaba one who is shared the room. Adelphos one who is shared the womb. So, your physical brother or sister is the one. Who has? A shared the physical world. But. The formless womb of the source. Everyone shares. And. To the extent that you? Have a sense of. Sharing that source. To that extent you?

Really detect expensive contractive movement force. It's not just OK if you focus on the breath. That's expansion and contraction. You have to detect those flavors in it, and I wouldn't want to only do it with the breath forever because the idea is you want to eventually be able to detect this in all sensory experiences all time, but the breath is a represent a representative of this. There's three ways you can do it, you can just focus on the volume metric expansion on the in and the volume metric collapse on the out breath. So that would be one way you're alternating expansion contraction in the sense of literally space getting larger or smaller. You can reverse it, though. When you breathe in the muscles. Contract and the linings of the bronchi and so forth sort of get field a tug inward, so remember I always say. Ink pressure or space or etc, etc or force right. So when you breathe in. There's actually a contractive force. That's detectable and when you breathe out that releases so there's an expensive force so that reverses the opposite polarity of the volumetric expansion and contraction. So one way you can work with breath expensive contractive. Wise is in breath is volumetric expansion out breath is volumetric contraction. Volume metric pardon my keys. It just means with respect to how big something is how you would measure the volume so you can expand on the end contract on the out or force. Wise you can contract on the end. And expand on the out or if you want to get fancy you can volumetrically expand annefors. Wise contract on the end and reverse that on the out. So you have a both on the end, both on the out. But. The roles of father and mother get reversed and secure Oh, she says. When father finds Mother's native village and mother finds father's native village, then father turns into mother and mother turns into father OK. They flip roles and that's the only way that they can come back, etc, etc. So where you've got whichever one you want to call the native village. But there's if you want to call the volume metric thing sort of like surface and then the other thing deep right. So you, your surface expands on the in breath. The depths contract on the in breath, but then on the out breath. They flip roles right the surface contracts, but the out the inside the muscle stretch so that's probably part of what he's talking about, but just a very small part. What I find is that by working with the breath that way which is readily available anybody can get almost anyone can get the volumetric expansion contraction. Most People can detect the muscles doing the opposite. I find that working that way. With the breath sort of Sensitizes to the detection of similar.

Went through experiences of flow that were not like a massage. They were more like a beating. Yes. I had sort of left spiritual practice for many years I've had bad experiences with other teachers. An I said no more teachers. No more gurus, no more techniques. I'm going to let life be my teacher and I had many friends at that time who were students of yours. And they were saying, very positive things about you and I said, Yeah, whatever, so I ended up coming up to one of your retreats in 2006. I had good experiences with you, you showed lots of techniques. You reactivated my desire to Meditate, an nothing particular happened on that retreat. I was getting used to the pain of sitting. For long periods of time I was practicing your techniques and then I went home and I thought home. That's all very interesting and that was a pleasant experience, in general. And then about 2 three weeks later. Something started to happen, something started to happen in my solar plexus area where there were ways and impulses an knowing sensations. An incredible terrors and I started reliving. Terrors from my childhood and I started. Having very chaotic feeling but I felt like I was just. Going crazy. Friends said that I should call you, you were able to walk me through it, and ask specific questions. And we were able to isolate the sensations, and you actually said that this was a positive experience. And it was a type of purification and it was a type of dissolution and I gave you the pollywood you got. You said that pleased my ego, a little bit that gave me some pleasant feel Oh, I guess something good is happening. But the experience itself was still so frightening to me because it was so, so disorienting. Description I have now is like there's like a jazz drummer on speed. Living in my Taurus am going and it felt like a Jim Carrey movie where there was like Paul pounding and twisting and morphing and tingling and just completely incoherent thoughts terrors. Even things didn't look familiar anymore. I kind of have to keep looking at my hands and I say, These are my hands where am I and I would actually hide in my apartment at home because I was so frightened. And we spent a fair bit of time together an you said that this was an experience of. The dissolving of an old self. I've heard People talk about it before and it's always different when it happens to you personally. My standard phrases. You read the book now you're going to have to live the movie. Ann. And so many so many things about the spiritual path that I had read about started happening after that, and I would never have imagined. What the experience of that was you know from the inside it's so different that when you read about it and then it starts happening it was frightening. It really was frightening. And it was very disorienting and it's been. Almost 3 years since that's happened that still comes in goals and it's now a bit. I'm a bit more familiar with it just a just a few hours ago on the retreat I had another. Hum. Wave of it. Where I was having like these very? Primordial terror thoughts like a frightened animal feeling. Like something was a matter of life and death. I felt things being ripped apart. It felt like my heart was being ripped open. It just felt like this. This ripping. Experience and how did you work with that in terms of well, Luckily do the? Love it to death, it was actually too frightening to even bring that in at certain times. I just I just did the focus on flow. Which is a little more hands-on today little more hands off? And I knew I was saying so, you just noted it as flow harsh flow, but still flows very again. The Jazz Drummer. That was hitting every drum all at once and I specifically remember a few. Images image and feel combos that literally. I thought I was going to die. An insight space collapsed, I just completely collapsed into raw image field and then. Let go. And. Yeah, do you remember when you 1st called me the? Conceptual model that I gave you for banca. The way I talk to you about how it's described in the tradition. It could be very just purely blissful. It's all champagne bubbles and massage. I mean earlier you were describing this day with full massage. There is that component, yeah, so that for some People it's only bliss it. The whole way. And the dissolution process just sort of. Gently and blissfully dissolve them like an alka seltzer tablet into the source. So for some People it's like just Bliss City. It's pleasant Vibra Tori, and Angela Tori, flow in the body and mind is pretty. Restful for other People. It's at the other extreme. It's like nothing but the horrific the flow patterns are harsh and jarring and tortuous. The. Mental pictures are archetypal and horrific monsters images of death animals eating you up that's exactly what I went through. I went to a Goenka Retreat, 2 years ago in India. And the meditations were horrific I was an insect being eaten by another insect actually saw that enable I saw this big mouth. Come and crush me consume me because the skeletons of and then I was some animal running for its very life. And this other animal grab. Debian just started ripping my flexion interesting Lee. This this bunga thing is not limited to Buddhist practice. I just described all over the world, but specifically in shamanic traditions. All over the world and pre literate cultures. It is not uncommon for the Shamans. Report animals have to eat them up. Monsters get them, they see their own death. They see the death of all everyone in the world. You know this kind of thing, so there's there can be these horrific images uncomfortable touch and feel and jarring tearing energies and then what happened in talk space did you get irrational? Talk going on or what sorts of talk would come up. It felt like all the cylinders were firing. It was mostly chaotic feel for me horrible shame and guilt. I felt like I should be. I should be caught and taken in front of a firing squad and killed like right away. and I would come out of meditation and I would and I would be waiting for someone to torture me and kill me. So that's the horrific side apartment so for some People it's only blissful that they never get any of that stuff for other People. It's mostly horrific. For other People, it's a mixture both as both sides to it. And then actually there's the 4th possibility. Not everyone on a spiritual path or path to enlightenment passes through a dissolution experience. It's not a requirement. Many People do, but not inevitably or it may be so mild that you don't really even think of it in terms of a dissolution.","title":"Experiences of the Dissolution (Bhanga) Process - Part 1 of 3"},{"location":"expandcontract/experiences-of-the-dissolution-bhanga-process-part-2-of-3/","text":"If you think of the spiritual journey as a journey from surface to source. In making that journey some People will have blissful dissolution that they just sort of dissolved back into the flow and go of the source. Some People have these horrific dissolutions that if they can stay with it, then become blissful. Eventually, just purely blissful. Some People get a sort of a mixture of both in summer not particularly aware of going through a dissolution process so it's not required. You know, I do talk about these things that other teachers talk about them. Because we want to give you the heads up just in case it happens to you. Basically, you need to know two things. Why is this happening and what are we going to do about it so we do talk about it? The advantage is that then if it does happen. You know why it's happening and what to do about it, but the disadvantages. If we talk about it. Some People listening will say that hasn't happened to me yet. So I must be the child of a lesser God. I'm not really making out the rest goes or not missing not always is. Rough is you had People think well, you know, I have an experience that so I must not be making progress that there's that problem and then other People think Oh my God. I hope that doesn't happen to meet so there's that problem and then other People are thinking wow. I wish that would happen to me. There are problems involved in explicitly talking about these phenomenon. Scares People where it creates craving or comparison mind. But I think it's still more talking definitely get it out definitely. Because uh I think if you wouldn't have been there, I would have ground for psychiatric help. And that could have had tragic consequences because they may not have understood that there's actually something called the spiritual emergence network. You know about this that was created because they realized People were having spiritual experiences didn't have someone to talk too. They go into the mental health system while those mental health professionals. In prior times didn't know about this stuff and the spiritual emergence network is was designed to inform mental health professionals that Hey. You know just because somebody reporting the kind of things going reporting doesn't necessarily mean they're losing their marbles and they necessarily need to be put in chemical restraint. I can see the importance about you know, there could have been horrific consequences or tragic consequences if you had gotten somebody that didn't. Understand the difference between dissolution and insanity. I would say the single most important thing if a person goes through an experience like this is you gotta have somebody to talk too? Who's actually themselves been through it. I made it through to the other end. That's like. That's The Cure. More than anything, it's like OK. Fine somebody who's actually experienced. This then they'll take you through it is not what I said, I would do more or less. Through it onto I never really had a little recurrence taken on a different texture that initial destabilization. Up. Is still going on on different? In different areas in my life, but your acclimatized well every time you acclimatize to something or some fixed reference point. That seems to the carpet gets pulled out its Zen master rinse I talked about. Finding that true person within you who has no fixed position will wait general that's all down toes are great words and bread. The 100 spiritual books that thought wow. I'd like to be free. I want to find that true person within reason has no fixed position. Be careful what you pray for absolutely because it's not like I have ever imagined. There is no informed consent. To Enlightenment, Yeah, it's both not as good as and much better than you fantasized and I realized for Year realized that for most of my life, my spiritual model was wrong. In that I was a person and ego that was going to have more awareness that I was going to make a better me a new improved me with more consciousness. We're going to Polish, it break into a mirror. I was going to be a better new improved version of myself. And instead I discovered that you're a break that gets into a trillion pieces and vaporized and and what I realized is that? It's not that some kind of perfection gets added to me. I get erased I get erased and the perfection that was always there becomes clear and starts to shine. That's called a figure ground reversal and that's wisdom that speaking through you now to say those words exactly how it works. I would never have guessed it from reading the books can you repeat that I interrupted you that was really good no it's just what you said. You you thought it looked why I almost thought spirituality was adding something becoming bigger and bigger, more consciousness more power more clarity more focused more success in my life. And then I realized that. What spirituality is about is not having a self that has that at all and that those powerful qualities are just always, there in creation all the time when you step out of the way. And the price for that is everything as TS Eliot said everything you ever believed in everything you ever thought you were it's a very, very humbling experience. But I wouldn't give it up for for anything at this point. I want to thank you. For. For kicking me into this place for Jump starting.

How how suffering is created by the free cab by the spasm by the fit space fit fit the fit fit exactly exactly and that's That feel image talk, the does spasm doesn't, it, you like a spasm of the body. But it's subjective space and you become a hard as a rock and you become a terrified thing. And you create you create. You create yourself that's how you in my mind become a billiard ball and how the situation becomes a billiard ball in your just frozen you see that happening everywhere how we relate to the world and the practice let you go from the particular paradigm to the wave. Should we do so take a moment to lengthen your spine and let your full body settle? Which is just our old friend physical relaxation? And, which you say at this time in your body and or mine that there's Any of that flow going on or think this thing are things pretty triangle. There's there's quite a lot of flow going on. Is it in the body or mind also? Asked in the body or mind also it's. It's in the body. Uh. By mind I mean image talk space image talk space. This was always the interesting thing about flow. Because. There can be for example of vibrational. Hum in my body. I feel it in touch space. I feel it in in and out in field space. I feel it in talk space. I feel it in sound space external sound external sound space and image space also and sometimes. If the vibration gets strong enough and is often connected to my heartbeat syncopated with my heartbeat. It actually modulate side space external external sales. You get it in internal image also that I've got the screen vibration on that thanks so much actually about waving is not so much. The body is waiting big time. But how about the images do they melt in more mental pictures, not many mental pictures. You don't get so it's not much in image space. But it's in the other modalities that almost all of almost all the others how about right now is it is the vibra. Tori flavor of flow present in most of those modalities is. Here's what I'd like you to do. I'd like you to moment by moment note flow. And we're going to tune into that, but each time you note flow. I'd like you to spread your awareness do the zoom out option spread your awareness is broadly as you can through body mind and even external world to sort of do a coverage moment by moment zooming out does that make sense. You understand what I'm talking about yes and I'd like you to begin by using spoken labels. Note flow say the word out loud to use the tone of voice and the pacing for the equanimity in the concentration. Flow. Flow. Flow. That's perfect I can tell by the tone of voice that you're in deep equanimity and I can tell by the pacing that your concentration is good is that correct. Yes, good now go to the standard optional labeling either speak the labels out loud or make the mental or no label at all. Sort of shifting like years. Whatever works best for you. And. Zoom out each time to cover the flow, as broadly as it may be present in your sensory experience and let it sort of unify and integrate body mind, maybe body mind and world. How does that instruction makes sense yes it did? And we'll just see what happens, I'll just do my own practice while you do. That topic along OK. Very much OK. What's OK or good about it? I don't know. Stay with it as you speak see if you want to speak slowly. That's OK. So to stay with it as you as you describe it. In this particular instance. It's become more focused in hide, and then I. Have experienced before perhaps it's Guidance or Something but when I say flow. It's just. A unified field of Softap Pleasant waves. And almost every sense except. Image that's fine and uh and of course, my eyes are closed. So where did tend to affect site space if you open your eyes? Why don't you do that see what happens D focus your eyes just let light in? See if it affects visual with your eyes open may or may not. When I label flow and penetrate with eyes open, I moved from site to light. Yes, that's good. Do that just relate to it as line. Now I'd like you to go back to the practice that you're doing, noting flow zooming out the awareness. And it you can cover. The light coming in from the outside World, as part of the flow. Materi ality of the world is now breaking up along with the. Carnality of your body and the something this of your mind. And just sort of stay with that for a little while. How's it coming? Very nicely. And is there going to up the challenge level. I'd like you to see if you can keep some contact with that. And make eye contact. What I was going to say? Excellent. Able to do that a little bit. Not sure. So. This is what you can do. Your little gift to the world. Any questions about that. OK. Wow. Yeah, yeah. OK. No, I think we're done.","title":"Experiences of the Dissolution (Bhanga) Process - Part 3 of 3"},{"location":"expandcontract/finding-positive-feel/","text":"I'd like you to take a moment to stretch your spine up and then let your whole body settle. Sort of relax for a moment into the posture. And tune into With the pleasantness of the body being still and reposed. Now sometimes. There can be pleasant, emotional sensation. Let's just there in your body maybe for no particular reason. Like there's an interest or pleasant excitement. Or kind of Smiley Nassor Rosiness or something like that. I'd like you to go in. Into your bodily experience. And see if it this time. If there's anything that's sort of. Pleasant. Sensation that could be considered an emotion like interest. Enthusiasm joy smile that kind of thing there may or may not be either is fine just sort of take a look for a moment. Sometimes just having a conversation and sort of fun right is smile and so forth so it makes a kind of. Interested juice and body. And would you say there's anything like that at this time? Yeah, as soon as you say smile or joy, just sort of there just saying the word good? I would like you to tune into that Smiley joyous flavor as broadly as its present in the body. And any other pleasant thing, including laughter. Humor. Anything that's Emotional in pleasant. And sort of see how broadly it's present in your body. And sort of cover it with awareness. And focus all your attention on that. If it completely evaporates that's OK. But as long as it's there just focus in on it. And if anything else pulls your attention away. Gently return. To finding Positive feel in your body? Does that instruction makes sense? So what if it just goes away. If it goes away and doesn't come back. I'd like you to tell me. And then we'll take it from there. So what if it just sort of settles into calmness. Meaning it sort of went away is that correct yes. There's nowhere does that count as another part OK excellent question, if it settles into calmness. It means that there's actually no pleasant sensation there for a moment. Will call that a form of emotional relaxation. However, you can open your eyes if you want for a second now you feel pleasant like were smiling right. It's sort of fun talking whatever but now you're aware of it in your body right when it hits on your face 'cause. We've been working with it. The approach that we're using right now is what I call finding positive feel in the party In other words, you just look and see if it's there. Without an agenda it's either there. It's not if it is there, then you focus on it with all your attention. And then if it goes away for just a moment, then OK. Be aware that there's kind of emotional piece. You're emotionally relaxed and then either you'll find yourself, smiling again because of that. And you sort of get into a cycle of emotional relaxation, creating joy OK and then that sort of going into this peaceful state and then creating joy so you might get into a cycle like that. The other thing that might happen, though, is the pleasant feel might go away and not come back finding positive feel in the body is just one strategy for the whole positive technique. There's lots of other things we can do we can create it? In addition to finding it so I'm going to take you through a whole systematic procedure with start with like you're smiling now. Hey, you can find the pleasant feel right now, it's spreading OK totally open to it. Spirits your whole body and I have a question when you say it disappears for a moment or settles down to emotional calmness? Is? Isn't that also associated with positive iti like if well OK excellent question? It is true that in ordinary colloquial English positive can mean anything, it can mean huge range of things. It could restful states could be positive or energy flow and some People who call that positive so in ordinary colloquial English, the word positive has a broad meaning in this particular system will only use positive in a very special restricted way it will be either image talk or feel. That in some way is positive for you so you don't feel restful not strictly speaking within this system, OK, you're aware of body rest. But we restrict the word feel or feeling to refer to emotional sensations, which if their pleasant will call them positive feel this, once again is just a matter of convention in language, however, being very clear. Within a certain system with regards to what words mean? Requires a little bit of investment initially and may seem a little artificial and perhaps even a little bit fussy. But in the end. It really pays off because will know exactly what we're talking about so once again take a moment to stretch up. Settle in. And now bring your attention to your emotional body. And it's possible. For some reason, maybe the circumstance or what have you that. There's some interest joy. Smiley humorous whatever. Even if it's just because I said the words. If so, To an end of that and zoom out sort of cover it as broadly as it may be present. If it completely vanish is fine. If it comes back. Focus on it. And if it doesn't come back that's fine, too. Then let me know, and we'll explore something else. OK, it's gone. Pick up.","title":"Finding Positive Feel"},{"location":"expandcontract/five-aspects-of-the-five-ways-1-of-4/","text":"When I think of each of those five ways. I sort of think of. Each one is having 5 aspects to it. If you think about each of the approaches focus in. Are you working with your subject of experience feel image dog focus out? Where you're working with your object of experienced outside sound focus on rest or you're working with restful states focus on change because I'm positive if you analyze each one you could see how in specific, they develop these 3 core mindfulness skills. So on one hand, there's sort of like generic exercise equipment and you can use them as you would exercise equipment. If you think of Jim with five workout stations. Each piece of equipment has sort of like different settings, adjust the settings. One way to use. It is to do a set sequence where it's like OK. I do this that. I do this and I always follow that same set sequence so you can do all five ways or just. A subset of the five ways in a set sequence another way, People use the exercise equipment is well there. Just go to one. And they'll do a certain setting and that's what they like to do another way that People use the room full of exercise equipment is they'll do 1:00 and then they'll decide I'm going to go over to this other one and they sort of cut in and out. It's considered rude in a public place. But if it's your own set of equipment. You can dupe around and branches. You wish so if you wish to work within the basic mindfulness system. You can either do a set sequence where you can just have a single stand alone. Practice that you do or you can Lupin branch, depending on interest opportunity necessities or like. You know start with one and maybe there's a lot of flow. Or maybe there's a lot of pain and so depending on opportunity on one hand or necessity on another hand. It's like an algorithm and you decide so that's sort of one way to look at the each of the five ways generic exercise. Behavioral challenges are driven by sensory challenges, so sensory challenges are very primary if you're. In a challenging situation in the first thing you do is you make an analysis of. What are the components the sensory components in this sensory challenge and you can also use this not just for yourself but if you happen to be in a helping profession and your guiding some other person. You help them make an analysis of what the sensory challenges. Once you see what the sensory challenges, then you can start to formulate a range of strategies for dealing with it. Fortunately, there's more than one strategy. Typically, an so you can try different ones until you find? What works for example, let's say you have an issue of? Hey physical pain. Like last night, I sat for several hours without moving so at some point I started to get a lot of pain. Clearly part of the sensory challenge is. The uncomfortable touch of the pain. It could happen, though, that you have. Dis concerning mental pictures negative talk. Fear agitation pour me feel flavors so the sensory challenge could be more than just painted could involve three other factors. Essentia Lee there are 3 strategies for dealing with any sensory challenge turned towards it. Turn away from it or focus on how things change things, meaning any and all things including it. The sensory challenge. 'cause focus on changes one of these unifying. Practice is it's one of the practices that destroys distinctions. So a person. Might if they choose to focus on change strategy. Initially, there might, not be any change in the sensory challenge, but there might be some flow in some other part of there being a focus on that and then it starts to move into the sensory challenge. So you can turn towards. And then you bring your concentration clarity and equanimity to the sensory challenge. And that's one way to deal with it. Another way to deal with it is turned away for example, if you have uncomfortable touch and you're having a lot of feeling that stock reactions to it. You could choose to replace those negative feel image talk with positive you'll either be able to do it or not, but that would be to turn away from the sensory challenge focus on positive or you could focus on restful states or you could attempt to focus on. Sounds say the Sound of Music you're moving the attention away from the sensory challenge now as. The problem is that People think if you. Focus away from the sensory challenge, then you're into avoidance denial and suppression. If you focus on the sensory challenge, you're just going to make it worse. And the objection to focus on changes it's not changing it will never change. So then you set yourself up for failure right because all possible strategies you have an objection to. But let's say you had to take an extreme turn away from its strategy. You're in pain. You have a lot of feelings talk reactions, you decide to focus on the Sound of Music. Are you really suppressing or denying? If you conceive of it as. I am wearing. The touch feel image talk Just Dance it stands do its thing. But I'm choosing the background, meaning. Totally give it permission, but I'm not intentionally focusing on it, I am intentionally focusing on the Sound of Music. You actually having equanimity with the sensory challenge, you're not directing your concentration or clarity towards it. But you do have equanimity with and that's an important factor. Your concentration and clarity is directed toward sound. Ann is being strengthened by working against the gravitational tug of the touch feel image talk. You have to bring yourself back to the sound that strengthening your concentration afterward to detect the sound even though all this other stuff is erupting like a pacuvius that Revs up your detection clarity piece so developing mindfulness concentration. And you're developing equanimity with what's going on even though you're not focusing on it, you can conceive of the Endeavour that way, and at some point. The sensory challenge make cool out a bit. And the concentration and clarity that you developed with the sound of the music in output. If you wish to turn that towards the sensory challenge. And you've got a momentum of it and now you are doing a term Tord strategy. And yes, it's true. If you focus your attention on a sensory challenge, sometimes it may exacerbate it. But. Sometimes, things have to inflate before they're ready to deflate or the bubble has to get big before it's going to pop that goes with the turning Tord strategy. So we did yasa last night late night sitting so you get sleepy. So what's the sensory challenge, the sensory challenge is yucky sensations of sleepiness. Once the behavioral challenge the behavioral challenges keep your spine straight your eyes open and your consciousness awake. That's the behavioral challenge well. There's a relationship between sensory challenges behavioral challenge that turned towards strategy is turned towards the actual sensations of sleepiness infuse them with concentration clarity equanimity until they? ARP refused an? Cause you less suffering and at some point probably break up into a flowing enerji that's a term. Tord strategy but you could do a turn away from strategy. You could notice that each wave of sleepiness causes your body to slightly relax. You could notice that as you get sleepy. You can't focus your eyes external vision defocus is causing a restful state of just light coming in your mental screen. Also, maybe come have a lot of light and so forth those a restful states. So you focus away onto the restful states that are being induced by the sleepiness and do not dealing with the sensory challenge, but you use that to carry you through and as I say at some point you may get an experience of flow and then that's a focus on change strategy.","title":"Five Aspects of the Five Ways - 1 of 4"},{"location":"expandcontract/five-aspects-of-the-five-ways-2-of-4/","text":"Each one of the five ways goes back to at least 1. If not many historical traditions that were developed around the world and not exclusively in the E from Buddhism. But they also link to traditions from other parts of the world. the W Christianity. And so forth because as I say I tend to see the world. Wide contemplative tradition. As a unity. You could look back from the five ways and you could see the whole history of the development of. Contemplation from its show monic origins through the arising of Civilizations and through the seminal discoveries of the put down, particularly and then the Mahan's sort of merging with Zen and what came out of that and then the Bud Rihanna and then the sort of more non dual approaches all of that is. Behind it, and we could go I could go into a long tartan have elsewhere as to the rich historical origins of each of the five ways, they have the past. But they also have I believe a future? Because. They represent reworkings of those traditions. I don't claim that these are those traditions. I am attempting to make. Represent a secular modern approach to these things that the spiritual cloud. I don't want to lose the liberating clap that they can each one of them can lead to classical enlightenment can lead to what I believe is the core spiritual experience. Of humanity certainly don't want to lose that cultural trappings, doctrinal trappings things that are based on mythology. I. On things that. In our don't seem to have an empirical basis or. Don't seem probable logically. I have tried to take that out for better or worse. It's an approach that will work for certain People and not work for other People like all approaches. Every approach has strengths and weaknesses and that's good because different things work for different People. This is One Direction that a person could take if they wanted to explore? What can be done creatively with the come down to us from the past just one possible way to go. If you look carefully at the five ways system you'll notice it's all built on binary contrasts. A binary means 1 on one one on one contrast like black versus white that's a binary contrast. That's intentional because when you study. When you do functional image Ng of brain. Changes. As the result of whatever meditation or anything else. You can't actually image, the brain function you can just have 2 contrast in conditions and compare them. So I designed the system to work that way. There's a contrast between tracking ordinary sensory activity. And tracking corresponding restful states, there's a contrast between intentionally creating feeling positive feel image talk at just observing any at all feel image talk. There's a contrast between working with the subject if somatic visual and auditory experience versus object if somatic visual and auditory experience. The contrast between relative rest. Where you're focusing on restful qualities an absolute rest where you do nothing etc, etc, etc? Anyone of those. Presents itself as a natural. Thing that can be studied with the imaging technology. So when I say that the five ways have a future. Hopefully, by that. I mean, they've been set up based on what I know that scientists need. When they do this kind of research so that it can be easily their effects can be easily researched in subsequent generations.","title":"Five Aspects of the Five Ways - 2 of 4"},{"location":"expandcontract/five-aspects-of-the-five-ways-3-of-4/","text":"One of the Uh. Main discoveries of the historical buta. Was this notion that? You could. Take the phenomenon of limited suffering self and analyze it into its components. And as the result of that. Your identification with the limited suffering self would be broken and the sense that. There ever even was a limiting suffering self. Evaporates. In early Buddhism. There were a number of ways of sort of chopping up the pod. The 5:00 Aggregates of clinging if we were to put into more contemporary vocabulary would probably be something like the 5 things People tend to identify with. So what do we identify with route but the physical but they do not you can interpret the Poly word fadanuf broader neroli? You can interpret it as applying to any and all sensory experience just body or just body sensation but I would say. However, you interpret it the thing that really gets us. Are the are the emotional pleasures and pains? It's it's hard, but you can learn to accept. Physical pain in the body. People learn to do this, but how many People can have on a rising of. Terror or grief or rage in their body and. It's just. Narrow it just doesn't get them OK. That's really, really hard, even though it's just body sensation they're much harder to. Have a complete experience up why because? But I call feel all know my definition of field body sensation. That seems to a given individual at a given time to be emotionally nature. Those are sensations that have been honed by the evolutionary process to be an internal reward and punishment system. To control us robotically? So it's really, really hard to have a complete experience of field but it's well worth. OK, so rupa veda not. Sonya Sonya means concept. Means thinking. But. Concept is very conceptual, I like to. Deal with thinking in terms that it's a sensor event image talk now. You might say but what about the unconscious. Well, when you develop a sensitivity to wear images arise. Most of you had this experience at some point. The surface images don't arise. But you're aware there's some activity down there a lot of activity that's subconscious visual thinking. You develop a sensitivity to where you can hear internal talk at some point you don't hear the words anymore. But there is a rumbling of 1000 voices down there. That's subconscious auditory thinking, so you can directly experience and monitor the subconscious by using the categories image space and taught space even if there's no explicit image activity or talk activity. So that's at least. One level of the subconscious. Then there's this thing called? Some scara in Sanskrit or some Cara Pauley. It's a plural actually some car's. That's the. That's the deep unconscious. Mind. Where the habit patterns are stored? One way to get that in contact with that those very deep. Levels that you can't directly observe their below. Even the subtle feel image talk. There, like way way down. There is sort of look at your sub personalities or you look at your habitual modes. I mean? You know, I've got certain certain grooves that I just fall into right there's like there's like there's the OK, let's. Entertain ourselves with mathematic group mathematics, groove, OK that's one of my groups is OK. Let's run a sexual fantasy group that's another one. I don't wanna do. The other then then then there's uh OK. I gotta do some writing because I'm meditation teacher and I gotta do. That's like another group got to work with students group like all People see how their practices going. That's a lot easier than sit down and write texts and articles and that's a hard group OK. It's like somebody calls and there in crisis and they got 3 hours. That's great totally hot for it. 'cause I know what the probable results are and doesn't really take that much effort on my part is an algorithm. I see the whole chess game in front of me 12 moves ahead for years and years and years. Practice. So when some personalities are these like major sort of habit patterns come up, I can sense this. This cone that's going down deep deep deep into my subconscious. It broadens as it goes down and it's accessing all that previous conditioning and the tip of it is coming up as this sensory event of his pattern. So it's Just space simultaneously expanding and contracting. If I could experience it that way, then I could break the identification. Then there's Viciana, Oregon Yana in Poly that means consciousness. I don't know what consciousness is by and traditional Buddhism. It comes in 6 flavors hearing seeing smelling tasting and body sensation. In my system it's touch that sound healing. Massage me like socialize islands piece point quiet. Those are the flavors. I don't know what consciousness is but it comes in those flavors. But we can also consider it. In its Vanilla form with independent of flavor. When we consider independent of flavor, then we call it consciousness. In the traditional Buddhist Formulation. Consciousness is no more spiritual than your material body. It's spiritual is 0. The material body is called Rupa and the other four aggregates are. Are collectively called namah? Nirvana is explicitly defined as beyond Namor Lupa. That's where I was thinking of that story, there's a monk who. It's pretty enlightened gone pretty far. And he Is having a conversation with his master and it gets late into the night? And so it's time to go back to his room and so of course. They didn't have flashlights in those days. He's he's this candle and steps out of the room. I remember he's pretty enlightened.

Sort of divided things up this way. Said This is what we tend to identify with. Physical body. Pleasant versus unpleasant. Thoughts. Habit forces and consciousness itself. But if you divide it up and then you subdivide you can take the physicality of your body and they didn't have modern chemistry. They didn't have the periodic table of the elements what they had was. Before classical elements or water air and fire they would. Break the experience of body into those elements. That was a subdivided. So if you divide it all up. Then you'll see. It's just this stuff and there's not a thing called a self here. My modern reworking of that is the focus in. Take I take the what I would consider to be the core sense of self. Which is feel which is sort of related to the beta them? And the image talk, which are definitely related to the Sun Janelle. But it is possible to have a broader definition of self its body mind self I find that. Through feel image talk you can. Yeah, you can get a sense of the unconscious forces so anyway. Same idea. But it's a little different because feel image talk are all three of them are sensory events. That can be monitored in time. And so by I find that if you can separate them out. Then the something Ness of self goes away. And when they get conflated or tangled together. Then you get the illusion of self as thing, so the focus in is my reworking of. The finding a spiritual self in the sense of becoming free from the limited. Identity with thought and feeling. My reworking of that divide and conquer but instead of using the 5:00 aggregates. I just use the 3:00 subjective sensory elements. So that's One way to. One strategy for finding a spiritual self focus out. You. Is based on more of Zen way of working so you having to work all day and you want to experience emerging with your environment well focus out. Anchor in touch sight sound. Feeling his talk to contracts touch sight sound expands easy to do, but are not easy, but natural to do as you're doing physical tests with physical tasks all about done sites out so you get the confusion that you get the confusion ethical values of working. With the Taoist Spiritual paradigm of merge with the outside world. So my focus out reworks that strategy. Focus on rest is a reworking of the. Absorption practices of early Buddhism, the idea. There is you discover a restful self. Actually, a restful selfina restful world. I do that the restful self is instead of feel image talk. It's peaceful and quiet. The restful world instead of touch side sound it's relaxation light silence. So this forms an attenuated experience of self in world. Not quite the absolute no self in the world of the source. But moving in that direction. After all, the absorption practices are never claimed to be Nirvana. But they're sort of moving in that direction, so they focus on rest is a reworking of that paradigm focus on positive. Well, you're actively manipulating feeling which talk clearly this is related to things like the Brahmaviharas. The Loving kindness practices. Such of early Buddhism is also related to the deity yoga, practices of much later, Buddhism. The Bud Rihanna. What came after my honor. From my perspective. It's basically concentration clarity and equanimity in subject of space developed by actively manipulating subjective spaces imposter passively observing the way we do with focus in. But certainly if you are manifesting. Positive feel image talk. You know. I don't know that it will necessarily turn you into a money magnet, but it will turn you into a People magnet that I can guarantee. That that People will be attracted to you and that People will want to be with you and find you a source of. Comfort and inspiration. A priest Catholic priest once asked my teacher, Sasaki Roshi what his take on Christianity was. And he said. Well. It's about crucifixion and resurrection. I totally believe in crucifixion and resurrection. Or she said that the price is all happy, all good. It's much. You believe in resurrection, absolutely I totally believe in Reston. And he does and crucifixion, but idea of crucifixion is. Uh. That. You get crucified by the source. You get pinned and torn apart. Stretched and nailed. By the forces of expansion and contraction with something is within you dies, but then is resurrected. As positive feel image toca better self because you could go to the source. You could die and it's like born again, but Big time born again not a little time born again. It's all about crucifixion and resurrection. So. Focus on positive in its most advanced forms. Actually comes is the new life that comes from the death. That occurs. Through focus on change.","title":"Five Aspects of the Five Ways - 4 of 4"},{"location":"expandcontract/five-basic-assumptions-in-mindfulness-practice/","text":"There are certain axioms or basic assumptions behind mindfulness, these lead to not logical conclusions, but they lead to. When implemented they lead to experiential developments within a person. So I say that there are certain assumptions that underlie mindfulness as I would teach it. I think that they are very reasonable assumptions that they could be accepted by anyone, but they are assumptions, the first assumption is that? The ability to focus on what deems relevant. Whenever one wants to have that ability is better than to not have that ability that's an assumption, although. Some of the work and positive psychology would seem to prove that assumption, but anyway, we can take that as a basic axiom In other words, it's better to have the ability to concentrate on what you want then to lack that ability notice by the way I said the ability to focus on what you deem relevant at any given time I didn't say that you're necessarily constrained to go around as a concentration machine always. Always highly focused 8 but that you have the ability. Whenever you want to focus on what is deemed relevant in that circumstance so that's the axiom of concentration. Then there's an axiom that it's better to be sensorially clear about what's going on, then to be sensorially modeled? That's another assumption in mindfulness 3rd axiom is that it's. Good to be able to not fight with yourself. At least have that ability, sometimes you might have to fight with yourself under certain circumstances, but most People always are fighting with themselves in subtle ways very, very microscopic subtle ways without even realizing it and it's good to have the ability not to fight with yourself. That's the axiom of equanimity. Then there's a fourth axiom that I call recycle the reaction. Which is as the result of applying the axioms of concentration clarity and equanimity your sensory experience may change it may change in temporarily an unpleasant ways or it may change in pleasant ways. It is even possible that strange experiences might arise. They do for some People not for everyone as the result of merely applying what would seem to be. Fairly innocuous axioms of concentration clarity and equanimity the 4th Axiom is really important because it tells you what to do, if the first three axioms produce anything that's challenging either in the sense that it's pleasant and therefore you might get addicted or in the sense that it's unpleasant and therefore you might suffer, or in the sense that it's weird and therefore you might sort of freak out as the result of applying the first three axioms. Reactions might take place not inevitably not saying they will take place for everyone. Not everyone gets heavenly or hellish or bizarre phenomenon. But just in case they do remember the force 4th axiom recycle. The reaction and then there's one final axiom. The 5th Axiom, which is if you forget the first four axioms. The 5th Axiom says have contact information of a competent guide and call them. And that will remind you of the first four axioms. So those are the 5:00 axioms 8. Euclid had 5 two by the way 5 postulate so I'm in good company.","title":"Five Basic Assumptions in Mindfulness Practice"},{"location":"expandcontract/five-fold-sila-in-pali/","text":"Ah naughty bottle.

Don't care and don't even know whether it's somatic visual or auditory. Those descriptors discriminations breakdown. Subjective versus object. If breaks down ordinary versus restful breaks down all you're interested in is just flow. And you actually begin to lose specificity with regards to all the distinctions that we make in the other techniques. That's highly desirable. You can't make that happen. But there's really you know how I always say it's a dialectical process. So half of the dialectic is making these discriminations in a healthy way. The other half is destroying the discriminations also in a healthy way. Flow is Locom Platis, ill it's the great leveler. That destroys distinctions, the only greater level or is gone. That.

The. Greek adjective that means related to movement change and the underlying forces and energies that could produce movement and change so I like that. Word dynamic that covers a wide range in its definition. So we can within ordinary or restful experience distinguish a static aspect and a dynamic aspect and we're particularly interested in the dynamic aspect. Not that that's better than the static but when it appears it's something that we can choose to work with and it's continuous side. I call flow and it's. More abrupt or discontinuous side. I call gone our vanishing in terms of working with change. You can focus on just the flow or just the banishing but if there happens to be vanishings within the flows bursts of flows arise and then noticeably subside. You could sort of combine those 2. Is that flow or is that just my heart beating? Its flow because anything where you can focus on the theme of changing this. Counts as flow, so things that have Vibra Tori, or pulsatory qualities. Whatever their source. Maybe definitely count as flow. A lot of the subtle vibra. Tori flow that People report through their body is in fact. The pulse well it's the circulation of the blood through the vessels that causes those like Vibra. Tori sensations and you can know that because if you run or something like that. You get more of that stuff, so it doesn't matter if the sense of flow has been produced by some gross physical something obviously material physical in origin. It's not like there's some. That doesn't count as an instance of change because it's like Oh just by heart beating kind of thing. There is a wide range of flavors of flow, but basically. There's various frequencies that I call Generically Vibra Tori, but People talk about how. Weather words People use bubbly scintillating missed twinkly sparkly. What are some of the other ones for the sort of vibra Tori? Well, Vibra Tori use that generically for all the frequencies. Pulse pulsation for this lower frequencies, so there's sort of generically stuff, it seems like it's vibrating. Then there's stuff that seems more WAVY sort of lava lamp like seaweed in a tidepool kind of streaming protoplasm. That kind of thing and then there's spreading collapsing outward pressures inward pressures sense of scattering sense of gathering expensive contractive type flavors. All of the above counters flow so vast range of phenomena and certainly unawareness of the heartbeat and an awareness of the blood making sort of Vibra. Tori flow throughout the body is definitely an instance of flow. How does TS Eliot put it? The dance along the artery the circulation of the lymph is figured in the drift of stars. It's all part of Nature's flow. As a general principle within the system flow is just something if it's there. You observe it if it's not there, then it's not there. The static aspect is dominant. Now that's not to say that. There's some cosmic meditative rule that you're not allowed to do practices that intentionally create or manipulate flow. That's not the case at all. That's integral to a lot of cheap going exercises. Kundalini yoga exercises and so forth and it's completely valid practice and if you want to do those practices and then get things going with that and then you go to a VPS and on you just observe. Well, that's fine, but I wouldn't consider it part of Vipasa, not strictly speaking. Yes, with time and practice the resolution can be so great that there's always flow every. Having said that though. That's very dangerous, it's one of the things like that statement that are one of the reasons. I'm a bad meditation teacher because I say something like that. They put their said safe say only what is true and useful? What I just said is true, it's arguable whether it's useful? Because. It could be useful well let's make the case. It's useful. Obviously, I must have thought it's in some sense useful. I wouldn't say it at all. It's useful because it can inspire People and give People a goal to work towards it's not useful and in fact, extremely harmful. Statement. If it sets up in that person, A. I need. To have that kind of resolution. At a sense of failure and frustration when you don't. That's a general theme in working with flow if you got flow in one area. It will have a natural tendency to induce flow in other areas and you could sort of. You sort of. This is a little weird sounding but so let's say you have flow in one domain and you have solidity over here. As what the meditator can do is play the role of. The shot Han you don't know that word but a shadow. Khan is Jewish. Marriage broker you sort of get the flow part and introduce the flow part of the solid part and then you don't need to do anything more. They just have a pretty yeah. That's right.

In general, we can classify. The focus methods in terms of. Are they just letting the attention sort of go? Wherever it goes? I call that free floating and then you know being aware where it is going. Are they saying OK? We're going to systematically sort of scroll through the possibilities and then start again. I call that inventory or are we going to try to cover all the possibilities at once. I call that even coverage. Easiest to understand with regards to the body but can be generalized to any sensory experience. I have a technique that I call, noting body locations, so here. The categories are body locations. And it's just OK let your attention go wherever it wants to go and no knee face stomach probably 95% of the people in this room have done that with me up on occasion well. I would say that's a free floating strategy. You just as it comes up. Yes, you can exercise some control. But it's basically what pulls you. And the elements here are the various locations of sensation. By way of contrast, a systematic inventory is OK. We're going to go through the body part by part and sample? What's there and then maybe repeat that cycle, which could be done in any one of dozens of ways. You could go sort of like band by band or you could go like let's take the right leg. The left leg the right on the left line or if you want to be fancy and get down to release subtle levels of sensation and really subtle levels of flow. You can attempt to continuously sweep the awareness, either over the surface of the body or even like a cat scan right through the body that could be up and down. Right to left left to right front to back back to front that's a continuous inventory. And you can even get fancier if you want you can go in spirals as all sorts of stuff you can do, make it continuous inventory of the body. By way of contrast to that OK hold all the locations simultaneously in awareness. Even coverage I called? The advantage to the systematic inventory is that it make sure you cover all the everything. And so it brings a lot of sensitization and a lot of detail. The disadvantage might be that there's not much to detect. But of course, if you have the categories of restful states. Then you can detect the absence is a presence but sometimes People that do the body sweeping sort of Get Lossed 'cause. They can't detect sensations that can be a possible difficulty with that. Even coverage is sort of at the opposite end it. It integrates and gives you the big picture and ultimately you know since sensory events. Do tend to spread. It's good to be able to cover large pieces of sensory experience to have the ability to do that. Most People if you say the word concentration. They assume it implies a narrowing of attention, but Sasaki Rosi is adamant that there's 2 flavors of concentration. Not surprisingly, contractive where you restrict the range of focus and expensive where you get a flavor of being highly concentrated precisely because you're holding all parts of a large object, either at once or. You know more or less at once so the even coverage builds that flavor and it gives you the big picture and it leads to integrations. Things have to be integrated before they can be Anaya lated Ann. Their annihilation takes them to their source. So. That's something to be said for the even coverage, but it's challenging because, like you lose contact with pieces and so forth so my language for even coverage is hold it as broadly as you can without straining typically. I'll say something like that, so the advantage now to the free float is it's natural it's not as hard work as the inventory or the even coverage that People can typically do it right away and find it more fun. Then the other other two I would say typically I don't know that there's any disadvantage to it specifically. But I can't think think of right off hand but that would be briefly some sort of to compare and contrast, the strategies. Or let's say, Let's say focus in focus out. And focus on rest are based on a free floating. In general. The however, remember even when you're free floating you are allowed to zoom out so those are sort of brief moments of even coverage. If you zoom out to fill touch space or something so there is in the zoom in zoom out option. There's like brief sort of coverage available, but essentially in focus in focus out and focus on rest your free floating. Among the categories. Anne if more than one is present, you just choosing one in focus on change when you're noting flow. You are not making distinctions between where the flow is. At all, I mean, you're not intentionally making distinctions so it's wherever the flow is meaning if the flow infects somatic visual and auditory and at the moment of note flow. You elect to zoom out. You are doing the ultimate even coverage. You're covering all sensory spaces at once so it fits in there. I use systematic inventories at during special exercise is actually quite a bit now focus on positive your. You do evenly cover, whichever 1 two or all three of the spaces that you're doing. You can attempt to hold the positive in all 3 at once if you want. Or you can sort of I don't know so sort of hold it in all 3 but not work. Too hard and it's sort of free floats, but it's always going to positive in any one of them you could do it as a kind of free float. Or you could do it as an even coverage strategy. In general, it's dividing conquer right so if you're trying to work with a big piece of experience and you can't then. Then you work with smaller stuff, so if you're trying and even coverage and it doesn't work, then try free floating or probably better still systematic inventory and then you could build to coverage.

The impatient locations or just noted as feel if you want to use a generic technique so let's say that you're noting feel image talk and the image and talk go away because you're forcing yourself to say the labels out loud. However, what happens to feel is that now there's an agitated uncomfortable quality of the field. So then you would not feel feel with spoken labels and the more you speak the more that discomfort comes up. But that's good because that's observable that's a set a somatic quality. It has location. It has intensity. It has flavor in the body. You can observe it and you can open up to it. The whole idea. In doing something like spoken labels. Is to take invisible patterns of force that scatter our attention? And transmute them into observable patterns of sensation or perhaps also image Doc. But usually it's an agitated sensation and observable pattern of sensation that you can then work with because invisible patterns of force, are extremely difficult to work with. They've just what you described they just got you cite your observing and now you're not observing you're not. On the edge of the stream you are you have entered the stream and not in the good sense. Not enough carried by the stream of Enlightenment, you're being drowned in the stream of Karma. Now you're uncomfortable in the body. That means that the spoken labels have made an invisible pattern of force. That's been scattering you into an observable trackable pattern of. Sensation all be, it, perhaps are very uncomfortable sensation, but it is still trackable and you can note that sensation. And what is trackable eventually becomes tractable? And you will have worked through the invisible scattering force, which is intractable. One of the very elegant and clever features of mindfulness practice is I repeat. It takes invisible an intractable problem, which is force forces are controlling me that I don't like. And there's nothing I can do about it. And it transforms that problem, a problem of dealing with invisible forces. Into the problem of observing. Actual body sensations. And then as you eat quantum eyes that you solve that problem that translates back into now. Those forces no longer have a hold on huge fundamental. Tool.

I'm ethically bound to tell you what's going to make that affective. Even though it might not be what you want to hear. There's 3 reasons People don't want to do spoken labels. Number one, it's very hard work. And we sort of think well, I came here to instead of like have this mellow experience. I don't want to have to work. It's hard work, but that's what we came to do so. First cause of resistance hard work second cause it's going to make you uncomfortable hopefully. OK and 30 is. This proves what I've always known. I'm a child of a lesser God.

It's true, it's as a general principle. You want to work towards actually no labels at all if possible. But. You can think of those label options as like gears in your car. Uh. If you're going up a steep Hill, meaning. What makes a Hill steep as you're sitting? Is? One or both of the following. Lot of Doo Doo coming from the outside world. Lot to do coming from the lot of data coming from the inside world. So one or both of those means you're going up a Hill. The fact that when you go up a very steep Hill.

For that would cover all the needs of humanity. One of the problems that were as I look upon it 3 problems. One is his notion of the nature of number. Was too limited? Essentially, it was positive whole integers, the 2nd is that they didn't have the experimental method to explore nature. That only developed with Galileo Francis Bacon, Newton in his optics for example, and then subsequent researchers scientists. And then the other things, the other thing Agent Greeks lacked was methods of developing enough concentration power systematically. To explore the nature of the inner world, so they didn't didn't know how to make experiments to explore the nature of the outer world and they didn't have the technology of high concentration. That India did have. That you need in order to explore the inner world and they didn't have an adequate concept of number. In order to model either 1. But I think that we now are in a position to fulfill the pythagorean agenda. Because we now have a notion of number that's broad enough. Both the outer dance and the inner dance can be modeled with our present number system because it has enough contrasts built in. To explore the different flavors of expansion and contraction. the W has discovered the concentration methods from the East and we have the experimental method for looking at the outside nature. There's A teaching in Mahayana Buddhism that all beings have the put down nature. The Greek word for nature. The thing that pythagoras. And Western civilization from his time on wanted to study. The word was physis and that's given us, the word physics for example, physics is the study of the nature of things. I think that. The confluence. Of. The empirical method. The.

So then I started focusing on wonderful memories that we had had. And. I remembered great times. We had growing up an I would focus on that memory and then the love and the feeling which is radiate out of me towards him. And I said there for hours and felt so much love and gratitude for him in my life and. About two 3:00 o'clock in the morning. The love kind of went away because of the exhaustion and I started to have talk of you know just Oh I'm tired. I want to sleep. But then by focusing on that talk and then changing that, to love and so instead of going down the road of the negative talk I focused on positive talk. An I would just sit there and I would just say love and I'd feel the love going out to him. I'd go love. I love you so much. I mean, I would just any loving thought or talk that I could say in my head to radiate towards my brother. That's what I did. You know, I I live my life that I try to love People day today. An I try to be there for them and I try to cherish them. But I've never experienced a love that deep when I am in such a vulnerable state. And he's in such a vulnerable state that. To feel that love radiating towards him hour after hour? It was a great it was a great gift that. That, he gave to me that night. For me. By using the whole positive interstates. It truly changed. The way I feel about my brother. I have so much love and compassion in my heart for him. And I feel like I love him on so much of a deeper level now and. And I am just so grateful for for him and for the love and for the time that we that we have shared, he he he has had a full recovery and I am so grateful for that. I know that without that technique. I would have gone to the hospital. I would have suffered I would have heard all the negative stuff that was happening. I would've heard he was going to die for this reason, or that reason or you know, I mean, I would have heard all of that negative stuff and I would have freaked out. I would have been I would have been in a panic state, I would have would not have been able to focus. I would not have been I would have been so consumed with all the negativity of the situation. Then I then I just would have been in a huge ball of suffering. Because of these this technique. It turned a terrable negative situation in my life. Into a deep clean of love for my brother. I am forever, grateful for this technique.","title":"Hold Positive Feel"},{"location":"expandcontract/home-and-on-site-retreats-with-shinzen-young/","text":"People have been writing in questions to this channel. About what happens at my retreats, so I'd like to talk a little bit about what you can expect if you do a retreat with me. I do 2 kinds of retreats actually. One is on site type situation, which is more like the traditional way of teaching for householders where you come to a value off and it will be a residential situation where you stay overnight. Although not inevitably it might be a computer type situation where you come in for one day or weekend. But you go home. But I call those onsite retreats because I'm physically present there. So I do on-site retreats around the world, mostly in North America and you can find the schedule for those at the website shinzen.org. Then I do. Another kind of retreat that I call the home practice program and that comes to you by conference call. Uh you do that, from wherever you are in the world and you register for those retreats by going to basicmindfulness.org and the whole program is explained there and that's a really cool program because it takes away all of the show stoppers. The speed bumps that People have to do. The other with regards to doing the other kinds of retreats because for an on-site type retreat. You need to. Leave your home leave your family incur losses of job time incur perhaps travel expenses and loss of income. And so forth in a troubled economy that can be problematic and also People don't want to be away from their families. Their schedules don't allow for travel there might, not be a center in their area. You might be living in a part of the world where you don't have a? Up even a place you could go to to do something like that. Or you might be disabled Cath leave your house so we wanted to create. A delivery system for what I call? Industrial strength, but user friendly meditation that anybody can have regardless of their familial work financial or health situation or geographic situation so that's the whole practice program. You register for that and we give you an access code in a telephone number to call at the appointed time. Most of those are done in 4 hour blocks just about anybody can get 4 hours. During a month to do the practice and that's a second delivery system. If you come to a residential retreat with me or computer retreat with me In other words, If you do an onsite type program. You have the advantage of a buildup of momentum and so forth. If you do a whole practice program, you have the advantage of enormous convenience. Sometimes People ask well if I go to one of his. On-site retreats. Will I have to practice his techniques? And the answer is absolutely no not required at my retreats. You are free to practice whatever form of meditation in which? Lot of People come to my programs because they want to learn my approach is an my techniques that so-called five way system of basic mindfulness that I teach and you will have a chance. Of course to learn that, but it is by no means required that you practice that either at the retreat or for your own self practice. It's been my experience over the years of teaching that different things work for different People at different times and there. Spiritual itinerary. So my basic model about what to do, if you were to ask me well. How should I meditate what how should I practice. I would say do what works I'm not alone in this regard another senior teacher Joseph Goldstein wrote a book called One Dharma and basically that's if you had to sum it up in a sound bite. That's what the book is about and that's been my conclusion also do what works so now you don't have to do any other. Five ways that my retreats, the way I think of the organization of the practice is I have this system of 5 approaches. And then there's everything else that anybody ever did that worked. So I divide all ways of practicing into. The five ways, which in some ways, is just a modernization of a whole bunch of old stuff, so stuff that sort of fits within that framework and then anything else that doesn't fit within that framework. I refer to them as special exercises. You can mix. The five ways with special exercises. You can mix it with whatever you want to do just totally free to practice as you wish. So I I like People that study with me. As the result of having studied with me. Not too. Become a Devil T of my way of teaching but rather to see the commonality with in all the ways of teaching so that they can be comfortable with anybody's program. They can make use of everybody's program from my perspective. There's only one teacher. Even the universe through all times. There's just one teacher. And she is the 1000 armed. 1000 headed goddess of compassion. And each one of us individual teachers sort of represents one head that a couple of. Arms on that single archetype. And if you look at the This is of a low key tation for our common in Japanese, one yen in Chinese. A quantum in Korean. Well and one in Vietnamese and generaci into bed and known by many names sometimes actually Mail, but often in East Asia females. So I call her the thousand armed goddess of compassion. If you look at this particular archetype. You'll see each one of her hands has a different attribute a different object a different symbol and to me. That represents all the different approaches that different teachers have developed over the ages, but we're all limbs on one. Formless activity. That pervades time in space each one of us contributes as best we can to this overall activity, so my job as a teacher is too. Set you up to. See things that way so that we all of us teachers can share this huge job that needs to be done. For the world.","title":"Home and On-Site Retreats with Shinzen Young"},{"location":"expandcontract/how-do-i-find-a-good-meditation-teacher/","text":"How do you find a good meditation teacher or teachers? Well, one way to consider this is to think about different kinds of Teachers. I have in my own mind a kind of map. A classification system for. Teaching actually I don't really think. So much in terms of Teachers. I don't think so. Much in terms of the noun teacher. I think more in terms of the verb teaching there is an activity called teaching broadly I classify the activity of teaching. Under 3 headings. There is subtle teaching. There is descriptive teaching and then there is explicit teaching from my perspective. Everyone who does a spiritual practice or a meditative practice? Is a teacher in that they teach? But they may only teach at the subtle level. So what does it mean to teach at the subtle? Well, 2 things as the result of doing the practice. We change our vibe changes how we carry ourselves moment by moment our body orders probably change our pheromones change. Things about us change and that shows perhaps only at a subtle level. It shows the body language. As I say page showing him orders. Subtle cues how we breathe? How our eyes look here there and so forth. Changes take place within us as the results of this practice People can detect those changes, perhaps. Consciously, or perhaps below the threshold of awareness. And that puts out a subtle teaching. You could be talking about anything you could be doing anything but you're coming from a certain place. As the result of your practice here suddenly teaching with every action. You do every syllable you utter even People who haven't done much meditation. The changes already started to happen. So that's one aspect of subtle teaching another aspect of subtle teaching is. More large scale our behaviors improve or they should if they're not then there's a problem. And People that know us see the the behaviors improving. And that's impressive to People. Very impressive actually and the. There, in that make some interested sympathetic maybe wanting to do that path or that practice themselves. So the behavior changes that take place with time. Coupled with this sort of. Vibe changes the enter so we say Energi changes that take place. To me, this counts constitutes teaching there for every practitioner is automatically a subtle teacher. Then there's descriptive teaching what descriptive teaching means is you have a practice somebody asks you to describe your practice and you could do so coherently coherently means there's Clear vocabulary. Well formulated senses it all hangs together logically that's what cohere means you can debate coherent description of what you do in words that the average person can understand. I call that the descriptive level of teaching. I have a little phrase that I use which is. What is coherent is Cogent? Cogent means compelling. It means all that makes sense and I see the point. Maybe I'd like to do it myself, so if you're not telling them to do it, you're not proselytizing you're not. Giving them a practice and explicitly teaching them You're just describing Hey. This is what I do. When I have physical discomfort. I do this and it has this effect when I have emotional challenges. I do this and it has this effect. When I do formal practice. I do this sometimes, this happens and sometimes that happens. You're giving a coherent description of your practice. Well, that's a teacher. And that's a level of teaching. So any of you that have a practice and can coherently describe it. 2 People inwards average. People People that don't have a practice. Then I say you're a teacher. At that level teacher, then there's explicit EG. Explicit teaching is. You are running a meditation class or your privately tutoring someone. And you are giving them techniques your answering their questions. You're giving them detailed guidance. You're monitoring their progress and so forth you're explicitly now in teacher. Some People Evolved to a place in their practice. Where they would like to be an explicit teacher and that's good usually you need some sort of training for that, although not inevitably. Tell you the truth when I moved from being. Descriptive teacher to an explicit teacher. I myself did not have any training to do that. I just started to experiment and see what worked maybe that's not the best scenario, but that's what I did, and you know it just evolved with time. Among explicit teachers. I would say that there are various subcategories there're paraprofessional teachers. That is to say teachers that. Teach part time and my organization, we call them facilitators. I've trained numerous many, many People to be facilitators. They can help out at retreats. They can answer questions and so forth. Uh sort of like a paramedic, there a paraprofessional. Then there are professional teachers a professional teacher teaches full time someone like me, they derive their lively livelihood that way. Among full time teachers. There is a class of full time teachers that are capable of dealing with classical enlightenment when it starts to happen to People they can handle that phenomenon. They can they can handle the pathologies that may occur occasionally that kind of company classical implement occasionally don't get all freaked out. It doesn't happen that often so we might call them Masters. People that aren't afraid of the E word enlightenment. So. If you can find a teacher in that category that you can relate to. Then that's good, it doesn't have to be 1 now. You might find several teachers in that category that you can relate to, if you can't find a teacher in that category who is comfortable with handling the Enlightenment issue, then OK just find a professional teacher somebody that's You know does this is established and if you can't find that a paraprofessional. If you have fun that then a descriptive teacher if you have find that then just. So when the teachers of the subtle level. Would be my general recommendations as far as sort of how to think about teachers.","title":"How do I find a good meditation teacher"},{"location":"expandcontract/how-the-endeavor-of-improve-supports-transcend/","text":"It's not an uncommon experience that People report well. I'm sort of spinning my wheels with my formal practice. This like you know, I don't seem to be getting anywhere with the database sense, etc, etc. Um. Sometimes, if you Do some good thing in the world. Special you volunteer you do something and then you go back to your formal practice you'll see that. It's sort of like now, it's moving again. That would be an example of the the saver or the what you put out. Influencing what you experience. It's it goes to a somewhat somewhat broader formulation. Which is? See beyond self in world refined self, it or improve self, OK, so you make improvements in yourself in your world. Um. That will then influence your experience during formal practice, which is the main place that you're trying to see beyond the self in the world. So it's a little larger than save. It's more improved, yeah for example. Diet lifestyle ethics, Cilla OK. Traditionally, it, said well sort of get that together before you even try to set because otherwise it's just going to be cast sitting when we try to set so the fact that you have a certain lifestyle that you have that you're not bringing all this. Awareness of guilt and bad, Karma you know. To your since you know it conflicted about as as less conflicted about your life because you're living your life in a better way. You know, perhaps diet enters in exercises. All that sort of stuff, so those are those are improvements in yourself, you bring those improvements will probably improve your experience informal practice and then there's the knowledge that you're putting up good good things into the world and that's in your subliminal consciousness. And it's There, when you whether your surface aware of it or not. It's sort of there in your practice and that supports you also so it's it's really broader than how. Save support Sodom and it's more like how the Endeavour of improve supports the Endeavour of transit.","title":"How the Endeavor of 'Improve' Supports 'Transcend_"},{"location":"expandcontract/humility-to-the-vanishing-point-no-self-around-the-world/","text":"Yesterday I wrote out. The just occured to me, too right. The term. For no self in. The Islamic tradition of Sufism, which is phenom. Then it occurred to me, it might be interesting to write to look at all the words that are used by the meditating Mystics. Around the world. For their version of what humility is. So. Here we go. So we'll we'll start, where we started last night. So this is. Arabic. It's pronounced fanatic. FAN. And that's the technical term in the Sufi tradition. 4. Watt, in the Buddhist tradition is called no self. So let's. Juxtaposed with that Hebrew. It's also written from right to left. So this says, Betul Hi Ash. In. Paper language that would be romanized. BITULHA. Edge. Betul means annihilation so very similar to funnel. And ha means the and Yash is something nahs, something Ness of self something. Ness of world or existence. Yesh is the common Hebrew word for exist. So the annihilation of something is. Of Self, an world pretty much sums it up. By the way after Betul Hi Ash. Comes pre are once you annihilate the something nahs. Then you become the doing this. So you are able to participate in the flip side of the annihilation which is the. Pre ieshima iron the moment by moment continuous arising of Yesh things met from iron the divine nothing. An infant in the Sufi tradition has exactly the same thing after phenom is something called the car. Which is? Now you're stabilized with the source and you can understand how the world is coming from God Allah and so forth. So very parallel type situations, so that's Islam Judaism. Now let's look at Christianity. Now. Early Christianity, the mystical writings were in Greek to called the Greek father's. They lived in the deserts of. Palestine Egypt and so forth and there's amazing writings from that patristic period. So what is the oldest of the Christian terms for the no self experience? Wait, a minute I think. I think that's an Omega sorry I think I misspelled it. Not a normal Cron, but I could be wrong. I should really check these things out for I present them to the world. Kenosis. If we were to romanize it. KENOS&O sis doesn't mean a disease by the way it means a process an kennels in Greek means empty. Oh, interesting Lee directly cognate to the Sanskrit Word Junya. Because the car sound the valor. Stop voiceless fellow stop of the car sound in Proto Indoeuropean became a shot, which is a palatalized F in Sanskrit, so actually Sanskrit is modified from the early Proto Indoeuropean Greek still preserves the cuss sound so kennels in Greek is a direct Indoeuropean Cognitive Shinya. In Sanskrit, an interesting. Similar spiritual interpretation can Oasys is the process of emptying out. Emptying out of something nahs that the Christian meditator's sought. And if if you could achieve a deep enough kenosis. Then you would be able to experience theosis theosis. Which means guarding literally see Greek is a very subtle language there's 2 words in God a 2 words in Greek. Theosis an apotheosis. Apotheosis is deification in the sense that the ancient Roman emperors claimed to be gods. But theosis is deification in the sense that the Christian, who empties themselves out. Takes on Divine attributes not infinite power and that kind of thing, but the goodness the compassion and so forth. So you become more God like in that sense, and. Culminating in Talk about it subtle use of language and an interesting word. The combination of Kenosis. According to the Greek desert father's is to become ESO restos. ISO. You know what that means in Greek means equivalent hisoka restos is Christ equivalent. Now I like to. Very irreverently translate that into modern English as. You experience what it's like to be Nano Christ. A very, very, very miniature version of dying. In order to be of service to others. Your own personal version as opposed to the cosmic version, which is I think that would be the. The Mega Christ OK, OK, so kenosis. So now we've got Islam Judaism, Christianity, the western religions. Let's go to. Buddhism. So. Just to put it in an index script for the fun of it. This is Devanagari, which is the North Indian alphabet used to write Sanskrit Hindi and such but I just wrote a Poly word. In it, and uh to. ANATTA. And this is the famous doctrine of the put out no self as thing. That gets translated into various Asian languages. Let's start with. Tibetan. Screw that up. That's how you do it. Not pretty. Tibetan it's called document or dominant. If you romanize it. BDAG. Dot Med. And another dot. Butitspronounced.net. And it literally means self and mam beans without or not so that just directly translates. In. E Asia, You got. Chinese characters as the classical language. So that's how you write it. And it exactly corresponds. Now there's 4 cultures that constitute the. The sphere of the influence of Chinese characters. Traditionally, those 4 cultures are of course, China itself. Vietnam. Korea and Japan, so there's local pronunciations for this. Uh let's go down the list in. Mandarin Chinese. It would be pronounced. Woo all. Womans not existent or does does not exist and war is self so that's exactly like doc bag and Tibetan. In Vietnamese pronunciation. Same characters are pronounced. Volner. Vietnamese has a very peculiar creaky tone unique to it, Wagner. You can hear the tones right Vietnamese and Chinese are both tonal languages, so in Mandarin Chinese. It's a rising tone and then a dipping tone wall. And in Vietnamese you can hear similar Huh Voma. Well let's write it in Korean Script Koreans have their own alphabet. I could be wrong about this my Korean is very rusty, but I'm pretty I think it's moohah. MUA. But I know for sure what it is in Japanese. Similar sounding. Japanese also have their own silver, Berry Kana Muga Mu GA. The Dow list also had a term for the nothingness of the liberated person. It's another Chinese word meaning emptiness actually. This character here. Which is pronounced she? And that's sort of the Taoist equivalent. So, there, we have. Sort of the world of. The humility to the vanishing point. Uh as cultivated in the Western and eastern traditions.","title":"Humility to the Vanishing Point - No Self Around the World"},{"location":"expandcontract/insight-clarity-the-sensory-system/","text":"One of the themes that I have People explore in mindfulness is working with. Ordinary sense reactivity. That would be touch sight sound feel image talk. These categories naturally organize themselves into certain subsystems. I mentioned in another segment that feel image talk. Is both a reactive and proactive system? By reactive I mean when you hear a sound or you're aware of a site or something physically impacts. Your body it may or may not trigger a mental comment. It may or may not trigger a mental picture. It may or may not trigger an emotional sensation in your body if it triggers 1, two or all three of those then I say that there has been. Afit reaction of feel image or talk reaction to the IT of the touch sight or sound and it turns out that you can monitor. How your sense of subjective self the sense of being a perceiver? You can monitor how that sense of self arises through different levels of activation of feel image talk in the most extreme case when feel image and talk. All three activate very strongly in response to an external stimulus of some sort you will typically get a very strong sense of an eye that is perceiving it over there. However, as you're monitoring feel image talk. It could happen spontaneously every once in awhile that there is a touch for a side or a sound and it doesn't produce any reaction in this system whatsoever. When that happens, you have little or no sense of a perceiving self inside of you and if you monitor those fluctuations repeat this kind of experiment over and over again, you can get. Haha experience or an inside experience into the mechanism whereby the sense of I am Nahs. At least in the sense of a perceiving self arises. You can have an intense reaction of feel image talk. But if there's a lot of clarity, so that you keep those components untangled and if there's a lot of equanimity, which means that those components are completely unblocked there's no. Suppressing of their arising but there's no inappropriate holding on to them once they have arisen. That's equanimity if there's enough clarity and equanimity even though you would have a huge fit storm. A huge storm of emotionality in the body visual mental associations and judgmental chatter in your head. That doesn't turn into. Are self? It only turns into a self when there's unconsciousness and coagulations or fixation of the field image talk reactions. That's what I meant when I said that these categories can bring insights. As you're observing. Now, not only is feel image talk a reactive system. It's also proactive system when it's not reacting to touch sight sound or some combination thereof, it usually goes off, and begins to spin memory plan fantasy problem solving worrying confusion, etc, etc. Neuro scientists now know about this and call it the default attentional system. It's being studied. But I call it proactive fit. Proactive in the sense that it's not reacting to the environment. It's just going off and spinning past future and fantasy. Basically, A plus problem solving and then every once in awhile as I mentioned the fit system. Is not reactive? It's not proactive? It just spontaneously goes inactive then there's just peace? Blank quiet the body is emotionally peaceful mental screen is blank. The head is quiet if you happen to notice the moment that that occurs which may be very fleeting you will get what we call insight into no self now of course, there are some other natural systems here. We can take. Touch field to be your body experience. The ordinary side of your body experience. Then there's also a restful system in your body which is physical relaxation and emotional piece, emotional piece is defined as tangible awareness that your emotional centers are not. Active there in a restful state. There idling so to speak so this gives a system of ordinary experience in the body. And restful experience in the body then your mental experience is here, your visual thoughts and your auditory thoughts. So this is the ordinary side image talk activity. However, there's a restful system in your mind, which is blank quiet. The. Sense of outer world of sights and sounds well. That's here. The corresponding restful states are silence and the D focusing of your eyes, the soft focus with your eyes open, which I call light. One of the themes that I have People work with is different systems of ordinary experience. For example, they could focus in and just work with feel image talk or they could focus out and just work with touch sight sound. Or other combinations. And I call that theme focus on ordinary. Then by way of contrast, you can work with various restful systems including the whole thing at once. You could just let your attention freely float among whatever restful states were available, physical relaxation, emotional piece in the body mental blank saw focus of your eyes and if there happened to be quiet or silence around you. You would have an auditory component to the rest the restful states. Are what most People who don't meditate think meditation? Is an certainly releasing stress and recharging your battery through enjoying restful experience? Is is an important component in the meditative in Denver and that's why I give People these various restful systems to work on and I call that the theme of exploring rest, however. Within the mindfulness tradition, taking ordinary experience and making it extraordinary by working with it. Using high concentration sensory clarity and equanimity that's also important. Way of practicing and it's good because if you want to focus on rest. But you can't. They'll be a reason. The reason is there's too much activity well, then you can focus on the activity on the other hand, sometimes People run into this situation where when they practice. Not much is coming up so in that case? How do you keep the edge of clarity and therefore the edge of growth while I say? When nothing much is happening as you're sitting there 6 things are happening your body is physically relaxed your bodies emotionally peaceful your mental screen is blank your head is quiet your eyes are defocused and your ears are defocused so you're having 6 restful experiences all at once by being aware of that. That brings the clarity component into the experience of rest and that clarity component. Guarantees that they'll be growth in your practice that you won't get stuck in a good place of just mellowing out year after year without gaining insight and purification.","title":"Insight, Clarity & the Sensory System"},{"location":"expandcontract/intermediate-faq-how-can-i-bring-the-practice-into-my-daily-life/","text":"Intermediate students one of the very common questions is how can I bring the practice into more into my daily life? And the quick answer to that is if you want to achieve that laudable goal like any other project. You have to take measures, it's a combination of. Yes, doing enough formal practice retreat and self practice, so that there's a carryover into life. That's part of it, but then there are specific things that a person can do to assure that the practice is going to influence their day-to-day ordinary life. One of the things that you can do is you can take short moments in the day stop on a dime and begin. A mindfulness practice for 30 seconds here or 3 minutes, there when right on the fly. When nothing too demanding is happening. I call that practice in life, you can just start site. Site. Feel. Talk. Image I just start like that. The process of noting while one giving the stock OK, so doing that peppering your day with that and then the other thing is creating a challenge sequence where you take a technique and you do it seated ice close seated eyes open standing. Slow movement are slow movement in an impactful environments, then do the technique while doing a simple test to the technique while doing more demanding tasks. You create challenge sequences in your gradually work your way up until you can maintain the technique in very, very complicated. Circumstances so combination of peppering the day at least a half dozen times every day for just. Even if just for a few seconds you implement the practice on the fly that plus creating challenge sequences, which are analogous to adding more and more weights or doing more and more reps with in weight training. So you make sort of gradually pick up heavier and heavier weights. You train yourself to maintain the techniques. You use in more more complicated situations gradually so the challenge sequence? Plus, the sort of surgical strikes during the day. Plus enough momentum from formal practice those 3 taken together will allow for the practice to begin to. Inundate your entire life so there's a figure ground reversal at first. Meditation is one of the things you do in life. Eventually, you have to reach the point where life is something that takes place inside meditation.","title":"Intermediate FAQ - How Can I Bring The Practice Into My Daily Life"},{"location":"expandcontract/is-buddhist-meditation-compatible-with-other-religions/","text":"The question is often asked is Buddhist meditation compatible with other religions In other words. Can you be a Christian of a certain denomination or a moslem a Jew Hindu and so forth and still practice quote Buddhist meditation. You'll get different answers from different Buddhist teachers, but I think. If you took a consensus the answer that you would get is yes. And certainly if you were to ask me the answer would be yes, big time. Not only is it compatible with any belief system or lack of belief system. It's compatible with a rationalist. Humanist skeptical point of view, and I would say it's compatible with. Any religion that I know of including the more fundamentalist forms of religion believe it or not might think that that's a little strange, but I see it as compatible I remember. Eh. Teacher that I knew in LA. She was of the shingle in school, which is the school that I was ordained in originally as a Buddhist monk in Japan and he's the one that gave me my letter of introduction to go to Japan. His name was Bishop Takahashi. They used Bishop in English to translate a Japanese term. He was the head of the koya. San debts Eleonora Koya, San Branch Temple in Los Angelus. So he wrote me this letter of introduction that allowed me to get into the original Koya San in Japan. In 1970 to be ordained as a Buddhist monk in that tradition. One of the things I remember him, saying was that what Buddhism was about was vis-a-vis other religions was not want you to be a Buddhist. Convert to Buddhism, etc. It was about. Let's see if I can remember the exact words used in Japanese. Chi shoes regarding more jibboom known meaty of cameo. I think was what he said. This is a long, long time ago, meaning we're not interested in converting People were interested in allowing them to deepen the path they already have. And that's a very interesting perspective, an interesting way to put it after his lifetime of living in the United States teaching Buddhism. In this country and of course, encountering all the religions that already exist here that was sort of his take on it. I'm not trying to get People to be Buddhist. I'm trying to help them deepen the path there already on. And I totally concur with that way of looking at things. If you look at what is core in Buddhism? You'll see that it's about developing concentration power. It's about developing sensory clarity, it's about developing equanimity. It's about using those qualities too. Become free from ones quote ego to become free from suffering and become free from the screwed up behaviors that are the result of suffering. Certainly no one can object to this kind of core Endeavour and it would be useful. Applicable appropriate for a follower of any religion. All around the world, you'll see that there's a core mystical tradition. In each of the major spiritual traditions. Early Buddhism. Simply extracted that core essence. Then later on around that grew up a religion called Buddhism that can stand in Contra contradistinction to other religions. I think it is perfectly valid to eliminate the religious aspects of the Buddhist religion and go back to the original core, which is compatible. With or at least the original core practice, which is compatible with any religion. the Buddha believed things that are not compatible with every religion. He believed in reincarnation, he believed in the gods and so forth. He was a person of the 6th century BC his culture. So some of the Buitres believes I would not say are compatible with all religions. But one of the refreshing things about the Buddhist tradition, which makes it utterly distinct from others. Is it doesn't require a complete by and you don't have to buy the whole package. All you have to we say, Well, take what works for you. Take what works for you, if you don't believe in reincarnation than 5. Don't believe in reincarnation at least I as a teacher who has been strongly influenced by Buddhism would say that maybe other Buddhist teachers would disagree and that's fine. But I would say take the parts that work for you. I'm not alone in this regard Mister Goenka for example, a very prominent and. In some ways very traditional Buddhist teacher in the deep personal many it says essentially the same thing to everyone in their first retreat, he said. Well, you know you might not buy in the global system. Just take the parts that work for you. He has a very nice metaphor for that, if a child was eating porridge. And the child thought there was a stone in the porridge. But it was actually the cardamom spice. What would the mother do the child says I don't want to eat the porridge it has a stone the mother knows well. It's not really a stone. But the child thinks it's a soulless. Tizi citizen so fine, the mother would say just. Take it out you don't have to eat it with the stone. Maybe someday in the future. You'll that stone will have a taste for you and you'll like that. Or maybe not. Maybe you'd prefer the porridge without ever having that stuff, so I think if we take the core practice of early Buddhism and define it in terms of concentration clarity equanimity and positive behavior changes associated with those then. But that's compatible everywhere. It is possible to be a fundamentalist Christian. And be profoundly. Influenced by Buddhist practice so I would give as an example of a very conservative Christian, who was profoundly influenced in his spiritual experience by Buddhism. I would give the example of the Anglo American poet, TS Eliot. I highly recommend his poetry is a little bit heavy, but it's very deep and he was absolutely a conservative Christian. And absolutely profoundly Buddhist in his practice.","title":"Is Buddhist meditation compatible with other religions"},{"location":"expandcontract/israel-and-a-hebrew-blessing/","text":"A couple of People asked what I chanted at the end of the loving kindness today that was Hebrew. That was a Hebrew blessing. I guess you probably figured it was. He put when you heard the word. Shalom over and over again in the word is Israel is crying. So for me the word Israel. There is like Medina, Israel, there's the country. The modern nation, state of Israel. Then there's the land of Israel just what that land does then there's the Jewish people. But then when I think of the word. Israel just that word alone. I don't think of a particular ethnic group or a country or even region of the world if you go back historically where the word is. This guy L came from. It was a name given to the 3rd Patriarch. Send patriarchs 3rd Patriarch in the Jewish Linneage, who was. Well, there was Avraham, it's hot, yeah, arc of Jarco Jacob. So Jacob. Was? Try was struggled. Struggled with the forces that were making it difficult to climb the ladder to the source OK, so anybody who struggling to go up that ladder, which is all of humanity to me anyway. When I use that when I think of that word so that was a famous blessing that says Shalom bit model moth who we are says Shalom Alenu Coleus Ryan. They, in blue are Mens is what I chanted so what's cool about it is. That I won't go into a whole discussion. But the way that words are formed in in Semitic languages like Arabic, Hebrew, and Aramaic, which is the language that Jesus spoke. They are formed from Tri Continental routes typically that means there are 3 consonants that carry a general sense of meaning and then you stick vowels and other consonants in there to form verbs nouns and to make nuances of meaning so Shin Lamid. Mem those 3 Hebrew letters. They. Mean. The peace that comes through completing. Chelan means complete. And Shalom is peace that's related concepts. You complete something and then there is a piece. That comes and that's exactly how it works isn't it when you have a complete experience. There is this extraordinary piece of. The divine nothingness. That is the where, when you complete the sensory experience. It's it goes from particle to wave and then when the wave returns. To the source. In that nothingness is true absolute rest. But it's the rest. It's a rich nothingness because it has all this completeness about it and the word Nirvana. Has that sort of connotation it's like ultimate rest? Cessation but also. Total fulfillment so I gave an entire Dharma talk. In Israel on Shin Laman men taking it through many of the different permutations that it has in the Hebrew language. And this is very much by the way in the mode of rabbis. This is how they do there. They're teaching they play with the words and so forth so I was like really cool because it's like you can explain the entire practice of that arma in terms of those, 3 letters so anyway. Oh say Shalom Beamer, Oh my love. Who yeah sesh alone? May. He or that. Which creates the piece of heaven? Make peace upon you. And all is real. Cesselon beam road map. We are special own Elena upon you very end. Our call Israel. All of Israel, which is I say I understand us all of humanity. 'Cause we're all struggling to get up that ladder to the source.

Moo all the","title":"Israel and a Hebrew Blessing"},{"location":"expandcontract/jewish-mysticism-mindfulness-meditation/","text":"Last night. Uh. I gave a whole riff on the Jewish meditation tradition and I ended with. This song. Lurianic Kabbalistic concept of what a human being or a human soul is. Which I find delightful since it literally Maps 1 to one with the way that I present? The meditation techniques. If we want to define broadly. The self that would be body mind experience so in that case in terms of the standard categories. It's touch feel image talk. But then as you pay very close attention to any of those or any combination. You begin to notice the presence of change. And the more you pay attention to rates of change the more you're also paying attention to what might be called underlying forces. This is basic actually basic Newtonian physics don't have to get esoteric with quantum or relativistic invisible force fields can be detected in terms of how they impact acceleration's. As you're noticing rates of change, you get a sense that there is a kind of fundamental. Uh and impersonal doing then that sort of pervades. The physicality of the body, the emotionality of the body, the mental processes. Zen master wins, I talked about. Uh. Wait run run at love that expression. The. The true person. The authentic person. That everyone has within them. That has no fixed position. Whatsoever and I just. Screwed up started to write my own name, instead of well, same character. The true or authentic is John in Mandarin Chin in LA. In. Japanese so wait to run. Movie no shinjin in Japanese pronunciation that true person within us that has no fixed position In other words, isn't a thing, but is a doing and I'm not sure if he was rinci or another. Zen master that talked about up the invisible hand inside the puppet. And would you believe it? Some of the Kabbalistic Masters had exactly the same metaphor. As you're paying attention to. That expanding contracting vibrating field that. That moment by moment is churning. The body mind self into existence. Uh. In a cleft producing a cleft that. Within which it arises which is totally the Kabbalistic theme. You become aware that that activity wells up in subsides. It comes from one rich nothing. In other words, you start to notice how the how there's a rising. And then there's a neutralizing to a kind of nothing and then there's an absolute continuity between. The gone and the next arising. So there's a continuum. This is non dual awareness there's a continuum between the nothing the polarization of the nothing. The arising of physical, emotional and mental self. And then the reabsorption of that. Back into the Energi that then flatlines again when you reach the point where there's. Where that is an absolute continuous process? Then you're doing pretty good in your practice. And when you reach the point where that happens as your boppin around in the world taking care of business. Then you're doing really, really, really good at your practice. In fact, you're gets you up there to the Zen Master. The beginnings of the Zen master class of meditator so I have you look at? Physicality in the body emotionality in the body. The mental image is an internal talk that are the mind, then the underlying flow. And it's vanishing into the one zero because all. Almost all vanishings all zeros are uncreative equal there all the same 0. Therefore. To the extent that you're anchored in that. You your belly button and the belly button of. All of any other piece of creation overlap. And you share the same belly button, you share the same womb. And therefore you have a sense of the fraternity and sorority of all of creation would you believe it. There, according to the Kabbalistic notion of what a human being is what a soul is a soul. That's the word that often trance late. But I think it's really what a person is the soul is called neuron high. You have the physicality of the body. Then you have the emotionality a body rule. Then you have above that nasha mark, which is the mental process so that's image talk touch feel. This is image taught. Underlying all and pervading all of that is higher. The impersonal enerji that would correspond to. What I call flow but in China they might call chi and so forth? AT and it is emphasized by the kabbalists that these last 2. Even though they? They pervade the person and the person is in intimate moment by moment contact with them, They. Are not part of human they are the part that links the human? Specific to the source specifically high eyes. This kind of Energe. And, yes, he da comes from the root a hard, meaning one. It's the one the one Watt? But one nothing. The one belly button. The one zero. That is the source of the molding force. It's where it comes from it where it's where it goes back to so that's The gods that's the vanishings that I have the label so if I were to have you say OK. We're going to work in the body mind self and we're going to note touch feel image talk. And we're also going to note flow and vanishing flow, and gone.

The restful states are my reworking of the absorption practice of early Buddhism by reworking I mean, I've taken some of the principles involved in that not all of them and put them into a completely modern type of vocabulary and formulated them as a procedure. I technically refer to that procedure as focus on rest. I have People work with 6 distinct flavors of restful experience. That way the experience of restfulness or tranquility, Shamatha by the way means triangle tranquilizing's from the same root is Shaun T. That means peace. I'd like to make the experience of the tranquilizing or tranquility, aspect of the practice to be intangible and sensory. I always like to work with tangible sensory flavors that have locations in space and durations through time. So that the practice is always based in just sensory experience. I distinguished 6 flavors of rest fullness that I have People work with. One is physical relaxation of the body which I called relaxed or relaxation. Another one is what happens when you intentionally defocus your eyes your eyes are open, but you just sort of letting light in. This is used in East Asian martial arts, where it's called far mountain gazing. It's also in shamanic cultures among native People that sometimes called Spirit Eyes and it's a restful experience of the external world of Sight. You're not fixated on objects. You just sort of letting light in and it turns out actually you can process visual information better in that state. Then in the sort of fixated gaze on this, or that and that was actually used by some samurai, they would put their life at risk. They would defocus their eyes when faced with an enemy if you're going to leave that with a live blade because they found that they could respond more quickly in that une fixated visual state. So I call that light 'cause you just let him right in then I count that as one of the restful states. Then you listen to the absence of sound in different directions. The absence of sound like a sort of defocus your ears with regards to physical sound so that gives you a way of having a tranquil experience of the object of world. The body physically relaxes. The eyes defocus, the ears. D focus so you have relaxation light silence, then you can find some restful states within your subjective world. For example, at any given instant you may or may not have internal talk going now. I know you might think it's always, there, but it's not necessarily always there. And there are even ways that you can sort of turn it off without fighting yourself. In general, we don't want you to fight with yourself. But there are ways of finding quiet in your head where talk normally occurs. And it could happen that there's no emotions in your body. I call an absence of emotion in the body. You could have pain in the body without having emotion in the body for example, but emotion is things like anger fear sadness. Joy interest smile. That kind of thing. Those flavors so conscious awareness of an absence of emotional sensation in the body is an awareness of the presence of emotional piece. So I call that restful flavor of peace and that takes care of sort of the. Affective side, the emotional side of subjective experience, then we have of course thought. Well, part of thought is internal talk so if you experience quiet that's a restful state for talk space. Then you could look into your image space image space means where you see mental pictures. You could look into image space, but not at any images or maybe there wouldn't be any images there's just blank. So we'll call that blank so a restful state. In the visual part of thought. I called blind a restful state in the auditory part of thought. I called quiet and a restful state in the? Emotional body I got peace. That then gives you 6 really delicious and distinctive flavors of tranquility, relaxation light silence peace like quiet so I have People work with those and to note them to create them and note them and that's sort of. That will then take you deeper and deeper and deeper into states of high concentration and Restfulness Shamatha. Is interesting because it means the schama part means? Tranquil but the tar is sometimes taken to mean abiding. In fact, in Tibet and it's called Chinet. She means tranquil, and ambiance of I did not so than air. Part is high concentration. One pointedness andassi part is this sort of restful for tranquilizing well. There's a relationship, the way I interpret the at least part. Not all but part of the traditional Johnna system is that it's a biofeedback device. If you produce pleasant experiences, the more you focus on those pleasant experiences. The more pleasant. They become encouraging you to focus even more thus creating a positive feedback loop that Revs up your concentration power and also takes you into deeper and deeper states of tranquility, and hence the shamatha or the tranquil, but also develop concentration Top card is the high focus. That's my reworking of part of the classical system and if you look at how the classical system of the absorption's is described for example, in D kind of Kaya. You'll see that what the book that describes over and over again is going into these tranquil, States and then seeing beyond. To something to an absolute rest called Nirvana. On Euro to meaning sensation that is not. A pleasant tranquil, experience it's something beyond that, beyond time and space. But one of the classical ways to get there is to go into these tranquil, States and then see beyond them until they? Are penetrated and dissolve into? The absolute rest of the source. By giving you by making them sensory experiences, you can then observe their impermanence eventually get to their emptiness and then that becomes a path to classical enlightenment.","title":"Jhanas and 'Focus on Rest'"},{"location":"expandcontract/kriyas-complete-experiences/","text":"There is a phenomenon that comes up in meditation that I frequently get asked about. Which we call technically kriyas? Korea is a word in the Sanskrit language that could perhaps literally be translated as a cleansing. Action it comes from the Sanskrit root curve, which means to do it's actually the same root as the word Karma. Creole literally means an action, but it has a connotation of action that would cleanse one or release something release toxins. For example, in yoga. There are certain cleansing procedures that might be referred to as Korea. But as a phenomenon that comes up in meditation. It refers to spontaneous movements. Movements that just sort of happened to you, that come out of nowhere. Sometimes they're sort of small movements little shaking of the body. This kind of thing, but it can get dramatic turn into this kind of thing or in the most dramatic cases, it can involve weird grimacing and sounds. I've even had people in the most extreme cases, sort of howling like animals and. Having like animal faces and things you can sort of imagine where ideas of werewolfism lycanthropy and so forth might come about if People saw this kind of thing going on now don't worry. That's the most extreme cases usually it's just sort of rocking shaking that kind of thing, so we called these spontaneous movements kriyas typically. The fact by we I mean, the meditation teachers of the world that have some background in index systems. Now the fact that there is a technical term in from India that refers to this phenomenon tells you it's not an uncommon phenomenon and also hints that there may be underlying theory and notions about what the best way to work with it is and so forth. So when People come to me with Korea's they usually have a few basic questions 1st is going to lose my marbles and am I going to become weird? am I going to go insane is this safe what's happening. So I typically say nothing to worry about not an uncommon phenomenon. You're not going crazy. But we've got a word for it. And so you know you're not the first person to experience this. So I sort of reassure them that it's part of the path sometimes see the problem with the Kriyas is. Or the problem let's say with talking about the creators like I am now is that it's a little bit of lose lose situation. If I don't talk about it. People don't know know about it and what to do about it. But if I do talk about it. People either are afraid Oh my God. What would I do. If that happened to me or they develop Cravings. It's like that hasn't happened to me yet. What's wrong with my meditation, so the most important thing is not to develop Cravings or versions, some People experience this. Some People don't, it's not a barrier to progress. Neither is it a sinequan known for progress. It just happens to some People next thing they usually want to know is well should I try to suppress those movements or should I go with that. My advice is typically try both you can learn from both of those situations. You can learn from trying to not allow it to happen and you can learn by just OK give it permission to happen. Then the next logical question is well. Why is it happening? What does it mean here? I like to use a model that's derived from the oupa kin linneage of Burmese Vipasana in their way of thinking about this phenomenon. The there is the deep mind. The Subconscious mind, which is called the aggregate of sunk scar does or that's incense grid or in the Pali language, they're called some Cara. And these are the forces that are the habit forces within a human being can be positive or negative. Although there's a certain connotation. That being at the mercy of any unconscious force is in some ways a negative even if it's a good habit because it's a groove that drives ones perceptions and behaviors well. The model that they use is that the meditation purify's consciousness by. Breaking up these song cars by. Smoothing out the channels that constrain our behavior. These grooves, so when a groove starts to break up. It may initially percolate up to the surface as a sensation in the body. Perhaps a very subtle sensation in the body. The idea is that when you have body sensations. And you have a complete experience of the body sensation, meaning that you experience a body sensation in a concentrated sensorially clear and Equanimous State or put Alternatively when you have a mindful experience of a body sensation physical or emotional, it won't impart any grooves into the unconscious. But if you don't have a mindful experience of pleasant and unpleasant sensations. Then they will impart grooves into the unconscious and since we have thousands and thousands of sensations, everyday big and small and since most People don't have very high level of baseline mindful awareness. Those sensations are constantly. Imparting grooves song scar as well as we meditate those grooves start to break up and when they break up. They sort of reverse the process, they were imparted by sensations in the past. Now they start to come up as sensations. In the present. But before they come all the way up to surface where they can be observed and completed in the present and therefore. Their influence from the past wiped out before that happens, they may hit a kind of vulnerable area in the semi conscious part of the body and cause the body to move. Spontaneously. So that's a model for why it's a purification process what to do to optimize the purification. Well. If you can detect the sensations that underlie the urge of the body to move if you could detect them. You can have a complete experience of them and you'll discover that the body won't be driven to move. One of the reasons to explore not moving is that that may make it easier to detect the underlying sensations as they're coming up. However, it is by no means the case that you can always detect those subtle sensations that are driving the Creare movement in that case. It's OK just have have a complete experience of the Korea itself the more surface sensation of the body moving and so forth and that's the best you can do at that time and that's fine. So that's the basic model. For why these things happen and what to do about them.","title":"Kriyas & Complete Experiences"},{"location":"expandcontract/kriyas-the-cloud-of-unknowing/","text":"One of the fascinating things about meditation for me is its universality. If you think of the enormous diversity of cultures. And doctrines and philosophy's around the world. It's rather extraordinary that when it comes down to the kinds of experiences that People have when they meditate. It's More or less the same all around the world certain basic things happen that seem to be quite independent of cultures and even of the underlying doctrines and theology's and world view of the practitioners. An interesting. Case of this is with regards to the phenomenon of Kriyas. Now Korea is something that is well known in the meditative systems that come from India, or are influenced by India. It's spontaneous movements that can be at one end very mild and subtle an at the other end bizarre and intense and anything in between is spontaneous movements that are looked upon. As a releasing process. There is a Fascinating book that was written maybe in the 15th century, something like that. It was written in English, but that would mean it was written in Middle English Cha, Syrian English pre Shakespeare English. The book is called the cloud of Unknowing and you can read it in a modern English translation there been many. Made I like the one that was done by my friend father William Johnston, who's a Catholic Jesuit priest, and very long term practitioner of. Zen meditation, he's got a nice translation because he has experience is qualified. I think to translate these tags. So there's this fascinating book. It's anonymous. It's small that was probably written back in the 14 or 1500s called the cloud of unknowing? What's interesting is it's used by the Catholic Church. But it's also used by some Protestants at least the? Anglican community what we would call Episcopalian in the United States certainly makes you so that in fact, it's a kind of English spiritual classic when I was first doing meditation in Japan. When I was being trained in the early 70s at Mount Koya and I was undergoing hundred day isolation. Practice I kept that book by me actually as a kind of inspiration for even though I was doing Buddhist practice because it seemed very germane to what I was experiencing you might want wonder what the somewhat strange word unknowing means well. Unknowing is the process of having equanimity with the need to know letting go of the need to know so that you can. No in a new way an intuitive spiritual way. So very suggestive interesting title Saint Thomas Aquinas, who is the standard authority on philosophy in the Catholic Church said. I hope I'm not chopping the Latin. Too bad DM Tom compare ignore Antium Cognis Chemos. We know God directly through a very special kind of not knowing. Anyway, the cloud of Unknowing is a sort of step by step manual for how to do this. In there. There is a clear description of Korea's. Now mind you were talking something like 15th century. We're talking Western culture. We're talking a completely Christian environment. We're talking about People that. Would have known little, if anything about India? Certainly would not be at all familiar with any indic concepts regarding spiritual practice. But that book. The cloud of Unknowing has a clear description of the phenomenon of Korea's. And I just thought that's fascinating clearly the person that wrote the book was is called a spiritual director. That means he was in charge of guiding people in their meditation practice and he saw this phenomenon happening what's interesting is? That, he points out that. People have a tendency to think that. These strange movements and idiosyncratic sort of gestures and whimsical forms of behavior and whatever are a sign of spiritual progress. It's like apparently in that day. People thought that this like proves that the spirit is within you or something like that. The author of the cloud of annoying was totally contemptuous of that point of view and. Pointed out essentially what I mentioned in my first segment about the Koreas which is that the name of the game is to neither desire them nor suppress them. You just have to let them do their thing so it's just fascinating to me how. There's a kind of universality across time and space with regards to the types of phenomena that come up when we practice and also with regards to how mature or immature. People are about these types of phenomenon. They tend to be either mature or image or in similar ways. They tend to have effective ways of dealing with things or non effective ways of dealing. With things more or less similar ways. And so forth so anyway, I think you if you're on the spiritual path. You might enjoy reading that book the cloud of Unknowing.","title":"Kriyas & the Cloud of Unknowing"},{"location":"expandcontract/leonard-cohen-s-love-itself-part-2-of-2/","text":"Well, I came through the window.

At a retreat in Ithaca, NY. Leonard told me that he was going to retire from music. And then A few years later. He came out of retirement. And he came out with CD that he called 10 new songs which of course, sort of fits right there new songs he came out of retirement? And. The 5th cut on that CD. Blows me away. The whole album is dedicated to quote our teacher. Joe Sasaki, Russia. Inside the works of Leonard Cohen, which are known all over the world. Of course in the United States even more so in Canada. Where he comes from he's got a house in Montreal? Where he grew up and very much in Europe, especially France? His works are not. All over the world, but what is it known is that they are peppered with inside illusions to the teachings of Sasaki Roshi, the 5th cut on the 10 new songs. Is called love itself? And it's Leonards version of that a show or Zen talk of Sasaki Roshi unless somebody pointed out you wouldn't realize that. So Sasaki Roshi has only one talk. There is 0 but 0 is inherently unstable because it consists of all of the positive and negative in the universe. Therefore inevitably it breaks apart do expansion and contraction expansion. Only knows how to expand contraction. Only knows how to contract so in between. They create a vibration called space an that vibration is further nurtured and matured. In the cleft between them and in a evolves into a feeling thinking self that either knows it just came from zero in which case we call it enlightened self or it doesn't. If it knows where it just came from. It knows to give it the positive that it received from father back to father and the negative that it received from other back to the mother. Therefore, it disappears. There's nothing in between father and mother anymore and they come back together. To create a new? State of 0. Oh. You don't understand. OK, well, I'll try to say a little more. Then he says exactly the same thing. And then I see you still don't understand well, let me see if I can say some more. But you see each time he says it he lives it. So he could see it forever. He lives that cycle and if you sense that he's living that cycle you could you could hear him say it forever? So anyway, you're going to see in this song there's are afraid. It imitates the style of Sasaki Roshi, but there's more to it. Sasaki Roshi talks about this. Little room of space where father and mother. Vibrate OK and that's Come into contrast, you reunite come in a conscious reunited always describes it as like a private little room. Where all there's only the 2 sides of the source now? Many of you have have experienced that there are different flavors of. Flow different flavors of impermanence. I look upon the expansion and contraction as the fundamental flavors when a wave comes up on the shore. The Top of the wave is expanding the bottom of the wave is contracting and in the cleft as their shared apart is born all this Phone. So there's WAVY flow. There's Vibra Tori, flow, which is analogous to the foam. But underlying it all is this expansion and contraction. But often The most prominent experience of flow or change or impermanence is a kind of scintillating Misty bubbly kind of flow. It's very blissful often an your whole body in mind, and the external world can dissolve into and it's like trillions of Little Motes of dust. Sort of just shimmering. Some of you have had that experience. Because it's blissful. Uh. There is the danger of. Being attached to it, but if you don't become attached to that then. It all sort of. Flat lines into 0 on the little vibrations go back. To the source. Father and mother come together. And there is. Shalom Beam, Rome of the piece of Heaven. So. If having that. Champagne bubbly. Experience of flow is like? Being made love too. In a sense. What's beyond that. Is the gone? And what's beyond the God? Well, after gone. Is no place to go but? To come back. To self in world? But to see it in a different way. For having had that experience and to do this over and over and over again. Until. There is no fundamental separation. Between the Experience of the source and ordinary experience there on a continuum. There's not a duality between the deepest transcendent. Empty timeless space lus. Cessation there's not a duality between that and any ordinary experience there on a continuum. So that's living Nirvana there's nothing in between one's humanity and that which is beyond the human. And that would pretty much describe the world of a master. So there is the formless. There is the foreman, then there is. They're not being fundamentally separate. So. In the end. If you want to experience what Sasaki Roshi calls true love haunton, or I use that expression says everybody wants true love, but they don't realize. That true love is 0. True love is.

And. All indications are that it's quite trainable that the average person. Can actually learn how to do this with the proper training. There's some great websites on the Internet that will teach you how to do it. The question is if you're applying the basic mindfulness system in a dream well. What are the sensory categories that you're dealing with are the sites that you see in the dream actually to be labeled as image about the what seems to be touched and so forth is are the sounds really sound or are they talk, it does sort of makes sense as a question. Because what's going on in the dream is? Clearly, not based on external physical stimuli usually. So it's very easy, I can tell you from my own experience. Applying the The five ways working with dot sight sound feel image talk, etc. Essentially, you can consider the dreaming world to be the same as the waking world. So if it seems to you, that you're looking at an external site even though that's generated, obviously from the inside because you're dreaming you name it as site. So the dreaming world is like the waking world. There are touch sight sounds. There can be internal talk theoretically. There could even be mental images sort of images inside images in a sense, so The upshot is. That considered the dreaming world to be like the waking world and apply the techniques as you would, in the waking World Essentia Lee? What happens to meditators is that whoever they are in their waking life that so they are in their dream life. Since they are meditators in their waking life. They can also be meditators in their dream life and the same techniques that you would apply in the waking life. You apply in the dream life so it just carries over exactly. So I label the things that I see in my dreams if I'm intentionally meditating in my dream and I see something I don't label it as image, I label it as site. And it's amazing if I physically contact an object. I'll be thinking to myself and of course, that thinking is talk right. I'll be thinking to myself, OK, I'm dreaming. So I'll touch this object what happens OK well. It's touch. It seems like touch in the external world, but then, when I remember that I'm dreaming. I say to myself, Oh, but since this is dream. Actually, I should be able to put my hand through this solid object. And as soon as I have that talk. It I can OK and the solid object just sort of becomes like clay or something like that. and I could actually ghostly move. My hand through it, which I can't do in the physical world, so that is a difference. But it's still touch until it starts to behave weird but I just take that as a sign of flow OK. It's like much easier to get flow phenomenon. Normally you can't get too much flow phenomenon in touching a physical wall. You can get a little bit of it. But the site and the touch is usually fairly solidified in the waking world unless you're in a really, really deep state, but in the Dream World. At least for myself. When I remember that I'm dreaming. Then the touch and the site. Just like instantly melts and turns into flow and whatever I've also discovered. That consider smells and taste to be sort of part of touch and you certainly can get smell and taste in a dream. It could be very interesting. Actually, I was once in this dream and I was climbing this tree. And I said to myself OK. Let's let's make this tree edible. I want this tree to be made of Turkish delight. And immediately turned into Turkish delight and I started to eat like vast quantities of the Turkish delight tree that I was climbing and it was like I could taste. It was like it tasted just like Turkish delight in the real world, except it was in the dream and there was a certain degree of control because you could just think it end it sort of becomes what you want. So the point in meditating in your dreams by the way is not to play games like what I just described. The point is that when you're in the dream state you're deep in consciousness. And it's a wonderful venue to explore the standard techniques. They all worked any of the five ways. You can apply just the way you do in the waking world. You can apply it in the dreaming world and then you're making productive use of that dream time. It's optimal use of your time your getting meditation mileage out of it, so that would be my answer to that question.","title":"Lucid Dreaming and 'Five Ways' Mindfulness Meditation"},{"location":"expandcontract/meditation-teacher-s-qualifications-and-liberation-experiences/","text":"People sometimes ask how can I know? If a teacher is really qualified. How can I know if the teacher has had a liberation experience? Well, actually merely having a liberation experience doesn't necessarily make you qualified to be teaching. And not having liberation doesn't necessarily exclude you from being a good teacher. I use two criteria. To sort of. Guess whether a person has had a liberation experience or not. Notice that I said guess I can never be really sure, but I can make a pretty good. Guess the 2:00 criteria that I use our body language and personal behavior. Now the body language is fairly easy. All you gotta do is look at them listen to them and so forth. The personal behavior piece is hard because you have to hang out with them. You have to actually be there wife are there secretary or husband or a child something like that? To really know the personal behavior would have to be close to. That person over a long period of time, knowing the personal behavior is only something you can do in a relative way unless you happen to have a very special. Close relationship. Maybe a familiar with I should show. So it's a combination of sort of the flow of emptiness an impermanence expressing itself in that person's body language. Voice gays and so forth that plus their personal behavior would be the 2:00 criteria. I would look for judge levels of enlightenment. And even then I can like I say I can only guess but I can be fairly confident in that in those guesses. There is a tricky thing, though about the body language, P Saute. It interesting story, I was once. But driving in Santa Monica CA with senior student of mine. And. You know come from California, you might not know, but there's a lot of homeless people in Santa Monica and call Southern California. They sort of make it comfortable place for homeless People they're known for that, so all these homeless People there. And we saw this homeless person. And we looked at each other. And it was one of those weird psychic moments where we knew we had had exactly the same thought. And we had actually and we knew it and the thought was. If you clean this guy up. Put him in white clothes. Put him in front of an audience and don't let him say anything. But just let him. Try to do his thing. He would have something very close to the body language of something like master now that may be very shocking and all footing for some People to hear notice. I said the body language, not the mental state. Apparently, a combination of mental illness and harsh life. Had more or less driven the ego out of his body. What kind of Pseudo Enlightenment, actually but certainly not inviting you can have somebody that has the body language of no self. But not really have a classical clear enlightenment type consciousness inside of now, you see why body vive is not enough. Then there has to be the behavior OK behavior of that person was of homeless, helpless in effect ineffectual. St person living by thanking so that's not the behavior typically of a qualified teacher in terms of. Well, OK. Besides sort of. Is this person capable love dealing with the Enlightenment issue? How do you know they're qualified? Well. The very first thing that pops into my head if somebody asks me. How do you know if teachers qualified? Is look at the students? The virtue of the teacher is only in the results that that teacher can get with students as far as I'm concerned because there aren't kind of teachers that just the activity of teaching. And so what's the effect. Out of their students do somebody wants S Tony Robbins. What his qualifications were for doing? What he does? Probably may know is well well known self help speaker. And he said, because I don't know maybe there was an implication. He don't have any degree. You don't have any credibility? What gives you the right to tell People what to do and he said. Well, I have a degree in results. I like that. That's what I work for by those standards. There are some very enlightened teachers very enlightened individuals who are not very good teachers. And. There may be some teachers that haven't had a whole lot of enlightenment or. Haven't had the deep experiences of some of the Great Masters. But they get really good results with People and they can deal with anything that a student is likely to go through so I would say those are the things that come to my mind. Look for body language and maybe that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to you don't know what I'm talking about is something you develop a sensitivity to unfortunate it's a little bit of a catch 22, you don't. Sort of know what to look for until you start to become a little bit. That way yourself. Basically, what you're looking is to see is is there a flow of. Empty enerji that sort of like. Animating this person. That's the body language, but that alone is not enough because they might just be crazy. So then you have to look for behavior are they gonna mention are they in ordinary good person. And then what kind of results do they get with People, most would be some things that come to my mind, Apple quality issue of teacher?","title":"Meditation Teacher's Qualifications and Liberation Experiences"},{"location":"expandcontract/mindfulness-and-behavioural-change/","text":"One of the ways that this classificatory system can be applied is towards behavior change often when we think about meditation. We think of it in terms of achieving certain pleasant subjective states or certain wisdom insights and definitely that is a side of the meditative Endeavour. But I think that it is extremely important that behavior change object if behavior change be included in the stated goals of the meditative path. So what do I mean tangibly by objective behavior change? Well, I mean things like ones habit around food or substances if one is using? Tobacco or other drugs or alcohol and one wishes to reduce that or eliminate that that would be a behavior change eating the right amounts of the right things, etc. That would be a behavior change. One of my biggest issues behaviourally is a tendency to procrastinate and to avoid responsibilities so being more responsible. That's a behavior change. It turns out that. There's a basic principle for applying meditation to behavior change and that principle is. External behaviors are controlled by sensory events. For example, let's say that you would like to stop smoking. You decided I'm going to stop smoking. Now, what happens well, you have the urge to smoke but what's the urge to smoke. Well, Sensorially. You are having withdrawal from nicotine that creates uncomfortable touch. You feel nervous frightened irritated. That's uncomfortable feel you have. Images mental pictures of smoking. And when you have that mental picture of smoking. Again, you get a pleasant feel a smile comes on your face. You have to talk about how how uncomfortable you are. But you also have talk about well. Maybe I should start again. I really deserve it. Blah blah blah so some combination of touch feel image talk. Either pleasant or unpleasant is creating the carrot and the stick sensory events that are your urge to smoke again. The carrot part is smoke again and you'll have these pleasant feel, and your talk is telling you that and the images reinforcing it the stick part is if you keep abstaining. You're going to have these unpleasant touches and these unpleasant fields. So the urge is coming up tangibly in terms of 4 sensory events if you can. Untangle those meaning keep track of them, then they won't crisscross and multiply into a force that you cannot resist In other words, if there's 10 units of. Force in touch likewise feel image talk that is driving you to smoke again by what mathematical formula. Do we compute the aggregate force on that that is in that urge well. I would claim that if you can keep these elements distinct in awareness as they are rising in real-time moment by moment that you'll have exactly what's there 10 + 10 + 10. Plus, there. So that's 4 * 10 or 40 if you cannot do that. They will Criss Cross. Cross multiply, creating the impression of 10, * 10, * 10, * 10 or a force of 10,000 that you cannot resist. Applying mindfulness to these will reduce the power of the urge and make it easier for you to not give into that. Urge also, if you have equanimity if you open to these things. You'll discover that actually what you thought was 10 is actually just 2. Most of it. Most of the power in these things in the resistance to the things that's being multiplied saved by 5:00 in each case so really once you have equanimity so you reduce your grasping around the sensor event to 1/5 of it of what it was before now. You just got 2 + 2 + 2 + 2, so that's like. 8 and the urge is you can stay with it until it passes and you could do that over and over again until the urge doesn't come up again. So that's the basic meditative principle behind behavior change as applied to a specific of resisting the urge to reuse tobacco, but you can substitute any behavior that you're trying to get over and the principle will be the same. It will either just involve the subjective system of feel image talk or it will involve in some way touch plus. Image talk In other words, body plus mind. Now there's another basic principle in applying? Meditation in general in mindfulness in specific to behavior change. What I just described the first basic principle? Ah, which is to deconstruct the urge meditatively. If you attempt to apply that principle. It will either work or it won't meaning that you'll either achieve the behavior change. You want or you'll fail to achieve it. It is not guaranteed that met at the mindfulness alone will achieve the behavior change. So if you attempt to apply the first principle, which is see that the behavior that the object of behavior is being controlled by sensor events and then you deconstruct those sensor events with concentration clarity equanimity skills. That's the first principle if you attempt to apply that first principle and it works. Great you've done your job. It is possible that it might not work. It's insufficient. So the second principle says if that doesn't work. Then you have to go for an external accountability structure of some sort that means you have to go to a counselor. A therapist at 12 step program a sponsor a friend. A something that's on the outside. That is giving you manageable assignments in changing your behavior so you combine that external accountability structure with the continuing of your meditative approach. And that with time should get the job done for example, in my own case. One of my habits, which was a pretty deep 110 year marijuana abuse situation, literally evaporated without the tiniest structure. I'm sorry without the tiniest struggle. Literally overnight as the result of applying a mindfulness technique on the other hand, another major behavioral structure struggle that I've had in my life, which is with procrastination and avoiding responsibility. Well, I ended up having to have 18 months of psychotherapy with psychiatrist a real doctor an MD and by the way this wasn't. All that long ago, maybe I don't know 6 years ago, or so, so I needed to create for myself that accountability structure. Because the meditation alone wasn't doing it. However, the combined effect of the psychotherapy and my meditation practice was very strong stronger than they would be individually so they potentiated each other and I've been having. A lot more success with that, than I ever thought possible.","title":"Mindfulness and Behavioural Change"},{"location":"expandcontract/mindfulness-cancer-healing-1-of-3-sat-dharam-kaur-n-d-interviews-shinzen-young/","text":"I'm speaking with Shinzen Young and internationally recognized teacher of mindfulness meditation. Thank you for agreeing to speak with mission. I'm interested in your recommendations for women who have been newly diagnosed with breast cancer or are recovering from breast cancer in terms of a meditation technique that may help them both too. Recover as much as possible from the disease and help him to heal in general. But what would your recommendations be there is a vast range of possible ways that you can focus your attention. To deal with the situation of having breast cancer. Uh. But the way I like to sort of analyze that situation is 1st to frame it within a broader context. What's true of breast cancer would be true actually of any kind of cancer and what's true of any kind of cancer would be true of any disease. Or health situation. Including an injury if you are injured and had to go to the hospital in general. When one is facing a some sort of Health Crisis of any of any kind. There are 2 broad ways that People use meditation to deal with that. And those. Are not mutually exclusive? One can do one the other or both. But I think it is important to realize the relationships between them and what they are. One way of meditating and by meditating. I just mean focusing in some systematic way. So all I mean by meditating so one way to meditate or focus in a systematic way. Has as its goal to influence the object. Of course of the healing objectively. We want to diminish the cancer. We want to heal. The wound quickly right and so forth so I'd call that impacting the object of course of the healing. And there. Are a wide range of? Procedures different kinds of focuses. That are aimed at that goal. In our discussion before we started taping this interview. You talked about a number of approaches that you had studied that have history and background and so forth. If we look at them as I recall back some of them were specifically aimed at OK. We're going to. There's going to be healing. There's going to be an actual change in your situation. The cancer is going to get smaller or something like that? Could you remind me? What some of the approaches that was sort of a long one point one of the approaches was? Was the approach of Bildt Bankston? Who worked with mice and humans. But he tried to teach University students? How to heal cancers tumors in mice and found when there was students were creating images in their minds. Of positive things that they wanted in their lives and one of those images. Also being that all of the mice were cured. And that they were toasting a glass of champagne together, because all the mice were cured that that that image. Ng and the repetitions of those images as they were holding the nice for an hour a day in a cage. Allowed them to actually unbeknownst to them cure. Those mice after but a months time they thought at the end of the experiment that the experiment was a gullibility experiment. That they every few days new mice were put in the cage who had smaller tumors and they at the end of the experiment and didn't believe actually that they had cured. The mice, but it was, it was their mental state at the time that seemed to have influenced the healing with those positive images. They had this was an intentional creation of images right. OK very good, so that would be the goal are there other? Procedures that you can think of historically where the goal has been to change the object. Of course, a Doctor Mears. Ainsley mirrors from Australia. He worked in the 1970s with his patients with meditation techniques for cancer. He was also a medical hypnotist an his technique was to create a sense of relaxation have the patient created strong relaxation state stillness of mine and observation of thought. And in a very quiet quiet quiet name process of the mind without any. Real image Ng of you know, I'm going to cure this disease. Yeah, it was just to create this place of deep stillness and he seems to have had a 10% success rate in curing cancer. When this was presented to People. Was it presented as if you do this? It will have an impact on? Positive impact on your cancer that that was sort of the stated goal. I'm not I know that while they were doing the meditation there. There there were not to focus on that in their mind. I think, though, that he became known at the time for this technique. That was helping some People cure cancer. So the implication is if you do this calming an observing ticket may happen. what I would say is that I know that there's some other methods one that I think you don't think very highly of where we try to visualize like PAC man eating up the fact doctor mirrors one of his patients. Shrank her tumor by doing his technique about becoming completely still and quiet. And relaxed and he he advised his patients to dupe to practice for an hour or 2 a day. Actually, it was a long period of time. That's by the way that is a significant point. Yeah, we're not talking about a quick fix trivial. But you want a significant change. You may have to put in a significant time in Enerji and one of his patients practice his technique. Shrinker tumor and then tried the Simon Tech date. Simonton technique of actually visualizing the cancer shrinking visualizing the web. White blood cells attacking like PAC man and while she did that the tumor came back. And then she abandoned that technique upon his recommendation went back to this stealing quieting technique and the tumor shrank again so that's very interesting case very good when we look at the range of things out there very often what will be talked about is OK. If you focus in this way. It's going to cure your cancer or it's likely to hear your cancer. It's going to help bring an object of change in the situation. So I would. Consider that to be 1 basic. Model there's another paradigm another way to look at things. That. Compliments that. And can be used in parallel or perhaps in lieu of. This what we're talking about. The other paradigm says my? Interest in learning this meditation technique. Is primarily to reduce the suffering that I experience right due to this situation? And it may or may not have an object if impact. But it has a high probability. Of reducing the suffering whether it has an object of impact or not I think both approaches are equally valid. But my sort of go to approach personally if I have to teach one of the other is. I'm going to teach you ways of focusing that will reduce your suffering. The reason for that is. Several fold. 1st. A lot of in a lot of the models that you and I talked about. The. The claim is that in fact, the object if condition. Of the cancer has been caused by. Mental or emotional distress that's a claim I'm not going to comment on the validity of likely but that's Commonly believed and even in standard medison, they can be a contributing guys. Maybe not the whole cause. Yeah, I believe I could be wrong about this. But I think that the official position of the AMA American Medical Association is that mental and emotional factors weigh in. In one way or another and that's really that's established Medison. To whatever extent the object if situation is actually the result of suffering. Mental emotional what have you to that extent if we reduce suffering? Then they'll be an impact on the object of situation.","title":"Mindfulness, Cancer & Healing - 1 of 3 ~ Sat Dharam Kaur, N.D.

Is not caused by suffering or that that doesn't weigh very large that other factors are large and that? There's not a cure it doesn't get cared stay sick or you get worse. There's also the genetic factors to that, maybe just strongly weighted not in favor of a cure. That's right and what are you going to do it well by me now you can actually maybe do something with gene therapy and it would have you but my point is that even if you had gene therapy sooner or later. Someone's going to get you if you learn the techniques that reduce your suffering. Perhaps In addition to learning the techniques that are designed to specifically change the course that's why I say that the parallel. So you do whatever Interventional Medison. You do to change the course you use whatever mine focusing techniques. You can relate to or consciousness, focusing techniques better stated to change the course to actually objectively impact the disease. The health situation. The injury whatever it may be. Let's do all of that? Certainly. But there are these other things that we can do. That are. Designed to do that as maybe a nice byproduct. But they are primarily designed to reduce suffering no matter what's going on. Why do I like to start with that well number one it may have an impact objectively on the disease? 2 even if it doesn't you're OK. And since sooner or later, some something's going to happen that can't be changed often when People are diagnosed with cancer. There there in a fear state for quite awhile, so anything that will reduce the fear state is also going to be beneficial. I think you said that some of the researchers that you respect. Say that it's actually that fear state that may be a primary doctor hammer doctor hammer is a German medical Doctor Who developed a? The Medison, he calls German, new Medison, which is German, German, new medicine, which is Richard Cena Alright. I'm guessing germanism and he believes that all cancers are caused by an abrupt unexpected shock that the person has gone through that needs to be resolved and they got hammered that's right to hammerhead hammer hammer hammer shirt. I think he told him assured yes. And and it's the resolution of that shock that he believes will help, too. Promote healing. So. If we can reduce your suffering. It's good to ways. It may also reduce may also improve your object if conditions. Many People, both in the alternative Medison and in standard Madison. Would agree with that general premise? But also Just in case nothing can help this will help your physical discomfort doesn't go away. But you're suffering does. And I like the idea that a person would acquire. At least 1 technique that will do that, for them because sooner or later. They're going to need it. So let's talk about the techniques that reduce suffering so how do we suffer? Well, we suffer because of uncomfortable physical sensations. We suffer because of uncomfortable emotional sensations. Both of those are body events right. And we suffer because of negative mental images an negative. Judgmental talk so. We might say that there are uncomfortable. Physical and emotional body States and uncomfortable. Visual and auditory mental stage there in an inductor Hammers model. Those would be all there from that initial conflict or shock. They would still be there because you've got you've got the mental images of what could happen. You got the Oh my God. Oh my God, and the why me and the poor meat in your talk space. You've got the fear in your body and you've got the physical discomfort in your body constantly. Reinitiating remembering causing those 3 to Iraq to arise moment by moment by way of reactions. So you've got so let's call that that whole. Let's see is another word. German word gestalt that that whole constellation of uncomfortable sensation in the body which could be physical pain. It could be fatigue. It could be nausea could be heat. Lots of things People that right. Those are all physical type sensations, then you've got your mental and emotional reactions. So will call that whole gestalt or that whole constellation of body mind distress the sensory challenge. Meditation techniques can be divided into 2 categories. The ones that have you focus? Away from the sensory challenge. Not in a way to suppress it or deny it, but simply in a way that you're focusing away from it. Under Watt wasn't restful experiences who is it one of them? What was the nearest different kinds of cool out mellow out. You can focus away from the sensory challenge the uncomfortable body mind states. Can focus away on to pleasant restful States and we can teach you re meaning the meditation teachers in the world? Can teach you actually a wide range of different ways of focusing on pleasant restful stings another way to focus away from the sensory challenge is to focus on positive mental images positive internal talk positive emotional feelings in your body with launches. Lischen really had People to do with his suggestion so he suggested that cancer patients. Find and create the life that gives him the greatest fulfillment, meaning enjoy. And have them focus on. Making that manifest as quickly as possible for themselves and they would do that through image and talk and then they would also actually go out and create it so that for instance, there was a woman who was bedridden in the hospital who had always love. The opera so her family members brought her newspaper articles historically about the New York Opera and she wrote a book while she was in her hospital bed about the opera an lived twice as long as they sure. So one thing that you can do is focus on pleasant restful States and others. You can focus on positive image positive positive emotion. And there's even other things you can do you can anchor yourself in pleasant sights and sounds like focus on music right? All of those would be ways that you can use your attention to focus away from the sensory challenge without denying or suppressing the sensor so that's important not to suppress what you're feeling that's right so there's a whole range of strategies that I call? Focus away strategies and of course, People immediately think Oh well. If I'm focusing away. Then I'm denying or suppressing but that's not necessarily true depends on how you choose to focus away. You can focus away from it while totally giving it permission to just be there as a sensor event. But it's in the background. Then you're not suppressing but you are developing core. Focusing skills that are very useful. So that's sort of like plan a turn away but turn away in a very special way. Not in a dying or suppressing way. But in a way that sort of creates a space that this stuff can sort of breakup of it, so how long might someone have to do that, like how many minutes at a time would you suggest I usually recommend a minimum of 10 minutes that's minimum daily absolute minimum? The other range of strategies at first seems a little bit. Uh. Hard to understand perhaps. Because it's the exact opposite instead of focusing. Away from it, you will like to focus on it, but remember the focusing away is a very special kind of focusing away. It's not like Oh, I gotta get rid of this so I can focus away it's very healthy way to focus away. Now, if your attention is drawn to the sensory challenge. Uh. You can decide to just go with that and say you know what I'm going to focus on it. But there's an unhealthy way to focus on the pain. And the emotions. And the negative thoughts. There's an unhealthy way to do that, and that's the way most People probably will end up doing that. But there is also a healthy way to focus on it.","title":"Mindfulness, Cancer & Healing - 2 of 3 ~ Sat Dharam Kaur, N.D.

You've got the fear in your body and you've got the physical discomfort in your body constantly. Reinitiating remembering causing those 3 to Iraq to arise moment by moment by way of reactions. So you've got so let's call that that whole. Let's see is another word. German word gestalt that that whole constellation of uncomfortable sensation in the body which could be physical pain. It could be fatigue. It could be nausea could be heat. Lots of things People that right. Those are all physical type sensations, then you've got your mental and emotional reactions. So will call that whole gestalt or that whole constellation of body mind distress the sensory challenge. Meditation techniques can be divided into 2 categories. The ones that have you focus? Away from the sensory challenge. Not in a way to suppress it or deny it, but simply in a way that you're focusing away from it. Under Watt wasn't restful experiences who is it one of them? What was the nearest different kinds of cool out mellow out. You can focus away from the sensory challenge the uncomfortable body mind states. Can focus away on to pleasant restful States and we can teach you re meaning the meditation teachers in the world? Can teach you actually a wide range of different ways of focusing on pleasant restful stings another way to focus away from the sensory challenge is to focus on positive mental images positive internal talk positive emotional feelings in your body with launches. Lischen really had People to do with his suggestion so he suggested that cancer patients. Find and create the life that gives him the greatest fulfillment, meaning enjoy. And have them focus on. Making that manifest as quickly as possible for themselves and they would do that through image and talk and then they would also actually go out and create it so that for instance, there was a woman who was bedridden in the hospital who had always love. The opera so her family members brought her newspaper articles historically about the New York Opera and she wrote a book while she was in her hospital bed about the opera an lived twice as long as they sure. So one thing that you can do is focus on pleasant restful States and others. You can focus on positive image positive positive emotion. And there's even other things you can do you can anchor yourself in pleasant sights and sounds like focus on music right? All of those would be ways that you can use your attention to focus away from the sensory challenge without denying or suppressing the sensor so that's important not to suppress what you're feeling that's right so there's a whole range of strategies that I call? Focus away strategies and of course, People immediately think Oh well. If I'm focusing away. Then I'm denying or suppressing but that's not necessarily true depends on how you choose to focus away. You can focus away from it while totally giving it permission to just be there as a sensor event. But it's in the background. Then you're not suppressing but you are developing core. Focusing skills that are very useful. So that's sort of like plan a turn away but turn away in a very special way. Not in a dying or suppressing way. But in a way that sort of creates a space that this stuff can sort of breakup of it, so how long might someone have to do that, like how many minutes at a time would you suggest I usually recommend a minimum of 10 minutes that's minimum daily absolute minimum? The other range of strategies at first seems a little bit. Uh. Hard to understand perhaps. Because it's the exact opposite instead of focusing. Away from it, you will like to focus on it, but remember the focusing away is a very special kind of focusing away. It's not like Oh, I gotta get rid of this so I can focus away it's very healthy way to focus away. Now, if your attention is drawn to the sensory challenge. Uh. You can decide to just go with that and say you know what I'm going to focus on it. But there's an unhealthy way to focus on the pain. And the emotions. And the negative thoughts. There's an unhealthy way to do that, and that's the way most People probably will end up doing that. But there is also a healthy way to focus on it.","title":"2 even if it doesn't you're OK."},{"location":"expandcontract/mindfulness-cancer-healing-3-of-3-sat-dharam-kaur-n-d-interviews-shinzen-young/","text":"So to describe the unhealthy way the unhealthy way is that you don't have precision about what's happening where? And. You're constantly fighting with whatever's happened they might be saying, I'm going to get rid of this. I gotta get rid of this again. It's like no, I don't want this and you tighten around it. Mentale an emotionally OK, so you're fighting with it at many levels of your being both on the surface and then the depths and you're not precise about exactly what's happening where when? That's an unhealthy turning twords the sensory challenge. So you're feeding it in a way by doing that. That's a very good way to put it, it's feeding the fire. Now, most People think well if I focus on it, I will automatically be feeding. The fire fight focus on it, the worse. It's going to get however, that is profoundly not true. If you've been trained in systematic techniques. The systematic techniques will teach you how to? Untangle the components of the experience so they don't multiply into overwhelm you'll learn how to separate this part is the physical body. This part is the emotional body. This part is the visual thought this part is the. Auditory the mental talk. Let's say that a person comes to you and they say I'm suffering at level. Or you say what's your suffering? How much are you suffering right now. And they say I'm suffering at the maximum possible what's that number, they say well. 10,000. OK. It's 10,000 it's like totally over the Top. Maximum possible human suffering. That's because they are turning towards the discomfort. In an unskillful way. If they were to turn their attention towards the discomfort with the discipline skill. That allows you to separate. The components. OK, what they would discover is that that number 10,000. Is a rising due to 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 because all those 4 channels are on to it? Not because they're all on. But because they're all on and their crisscrossing and multiplying with each other? How do you separate? The channels and go to one at a time. How would someone do that in meditation. We use a technique called mindfulness that will teach you. In a discipline way out of focus on each one individually. So you tease them out and then when they happen collectively. Instead of 10, * 10, * 10, * 1010 times, Tennis Endered, another 10, * 10, is another hundred 100, * 100, is 10,000 right so you kind of pull apart that gets dropped in it's no longer addition, alt it's just. For things. And your perception is now exactly what is there? 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 and they're all in one at a time well. You first learn how to have them one at a time, but then you can hold them all at once. But it still just 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 rather than 10 * 10 because now their separate even when they're happening all at the same time, so do the math. If we say that without changing your sensory experience at all. But by merely changing your ability to separate it into its natural atoms. If we were to say to a person I'm going to take you from suffering at 10,000 to suffering 40. I'm going to take a \u00a310,000 weight off your chest, but you will have to carry 40 pounds. Sounds like a deal it's a big reduction, I mean that's a. It's from it goes from. Hopeless overwhelmed, too, OK, I can handle it, and how do you would you suggest they deal with it if say they're feeling the feeling? What do you have to do? They have to be trained in specific exercises In other words, it's not so much. I'm going to now describe to you. In 2 minutes and you're going to be able to do it. Yeah, you. You have to find a teacher or listen to a CD that teaches those techniques and you just follow those exercises. And so I guess that you know, I would say well. How do you get strong the quick answers go to the gym and do the Nautilus cycle but you have to actually go and have somebody show, you how to do. The Nautilus Cycle. So you need a person or an interactive website or to teach you how to do that. But I'm giving you the theory right so the theory says divide and conquer. So there's a way of focusing on it where you first break it up into its components. Now you've gone from 10,040. That's pretty good. That means 10 + 10 + 10 + 10. Now let's look at each one of those 10. Is there really 10 there? Or. Is there really one there? That's being multiplied by 10:00 because of resistance so that's interesting. And it turns out, it's going to be the going to be that so now we train away the resistance, the. Learning to tease out the strands is the part of mindfulness that is sensory clarity. The training away. The resistance is the part of mindfulness that is equanimity. You also need concentration power, so you can focus on one strand at a time in order to. Be able to learn about each one so we teach your concentration clarity and equanimity that allows you to separate the strands and then reduce the resistance to each strand so now we've gone from 10,000 to 4, which essentially? Says that for all intensive purposes. We have illuminated you're suffering even though the physical pain. The emotional sensation and the thoughts and the mental talk are still there. They're still there. They're not in the way. It's a miracle it's hard to believe that this could happen. We call it the miracle of mindfulness. That's a healthy way. To bring your attention to it. And it's very fortunate for us, human beings that that strategy exists. 'Cause you may attempt to turn away on to something restful positive rounding. And you may find your camp do it, it's just so much in your face, saying do it. Then you've got this other way of work. Just to recap get the big picture if you have a health situation and he would like to use your focus power to deal with that. Be clear. Am I using it to change the situation objectively. Oramai cultivating a skill that broadly reduces suffering and may change, it, the object of situation too. Or am I doing both. I would suggest that a person can do one. The other. Or both. But I would. Hope that they not do neither and there's one other technique do either is another technique that I think we haven't mentioned that much, which is focusing on the positive. As a part of the what you've just elucidated so that would be that would come under the category of focus away focus on the positive comes under the category if by positive you being positive mental images mental to remind me again of build Bankston's recommendations to people with cancer was to focus on seeing themselves well doing whatever they're doing because they will so there's no focus at all. On the cancer is shrinking cancer but it's visualizing themselves doing what they would be doing. Most happily in their lives because they're completely well very good, so I think we've pretty much covered the field. Thank you so much. That's very, very helpful. My pleasure and you have a website that People can link to to help with. Learn all this stuff. Yes, yes, they can go to basicmindfulness.org it's all there.","title":"Mindfulness, Cancer & Healing - 3 of 3 ~ Sat Dharam Kaur, N.D. Interviews Shinzen Young"},{"location":"expandcontract/mindfulness-factors-and-tastes/","text":"Each of those, 3 components grows. On average overtime. In specific at a specific time. You could have. A certain critical mass of concentration clarity and equanimity with regards to a specific experience. And then that experience would become paradoxical it would be. So fully present that it was absent, but it might be a fairly small experience and that might happen only sporadically. On some days on some occasions certain experiences. You get the sense of. As it arose it completed so it never constellated into thing and when you look back and ask yourself. Why did that happen? Well, there was an extraordinary degree of concentration clarity and equanimity? You know for those few seconds or for those few minutes with regards to this phenomenon typically that occurs initially with regards to pain in the sith that quote breaks up. It's sort of still there, but it's not really there. That kind of thing is what I meant by critical mass. Looked in the large picture, though over months years decades of practice. There is sort of hockey stick growth curve for all three of these elements, however, that growth curve has local fluctuations of peaks and valleys. Some days, it's your mindfulness factors are more evident other days, there less. In the small picture, but then there's the large picture. With regards to how you taste each of these that's a very good question. Concentration has its own taste. It's impossible to describe in words. But once you experience it. You know what it tastes like. It's the in the zone taste OK, but how do you describe that taste to someone it's been fairly credibly scientifically documented the taste of concentration in and of itself is sensorially fulfilling. This comes out of the positive psychology work that was done in Chicago by Mike Chick sent me high and others. So it has its taste than you know you can taste it. Equanimity has its taste, but it's impossible to really describe in words you develop a taste for it. If I had to put it in the words, but this doesn't really. Do it, but it's sort of like it's a knowing that because of the open way that you're experiencing this moment every moment of your future will be more fulfilling involved less suffering and you're also releasing stuff from the past. Some part of you knows that as a quantum eyes is some present sensory phenomenon that's the taste of equanimity. So what's the taste of sensory clarity. One is Untangle ING. You. Say work with feel image talk individually collectively and there comes a time when you get a big fit storm. OK, a big storm of it arises. And because you have so much momentum of clarity, those elements don't get mixed. They're just they have all three are happening simultaneously, but they are intrinsically. Untangled in the arising and that's one of the tastes of clarity. It's an unmixing flavor. I don't know how to describe it. It's a D conflating which then. Uh. Removes. There flooding effect that People get when many sensory phenomena are activated simultaneously. They're all still activated at once, but somehow there, not tangling with each other. And when that reaches a critical mass self as thing goes away it just like evaporates. So if you have a knot of flat screen, but conventional TV monitor that's a CRT. 2. Uh. So you look at it. And let's say that it's showing a white pattern and I make the claim. There is no white on the screen. It's an illusion. You say I'm crazy just look there's white anybody can see I say, Oh yeah, there's a magnifying glass. We agree this does nothing but resolve makes. Clearer things that are falling together in tank it untangles visual experience. So at some point. The perception white goes away and the perception red, Green Blue arises. Was there ever any white there? That sensory clarity. It's resolution power it's hi rez. Higher and higher death. The other direction that the sensory clarity goes is the ability to pick up faint during features signals. Which is a power thing? If you have signals that are very low power. Very subtle. There's a dimension of clarity. Regarding the ability to detect those. My favorite shibboleth subtle is significant. So the flavors of sensation. That. Drive day-to-day perceptions and behaviors of human beings. Most of them are initially below the threshold of awareness. With practice. They percolate up to specificity so you're able to detect finer and finer arisings, meaning that you're less and less likely to be hijacked by subliminal. Images talked and especially by subliminal field In other words, Subliminal Fenomena very faint arisings have a huge impact on the subconscious. On the subconscious without the conscious knowing. This is the main difference between one of the main differences between the way that the subconscious is considered in western psychology and the weights considered in eastern psychology. In the instance psychology it. There's a lot to it, but one of the dimensions that differs is you're interested in. Making the real-time subconscious events. That our sensory subconscious events. You know specific emotional flavors. Mental images talk that's very fated very subtle that's arising in the background. That. Becomes. Perceptible through developing sensory clarity, so you're not hijacked by that during the day. There's a third dimension. Which is speed of detection? Site. Site. Feel. Already. Already. Side. Feel. You notice that. I could start on a diet. Site video. There's no like OK, I need 5 minutes to sort of be with my breath, and then I can sort of figure out what's going on no no emphatic Lee now? Feel. You got to be able. To do it instantly right in the thrust of any activity start on a dime. So it's the ability to also immediately detect. Do not have to like you know the typical well, I'll sit I'll sit for 10 minutes and then I can figure out what the Hell's going on inside of me no it's gotta be. All rest. Touch. Anytime anyplace. 1/2 of US quarter of a second you're off and running why. Because in a half a second. The terrorists are in the cockpit. So. Ah, maybe the speed of detection is another clarity. I'm thinking as I'm sort of obviously making it up as I'm going but so the resolution piece. The. The ability to detect subtle things and the ability to immediately be mindful. Without having to sort of get grounded or whatever People do, maybe those are the 3 dimensions. But growth in the clarity.","title":"Mindfulness Factors and 'Tastes'"},{"location":"expandcontract/mindfulness-psychotherapy/","text":"When Buddhism, Went from India into China, it encountered the indigenous culture of China. And the indigenous philosophes of China through the. Cross fertilization of Indic Mahayana Buddhism. And the Taoist Confucian culture of China was born. Uh. A new direction in Buddhism, called Chan or Zen. There is historically. Precedent for Buddhism, coming into a culture and interacting with what already exists there to produce interesting new results. Now we have Buddhism coming into the Western world. All 3 vehicles of Buddhism mindfulness practice, which is representative of the small vehicle. Zen, which is representative of the large vehicle and the Tantric practices, which are representative of the diamond vehicle. It's all coming here and we would expect that it would interact with Western culture. Many facets of Western Culture, one of them is neuroscience and another one is physics. Those are areas of particular interest. But there's also the religious interactions specifically with Christianity, primarily Catholicism and with Judaism now. Then there's the interaction that it is having with psychotherapy. 100 years ago, William James predicted. That. Within 100 years, Westerners would be learning their psychotherapy. From Buddhists. An amazing prophetic. Statement because at this point in history. I would say that the dialogue between mindfulness practice and western therapy. Is? Central to therapy. It's not just some marginal thing that's being done by a few people with special interest. It's like it's the hot topic. Which is an utterly amazing because I can remember reading books? When I was a kid in the 50s books by psychiatrists. And so forth who basically pathologized Buddhist meditation considered it to be a form of mental illness. And now You know within 50 years. We're talking about major influence from Buddhism into therapy, particularly from mindfulness into therapy, particularly into the more hard. Nosed forms of therapy like cognitive behavioral therapy. This is just amazing that this is occuring so it's a natural question. What is the relationship? Between these 2 modalities. It's V question these central question that is now being investigated. We don't have the answers yet, but I can make some conjectures if I had to summarize the difference. I will with an oversimplification. I would say that in some sense. Western therapy and mindfulness practice. Seemed to be rather similar at least if you look at the key concepts and the buzz words. There both in favor of being aware as opposed to being unconscious. They both want you to be aware of the influences from the depths that may be influencing the surface. Now they both ask you not to hold an inappropriately to things from the past. But to move forward into the present. Without holding complexes from the past they both ask you to not be conflicted not fight with yourself. They both talk about having a hard experiences inside experiences and so forth so from a certain perspective. They seem to hold rather similar ideas. Where I would say that the primary difference? If I were allowed to over simplify things. Is that although the ideas are the same? Or roughly similar let's put it this way. Mindfulness practice implements those ideas at a much finer timespace scale. And at a much more intense level. So that Mindfulness practice. Has a quantitative difference? And that quantitative difference is so great that it leads to a qualitative difference. So similar type things but. At a very fine time scale second by second. The Holdings that you let go of in mindfulness practice. Our second by second inappropriate Holdings as opposed to the Holdings that you let go of in psychological practice, which is from last year or last decade or your early childhood or so forth those are sort of Macro Holdings. Mindfulness asks for letting go of Micro Holdings, the clarity that you're asked to develop in mindfulness is moment by moment ability to resolve experiences into feel image talk and to resolve the feeling too. A spectrum of flavors and resolve the flavors into individual location arisings. It's a whole. Other level of being aware of what you're experiencing or quote knowing what you're feeling in that moment, it's like. Totally different level of resolution and detail and the way of reaching the unconscious difference. Typically, in psychotherapy, I call it the dredge up. You just approach. You sort of reach down and you dredge up 1:00 or 2:00 important pivotal things to look at whereas in mindfulness practice. It's a trickle down the awareness trickles down through all of consciousness and the subconscious rewires itself without the surface, even needing to know and that's global. That's throughout the entire T of consciousness. So I would say roughly speaking that that the basic. Ideals are the same but because mindfulness implements them at a more finer scale and with much greater intensity. This is a quantitative difference. That leads to a qualitative difference. However, the differences are complementary one needs to know the brick and mortar structure of the building. In addition to knowing the atomic structure if you just know the atomic structure. You don't have the whole picture. You need to know gross anatomy as well as cellular Histology. So the 2 pictures pictures compliment for the large structure of personality and behavior. That's the specialty of psychotherapy for the transcendence of limited existence an suffering for insight into the nature of all. Cells. As opposed to insight into the nature of a particular self. For understanding the nature of all self. Mindfulness is the specialized vehicle. So. It's good, they complemented each other, they give different scale picture of the same phenomenon. So you get the big picture, the gross anatomy, so to speak clarified and the behaviors dealt with with the therapy and then you get the micro structure. The spiritual essence dealt with mindfulness and you have a perfect complementarity.","title":"Mindfulness & Psychotherapy"},{"location":"expandcontract/mindfulness-the-categories-of-sensory-experience/","text":"This is how I like to classify basic sensory experience. When I have People learn mindfulness techniques. I have them note their experience based on these categories. This system was designed with 2 goals in mind. One is that it would tend to lead to insights in meditators because they can see how these different sensory systems interrelate so that's sort of a pragmatic. Point of view that it's convenient for People, having a hard experiences when they track their sensory events. The other goal was to create a system based on contrasts that would be convenient for study with what's called fMRI that's functional magnetic resonance image Ng? When you Study the Neural Corlette of experience with fMRI. You can't actually image and experience that you can do is image to contrast ING states. So I gave a lot of consideration as to what would be the most useful contrasts both in terms of image studying that scientists might want to do and in terms of what's likely to? Bring about insight experiences for the meditators who are being studied by those scientists so with those 2 goals in mind, I created this system. I call it the basic states. The. Right left gives you a contrast between a more object if side of experience versus a more subjective side of experience for example. There are external physical sounds in the world, but there's also the internal sound of your self talk, sometimes when external sound expands internal talk might go away, and you can watching that contrast, you can see some interesting interactions. So this would be in an auditory domain. I'll get these guys in a minute analogously. There are external sites in the world. But there's also the internal visual experience of your mental images when you're thinking of People places physical objects. When you have memory plan fantasy or your eyes are closed, and you think about where you are or how your body appears. You're having visual thoughts so image is the more subjective side and the external sites are the more object of side of visual experience. Then there is somatic experience In other words, body experience I. Believe that it's very important that People. Develop the ability to detect when their body has emotional type sensations. When a person experiences. Anger fear sadness embarrassment impatience disgust interest joy. Love gratitude humor smile and so forth. There are usually body sensations, distinctive body sensations associated with that, so the real juice of emotional experience I would claim is not so much in the internal talk and mental image. Although that of course, is important. But it's the emotional type sensations that give the strong valence or coloration or power to emotional experiences. So I think it's good that we have a word in English. That means body sensation. That seems emotional to a given individual at a given time. There is no such word that has that meaning in English. Neither is there any such word in any language that I'm familiar with so arbitrarily assigned the word feel to mean affect if so, Miss Thesia that would be a very fancy way of saying. Emotional body sensations affect if is Latin phrase, meaning emotional so much. Thesia is body sensation body experience. So I use feel for that and that would represent a somewhat subjective side of the body relative to touch, which is. Everything else all the other ordinary experiences in the body itches and aches pressures and pains sleepy sensations or ordinary breathing ordinary pulse. That kind of thing is more of an it if you have pain take that as a touch if the pain causes. Anger fear sadness those reactions. Those body sensations. I would call feel and in point of fact feel image talk. Represent a reactive system, they can react to. Touch sight sound there also a proactive system. They can go off on their own and spin memory plan fantasy and so forth you have a fundamental contrast between auditory visual and somatic. And then across here, you have a somewhat more object if side and a somewhat more subjective side. Now 1/3 level of contrast is between the ordinary sensory activity. Touch sight sound field image talk and corresponding restful states for example, when you're focusing on external sound it might happen that there's not any sound. That's an interesting experience that's a restful state and you can note that as silence. What's even more interesting is if you happen to be focusing on internal talk and it goes away well. I have a term for that experience I call that quiet. So. You have some restful states here. If you don't have any images you can be aware of mental blank. Or even if you have images there's a way that I teach People to focus on a background of blank. You can defocus your external site your eyes are still open, but you just sort of letting light in. And that's a restful state corresponding to external site that's used by many different People summer I for example, used to intentionally solve focus their eyes in practicing martial arts, so that's another restful state. The contrast with site. I call that light and then contest resting with touches the physical relaxation of the body and contrasting with feel is its absence, which I call? Emotional piece so this gives us a contrast between. Somatic visual auditory. A contrast between Subjective reactive proactive versus objective experience and then a contrast between ordinary experience and corresponding pleasant restful states. So these are the basic States and I build different mindfulness systems based on the states.","title":"Mindfulness & the Categories of Sensory Experience"},{"location":"expandcontract/mt-carmel-talk/","text":"Teachers can't avoid making bad karma either.

The Medison then becomes the poison there's lots of different ways, you could define enlightenment. One way that will help you, perhaps be disabused of the comparison mind. I'd like to tell this story. Most of you have heard this story. Many years ago, I and another American Buddhist monk and a Japanese and Roshi. The 3:00 of us were interviewed for Japanese television, the interviewer asked me the question's authority to lie dine on this car. Now you might know the word Satori. That means enlightenment in Japanese waking up when you get right down to it. What is it like I turned to the other American monk? Who is more senior than myself. And he sort of turned to the Roshi. So that got passed onto the Roshi. This is my zoomy. Roshi, who's lineages very prominent in North America. Here you are a roshi. Presumably you know what it like my dad said, but now it's for the record for the Camera for half a million People that are watching on television forever, you're on the spot. Satori toy dine on this car when you get right down to it, what is it like? So. Migos. So. 30 to Saturday, then I don't know. I guess you could say. It's the disappearance of the distinction between Enlightenment and modded like Monday. Meaning. As soon as you start thinking? What am I going to get enlightened. Why is this one more enlightened than me? Why have and I experienced this? What am I doing wrong you are making a distinction between Enlightenment and not in line with the quickest or to enlightenment right then and there. But you know what it is. Stop making that distinction if you keep that in mind, then People like me won't make so much bad karma. By telling you all sorts of distinctions. As you Give nature half a chance. To gradually nurture your concentration clarity and equanimity skills. Over the weeks months years. For the duration there is a good probability that at some point. Those that triple skill set my definition of mindfulness will reach a sufficient critical mass so that if you chose to work with the theme of expansion and contraction in your senses. If that was something you wanted to do. Uh. But that would be available to you if you read the classic text on the posener or mindfulness meditation. the V Suit Di Maka. It means the path of purification. It was written by put to Cosa. I don't know. Maybe in the 5th century AD and Shree Lanca written in the Pali language. There are some translations. It's not an easy read that's for sure. Even in translation in any event, you will see he describes A. A point in one's development. Not very rather close to. The experience of stream entry or? Initial insight enlightenment, if you will. There's a time when your awareness becomes. Dominated by the pattern of rising and passing rising and passing. That is to say things well up and then things subside. At a somewhat later stage. You be cut your attention becomes dominated by the pattern of no sooner does it start to arise but it's already passing? As soon as the time space volume that a sensory event would occupiers arising that time space volume is simultaneously collapsing. In other words. Simultaneous expansion and contraction. And then there. There. Neutralization. Into 0. Is already explicitly described in the pali literature? I am quite sure Sasaki Roshi never read those passages, he just. Experienced it in his own practice, but instead of describing it as something over there that you're where things are dying as soon as they are passing. Which is sort of like linear OK or 2 dimensional? He sets it up in this 3 dimensional paradigm. Where? You're not observing the simultaneous. Welling the simultaneous birth and death of space, you're not observing it that would put you in some space over here fixated. You're not observing it fixated The Observer is arising in the sphere itself. That just means feel image talk and touch the and the world. Your body mind and your sight sound. If you want to cut it up that way body myself and the sight sound world. There they are arising. Both inside that time space volume that that is molding them. Through expansion and contraction. That means that. Uh. As you bop around in the world as you look here, you look there. You are participating in. The activity of impermanence you're participating in the source you're not observing the source participating in the source. And maybe that's one of the different one of the differences between Zen training and Vipasa 9. Pipasa not you sort of observe impermanence and then if you do that long enough.

They are a rising moment by moment in between expansion and contraction. Therefore, they are not fundamentally separate from the source.

And I talked a little bit about how the term witness or witness consciousness is used. Now I'd like to say a little bit about nondual. This is once again, possibly an ambiguous phrase one might say that a non dual awareness is an experience of the Oneness of subject and object from that perspective. Actually, there are a number of ways that non dual awareness can occur. One of them is that there's a touch or a site or a sound that arises and there's no feel or? Image or talk reaction to it, so there's just that touch or that site or that sound without a sense of an observer separate from it. And so there's an experience of being that touch or that site or that sound in the yoga sutras that's referred to as? Sabi just Samadi. Merge somebody in the sense of merging but there's a seed there Savija, the seed is that there's a thing merged with. A deeper experience of. Oneness with some People might call non dual awareness. Occurs when not only does the field image talk? Reaction. Not arise. But the touch sight sound itself. Arises but it never fixates it just becomes a flow. And if any feel image talk arises. All it also is just a flow and the 2:00 flows merge and become a single wave. And then that wave dies down into nothing into 0. The touch sight sound world in the field image talk self. Arise as an interacting wave on fixated. In between expansion and contraction. They just sort of vibrate and Interpenetrate and then when they die away in that nothingness is the Oneness of subject and object or the true observer. From a certain perspective. So some People might call that non dual awareness because there's not in an absolute sense subject and object have been transcended. Potentially calls at near be just some anti or merging without an object that is merged with another words of formless merging. In some Zen lineages. It's called Rio more DO means both and more means disappeared will subject and object of disappeared into. The one Nothing. However, personally I would prefer to use the phrase Nondual awareness, to refer to something else. Something. More. Ambitious. Then. The things I've just described which are already very ambitious just to have the experience of just hearing or just seeing that takes quite a bit of training typically to have the experience of formless merging near BJ's Samonte audit training. What's more ambitious than that, well, What's more ambitious than that, and what I would. Personally. Like to use the word non dual awareness for. Is? The. Habitual. Abiding. In. The cycle. Of. 0. Polarization zero polarization over and over and over again, so that sounds very abstract. What do I mean by that. OK, so let's say that you have that experience or not exactly you have that experience there is the experience of. Both disappearing into 0, both the object of world and the reactive. World of thought and feeling. They've become a wave and that those 2 waves of merged and they flat and into a oneness that is a nothingness. And you are that nothingness that is the true self, AKA the no self. What's next will that nothingness is going to break apart? At once again polarize. And in the cleft. Self and world will regenerate. When the self and world reappear. If you realize where they've just come from. Then the self and world are not fundamentally separate from that 0. Their arising innocence inside 0. And there is very quickly return to 0 and then the next arising arises sort of inside zero and there's a return to 0, so that you go through your day. Hundreds and hundreds of times a day, having an experience of touching the timeless the 0. And then Time being bored, but not really the fundamentally separate the umbilical cord that connects to the 0 is not completely severed. So you're born but not really born and your world comes into existence, but not really because it's still in folded in the 2 sides of zero and so you come in the words of the Neo Platonist. Philosophers of Western Antiquity. You come from the good. Return to the good without ever really leaving the good in any fundamental sense. Then this is non dual in the sense that there's not a separation. Between. Source and and the daily life that's born from source so you're just bopping around in the world doing what anybody does, but you end your world are born but not really born so there's not a. A fundamental cleft from a practical point of view between the transcendent and the ordinary. And so there is not that's the real non duality as I would have it creator and creation that duality has been seen through so a person that in terms of Zen Oxherding Pictures that somebody that is firmly mounted on the ox can never be bucked off the ox. No matter what life throws at them, so you're writing this. Powerful ox called consciousness or emptiness or source or God or nature and you can't be bucked off.

Who is a compulsive eater? Overcomes their eating compulsion. They don't stop eating. They continue to eat, but they eat in a different way. It's not driven. And it's healthier. With regards to our. Mind. The mind has a certain drive. To find meaning. That drive I think is in some way intrinsic to the image talk circuits themselves. But also is linked to feel. If we can't define Feliz emotional body sensation. When the mind finds meaning. You'll find a smile on your face. Aura Rosiness in your chest or a free song, a kind of ripple of pleasant excitement through your body. When the mind fails to find meaning. When the mind is confused muddled spinning to no avail. Then you'll find in the body sensations of fear and tear. And impatience agitation and so forth. So. The drive to find meaning involves I believe a certain intrinsic drive in the image talk circuits. 2. A stab Lish pattern. And then some juice in the body, particularly with regards to the pleasure associated with. Finding answers and the discomfort in the body associated with being confused or not having answers, especially fear and. Sadness flavors. So some combination of forces within feel image talk drive us to have meeting. We can train ourselves into equanimity with don't know. It's a systematic training. The medieval Christians called the Doctor Ignorantia or trained. Ignorance. The ancient Greeks call that epic E. Apple Hey in their pronunciation meeting to suspend suspend what suspend the need to have answers. Inzan it's called don't know mind. This can be systematically trained. Meaning that when can systematically work through the forces? In image talk and feel that drive us to have meaning. Now, why is it? Why is it important to do that? Well, I would say several reasons. For one thing inevitably we will be faced with. The inability to find meaning. Every new thing we know raises new questions so our don't know grows faster than our do know. By our I mean, the human species, so we have to. Except the fact that will always be facing don't know, and in fact, a major theme in modern mathematics and modern physics. Is the limits of? What even can be known or at least known in certain ways? Google's Undecidability underside ability and incompleteness theorems heisenberg uncertainty in. Physics and so forth point us directly to don't know. In fact point could be made that. The stability of the known universe in that it depends on Heisenberg. Uncertainty depends on God's equanimity with don't know. Anyway so sooner or later we and probably God are faced with don't know I'm being somewhat. Metaphorical and humorous. I think you understand on the theoretical level and then on the practical level, Hey, we're going to get old. Or Gonna and as we get older our mental faculties. Deteriorate I can see for myself. I'm 65 and I can see it's downhill. I'm past my intellectual peak. But that doesn't freak me out because I have made friends with don't know I've made friends with my own impending stupidity. There was a famous 20th century mathematician that I like a lot. It was quite eccentric named Paul air dish. ERDOS is how you write that name and he wanted to have put on his gravestone. I don't know if they actually did it, but what he said put on my gravestone. Is at last? I'm not getting stupider anymore? So I can see I'm sort of getting gradually getting stupider, but that's OK, so theoretically and practically sooner or later. We have to face don't know there is a need to deal with the need to know and Fortunately. There is a way of doing that. The other reason why it's good to be able to deal with don't know is that? As you remember on the metaphor of the compulsive eater when the compulsive eater has worked through their compulsion to eat it? Don't stop beating in fact, they eat in much more fulfilling new way. When a human being works through the need to have answers. They don't stop having answers. They start having answers in a deeply fulfilling an radical new way. That's why Christians in the Middle Ages and the Greeks in classical antiquity. At least some of them cultivated this and it's the basis also for the Zen koan practice is like? What's the sound of one hand and so forth. This new way of knowing. We have a name for it. We call it wisdom function. So both because we don't want to suffer. Due to the fact that don't know is inevitable. And also on the positive side when we work through the need to know we get to know in a radical new way called? Insight or if you wish wisdom or even in its morgue most extreme form enlightenment. For these reasons. There is a need to work through the need to know.","title":"Not Needing to Have Answers & the Wisdom Function"},{"location":"expandcontract/noting-1-of-2-parts/","text":"Here's how I like to conceive of the structure of the note 8. There's A rhythm that is set up. Of Acts of noting each act typically but not inevitably consists of two parts a brief moment of clear acknowledging. That some sensory. Category or some sensory event is present, so that's that cleared knowledge ING and then there's a few seconds of intent focusing. The main exception being that sometimes as soon as something is acknowledged it immediately disappears so there can't be that few seconds of intent focus. In that case, and in fact, as I pointed out the immediate disappearance. Whether it's due to the fact that you acknowledged or it's due to some other fact makes no difference. That's a huge insight into vanishings. The default, meaning what you fall back on all other factors being equal is not to label. But just to be clear about the category with direct awareness, however, that is often very difficult. You'll find as soon as you try to track those things without at least mental labels. You just in Lala land in that case. Got a label. But the ideal is to be able to track with clarity and no mental not even a mental label. So that's sort of the default that you can gradually work towards with time, but don't fault yourself if you find that you have to use labeling most of the time I mean, sometimes I'll go for the no labels. But even for me. It's hard work is you know it's easier to do it with the labels of some sort. You can to a certain extent control. The concentration sensory clarity and equanimity that you have at a given time. You don't have a huge amount of control over it because those are the skills were trying to build if we have a lot of concentration clarity and equanimity to begin with, we wouldn't be doing these exercises. You don't lift weights. If you're already strong so we don't expect that you'll have much concentration clarity or equanimity. But there are things that you can do with the options in the noting apparatus that can. Help in those directions and the options come under 3 broad categories options, with regards to labeling. Options with regards to how you spatially direct your attention during the focus on phase. And options with regards to the pacing of the labeling if you come to me and report difficulty with practice the first thing I'll ask you is what techniques are using second thing I ask you is which options have you used to deal with the challenge. It's perfectly OK if you say, I tried them all and none of them helped. Then we'll go creative and I'll give you special exercises and so forth, but you should have at least tried them and see well could any of them help with the challenge. OK, with regards to. A clear acknowledge phase you have the following options. You can speak a label out loud, you can think a label Mentale you could not label at all, and some People finger label. We won't go into that, if you're ever interested. Maybe we'll talk about it someday, but that has been something that People. Some People have found useful it basically you just assign categories to fingers. In any way you want. If you would like to speak the labels out loud, you have sort of 3 levels. Strong medium and weak. The weak level is you whisper them so another can't hear you subvocalize that would be for a group meditation situation. The medium level is an ordinary voice. The strong is that you're forcing yourself to make the label you probably have resistance to doing it, making it loud and clear and crisp and you're really listening to make sure that that. Label stream does not stop and that's when you're really going up a Hill. Intentionally. Create a kind of gentle matter effect almost impersonal quality to the mental or spoken labels and that may seem artificial, but that will tend to induce equanimity. And it's a sort of like the tail can wag the dog kind of situation because you wouldn't think that artificially forming any quantumness voice would authentically induce equanimity into consciousness, but typically it does sometimes it might take. As long as a half an hour. Sometimes I work with People going through major physical and or emotional freakouts and I have one of the main tasks is to sort of get them to the point that they're willing. Perhaps in between sobbing and even screaming in pain. They're willing to have that equanimous voice to the labels. They don't have to be quantumness with regards to expression. They can flail they could scream they can cry, but they keep the labeling voice all be, it artificially with that, gentle matter-of-fact. NIS usually within 1/2 an hour consciousness itself has dropped into equanimity and my phrase for that is use the voice use the voice 2. Meaning the tone of voice, including the mental voice of your labeling to induce equanimity. In general, you do it not too fast, not too slow but everybody finds what's good for them. It's too fast, it's making you phonetic if it's too slow. You might be spacing out you find the rhythm that works for you? Sometimes the phenomenon that you're noting. Happens very, very rapidly. There's like a rapid fire stream like a machine gun shooting OK. It's like like really quick like talk dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot OK. It's like they've been my bank or sensations are by their very, very rapid. You just average OK. So every few seconds you just say touch and that's an abbreviation for. I just had a dozen. Lightning fast touch events, but you just go touch and you understand that OK. That's averaging what I experienced over the last few seconds. Some People find that the rhythm of the noting tends to entrain with the natural rhythm of their breathing that's fine. If that happens, let it happen do you should you try to make that happen certainly not but you don't have to prevent that from happening so that's the sort of pacing peace with regards to the rhythm of the breath of the rhythm of the noting relates to the rhythm of the breath if it entrains naturally and that really works for you, great but you don't have to fight with that happening and you certainly don't have to try to make that happen. The option to repeat. The same note more than once it can. Sort of slow down your internal Clock. An make it a little easier to. Detect things and so forth it's more likely that you will start to notice vanishings. If you constrain yourself to go back to the same thing for more than just a few seconds. If you say OK for a period of time? I'm going to do it that way. A further option is repeat until gone. OK, these are options, so you're going to go touch touch OK. And you're just gonna. Lock on to that touch. And keep noting touch touch until there's a vanishing. Until some part of it. Abruptly subsides. Then you're not God. And maybe if it doesn't disappear. Then you could move on to something else or whatever, so you can repeat until gone. Until there's some indication of abrupt subsidence is an option. An depending on what's happening and how things are presenting themselves that might be something that you would decide to do so. I know this is a lot of information, but actually. Most of you have heard this before many times, but I wanted you to get the whole picture of sort of the apparatus of noting with all the bells and whistles, so you realize how really powerful. It is if you internalize all of these variations. You should be able to deal with the bulk of challenges that would come up.","title":"Noting, 1 of 2 Parts"},{"location":"expandcontract/noting-part-2-of-2-zooming/","text":"With regards to the control of the spatial direction during the focus on phase, assuming that the thing doesn't vanish. Immediately that means it's extended in time. And. It is also extended in space. Easiest to understand his body sensation. You note feel. So that was the cleric knowledge, ING you use the word field 2. Indicate that you're having an emotional sensation in the body. So. It has a spatial extent may not be well defined. Typically, there will be places within a sensation that are intense and other places that are less intense. Typically, the less intense is around the border the more intense is at the center, but it doesn't necessarily have that kind of spatial configuration off and you will be able to detect that In addition to the local obvious sensation. There are subtle influences that spread from that, so it could be that you get spread that is continuous from the primary. But more frequently. You get sort of like a little pimping here a little ping there a little ping there. Or you may not be aware of any spread at all, so there is a spatial configuration once again. I emphasize it may not be well defined for you. That's OK, but there is an extent in space. Of that sensory event easiest to. Conceptualize with touch and feel but actually all the sensory categories that were sung about in that song can have a spatial extent to them in time for several seconds. You're going to be intently focusing on that category of acknowledged default means what you fall back on all other factors being equal right default with regards to how you control attention within the spatial scope of the thing you've acknowledged. Is not to control the attention however you do have the option if it seems appropriate useful too. In fact control your attention for those few seconds with regards to direction and spatial extent. If you Focus intentionally on a small part of the phenomenon will say that you're zooming zooming in just to have a word for that. Often, you want your be zooming in on small weak parts of body sensations to deal with intensities like pain or intense emotions. So it's got a local intensity here. Uh but it's around the perimeter, it's a little less intense. You zoom into a little piece of the perimeter ansi for these few seconds that I'm intently focusing is just that one little volume for just these few seconds. Maybe it will be easier to completely open up to that, than to deal with the whole phenomenon, so that's zooming in. Zooming out means that you spread your attention broadly at some extent. Of maybe over the whole sensation or as widely as you can detect the sensation so you're trying to sort of encompass the whole thing and. That also can sometimes dissipate intensity because it's sort of like the laws of in physical chemistry pressure is inversely proportional to volume so if you sort of give it volume. You can that make you may find that helpful so that's zooming out zooming in. The name is too. Zoom in and out at the same time. So what does that mean you would typically do that with something that is intense typically a body sensation the zoom in in this case means you intentionally go to the most intense part you can find. And the zoom out in this case means you simultaneously spread your awareness as broadly as you can through the body. I could explain why you might want to do it, however, that's not the same as just say that you should ever do this ever in your practice remember the default is not to control. This is true for all sensory phenomena, but particularly true for body sensation. Sensory phenomena tend to have a local impact that a global spread. Let's assume that there is spread. We won't be concerned with whether it's detectable or not will just assume that it's spreading. Perhaps below the threshold of awareness. If you Go local and at the same time spread your attention over the whole body. That tends to grease the rails for the spread to occur without resistance. Most of the suffering is not in local intensities. Most of the suffering is in the resistance to the subtle spread. Particularly the resistance to the spread that is below the threshold of awareness. And its resistance to very, very, very tiny sensations, so tiny that the surface consciousness is not aware of them. The resistance to the subtle spread to the body. Until it's been trained away is huge and those tiny little sensations catch. In the sort of the Gears of the nervous system. And that's why people's body shake and and so forth and that's actually where most of the suffering is so zooming in and out at the same. Time will tend to facilitate the spread, even if you're not in any way conscious of the spread. So that can help zooming in and out at the same time means that if it's done with regards to the body which typically is where it is done, although it works with image and talk believe it or not also but that's much sutler. Zooming in and out at the same time. With time will lead to a kind of experience of splash ripple through the body radiate beyond the body into the Infinity of space and dissipate. That tend to get that rhythm OK splash ripple filling the body radiation out. And release. Very much like the physics of raindrop falling into a pot. Is a certain amount of potential energy? That potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. As the raindrop falls. Hits the pond. What that energee going that potential energy it's now going into? A plop. A ripple OK but then. Ripples die away what happened to the Energi that was in the ripples well. It's partially sound, but then, when the sound OK. Sound is just the air rippling you got the water rippling, but what happens to the sound and the ripples in the water. There's no loss of energy conservation of energy basic principle of physics. Where did that enerji go it's in electromagnetic radiation in the infrared? Which means in heat? And that travels at the speed of light. And fills the entire universe and. In a tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny way warms, the farthest galaxies. And could never be retrieved. Basic enter principles of entropy. That potential energy that was in that raindrop is gone gone gone. It's gone OK, you have to go again against the gradient of entropy, which universe doesn't work. That way in order to recreate that potential energies. So what that means is that? Each thing that arises within us. Is if we experience it something along the lines that I'm describing? Takes on the taste of purification, which is the taste that that quantum of potential for suffering has been released within us forever. The zoom in zoom out tends to facilitate at the same time tends to facilitate that process. That's the good news, however, until that taste of purification comes on. Because you're not in any way fighting. You're giving your whole body. Consciously, or unconsciously you're giving your whole body. To the sensation. That means there's only so much real estate in consciousness, there may not be much room for the mind. And that leads because we use the mind as the ordinary ordering principle. You might have the impression that you're losing control. But you're not. Here in ordering principle that so primordial it could never be disordered. But it might take you a little while to realize that so the zoom in zoom out may may initially give you a sense of overwhelming loss of control. But if you could just hang with that that other flavor. Will come on? And so that's that option OK, so I warned you subtlety and complexity ahead, so that was a subtlety and complexity, if you never use. This this that's fine.","title":"Noting, Part 2 of 2, Zooming"},{"location":"expandcontract/om-mani-padme-hum-mindful-strategies-when-chanting/","text":"We're going to chant.

Focusing on just the sound and just the physical impact of the chant we would say that you're having a you sort of losing yourself in the chant. Other possibilities are to work with restful states. The chat tends to quiet internal talks so you can listen to the quieting effect tends to relax the body. So you can focus on restful experiences relaxation if you know how to work with these if you don't now you will by the end of the retreat physical relaxation, emotional piece in the body blank. Blank screen quiet head deep focus your eyes. Some People even focus on silence while they're chatting is sound is dominant? How is that possible? Well, some People know how to listen through or around sound to a background silence so some People like to explore the restful impact of the chat or you can say Explorer in ordinary experience. It hits about the sound you've got the. Physical touch of the chatting lots of times People will get enerji flows associated with the chanting process. So you get like Vibra. Tori Enerji in your body that can start to pervade all parts of your experience user to hear it in your talk space. See it in your image space. And so forth so some People like to explore the focusing on flow enerji and so forth. That the champ Induces That's another possibility. Traditionally, when People did chanting actually visualized in this case. They visualize the deity associated with the monitor in this case, it's of a local taste far so they actually did a sort of focus on positive they would visualize the deity listen to the externally but also internally as a mantra and access. Emotions of Joy Compassion and so forth so to use it. That way so you might want to work with one or a combination of those lots of possibilities. You can choose whatever appeals to you, but do have a clear idea and explore that now when we do the mindfulness practice. We do, noting which involves. Often mental labeling as an option usually People find it unproductive to attempt to label things while they're chatting. It sort of takes you away from that full involvement with the activity of chanting. But if you get really, really spaced out, then you can implement a mental labeling process so that's sort of a few. Basic guidelines for how to make the chant a meditative process for you. Oh. Well. Ha ha ha. Yeah.","title":"Om Mani Padme Hum - Mindful Strategies When Chanting"},{"location":"expandcontract/on-rites-rituals-and-ceremonies/","text":"People sometimes ask. If they come to one of my retreats. Will they have to participate in any kind of ceremonies or rituals. I've even had People ask if I come to one of your retreats while I have to bow to you. Well, I can tell you emphatically that you will not have to bow to me. Unless you want to make me feel uncomfortable, but I can deal with that. That's just a rising of self preferential fit so if you want to test my practice and see how I can deal with being made to feel uncomfortable. And, yes, you can bow to me, but otherwise that would definitely not be a feature of my retreats. In fact, most happy if People look upon me as just. I don't like anybody else, you like somebody you could challenge or say you know use screwed up or I disagree with you or? And so forth. So now you're not going to have to bow and that could have to do any kind of rights or rituals or ceremonies. Rites rituals ceremonies, we find them everywhere we find them in. Our early beginnings the tribal world. We find them in. Christianity. Particularly in the Catholic form or forms of Christianity. We find them everywhere. Historically, the boot da who lived approximately 2500 years ago. Seem to be pretty down on rights and rituals in the sense that he clearly stated that rights and rituals in and of themselves. Don't have any effect on the external world and actually don't have any effect on our internal spiritual progress. The rights and rituals in and of themselves. And since in his culture rights and rituals in and of themselves. Were considered to have a lot of effect and to be important? Peoples. Religious life spiritual life. Often centered around these rituals. To deny the efficacy of Rights and rituals. Was pretty? Damn revolutionary an actually got a lot of pushback. So when we look historically at Buddhism. There would seem to be a negation up. Rites rituals ceremonies and so forth. One of the things that the book that taught. Was to pay careful attention? To your experience. And he said that if you pay, careful attention to your experience you will see that. The nature of your experiences a Nietzsche impermanent. And. You will also realize that that's the nature of everything. Things change. One of the things that. Changes is Buddhism. It's a condition phenomenon all conditioned phenomenon phenomenon change. That was the last words of the Nietzsche Butter. Some Carl all conditioned things change. Buddhism as a cultural historical phenomenon is most assuredly a condition thing it may point. The path to something beyond conditions, but it itself is conditioned. And therefore. True to the foot does on teaching. Who doesn't changed some People held to earlier forms of practice something People we've evolved new forms of practice some People help to earlier terminology and conceptual frameworks. Other People develop new terminology new conceptual framework. Buddhism disappears from its native soil of India. Around the year 1200 AD. We get there's a long process, but if you want a sort of OK to think in easy round numbers. You can think of Buddhist history as spanning. On Indian soil approximately. 1700 years, there's the 500 years of the BC and then there's about 1200 years of the Eiti. Fortunately, Buddhism by the time it was wiped out in India. Have been. Propagated throughout the rest of Asia preserved and now in fact, has been reintroduced into Hindi up during that 1700 years. Changes took place. About 500 years after the printers depth very, very roughly speaking once again just to give you some simple home after benchmarks. Reaction to early Buddhism arose. That said. It's not enough just to be liberated for your own liberation. It's equally important to contribute to the liberation and broadly. The welfare of other People, those 2 are on the same footing. So that's called Mahayana Buddhist. The Buddha's life exemplified that he served but his teachings tended to. Tell People you need to set up get yourself Liberal. About 700 years after the Mahayana Revolution started the Vad Rihanna Revolution started so from say 780 to 12180. Other developed something called venture out of my life. What version is known by a lot of different names but we'll just use that one for now. What's interesting about but Rihanna is relative to rights and rituals is at the other end of the spectrum? It's all about rights in rituals. So does this mean that God Rihanna is the ultimate degradation of the original teachings of the good die. Not at all. The Buddha said rights and rituals. All in and of themselves are not efficacious. But rights and rituals. If you wish. Can create? An ideal situation to develop concentration sensory clarity and equanimity they can be vehicles. For a meditative practice. So if you make it a vehicle for meditative practice, you use the simplified situation the repetitiveness the symbolism and so forth? Then you write and ritual can be a legitimate practice. There was a famous Kabbalistic Master in Judaism, who said. Judaism without cough ona is Idolatry Covenant is the Hebrew word for high concentration. Implying that if you just superficially do the Jewish liturgy. You might as well be worshipping idols on the other hand, if you intentionally focus and use that environment to cultivate a certain state of consciousness. Then. Yeah, so it's a powerful practice. We don't use rights and rituals at my retreats, but We often will do a sweat. Lodge afterwards for those who wish to to go back to a very ancient form of writing ritual one that most assuredly developed deep concentration clarity and equanimity.","title":"On Rites, Rituals, and Ceremonies"},{"location":"expandcontract/open-up-and-turn-towards/","text":"Letting go if we use that term as an equivalent for equanimity will certainly on the average eventually cause us to feel better and better and better, however, for short periods of time, particularly in the early years of once practice. One can go through periods where the deeper one goes the more uncomfortable one becomes or one of the classic manifestations. Of that is the more we relax the more icky sticky yucky kinds of antsy unbearable sensations. Arise within us. I have a whole article about that. I call it the Icky Sticky Creepy Crawly doesn't really hurt, but I can't stand it. Flavor of sensation that has a very peculiar characteristic that the deeper you drop into somebody and the more you relax the. Yucky or it gets at least for a while, creating a negative feedback loop, causing a person to be disinclined to drop into the deeper states. In fact, I once heard a senior Burmese teacher who had studied with Lucille Ananda referred to it as somebody pain in English. I'd never heard that phrase. Maybe he made it up, but clearly he was familiar with the phenomenon. So that's one of the forms that going deeper makes things yucky or there are other. Manifestations of that disorientation for example, you go deep and sort of get disoriented or you see more vulnerable, etc, etc. I can only say that these are temporary phenomena. They're not characteristic of the big picture, the long-term practice. Essentia Lee, we can say that the spiritual path is a path. Of shedding. Gradually, one coping mechanism and acquiring another coping mechanism for life, the coping mechanism. That's being shed could be succinctly characterized as. Deal with what comes from the outside and comes from the inside by tighten up and turn away. That sort of works it armors. It's basically an armoring and denying strategy which can sort of blunt. Things but in the end doesn't really work very well so hopefully a person will eventually mature to the point where they realize Oh. There's a better way of going about dealing with the impact of the intensity of the outside and stored poison and paying on the inside and they cultivate that better way, the tricky thing is that that better way. Is ultimately a better way? However, it is the diametric opposite of the former way it could be specifically characterized as open up and turn torts. The open up is the equanimity piece that turned towards is the sensory clarity peace. So because it's the exact opposite of the previous strategy. It's difficult to avoid what I call awkward intermediate states where the old strategy is being shed. So it can't quite shield, you anymore In other words, the mesh of your being is somewhat opening. Uh. But it makes you vulnerable because it's not so open that the slings, and arrows will pass through without catching but you're not you don't have the tight mesh that sort of Shields, you so that creates this awkward intermediate stage and there's no way around, it because. That's the price of going from one coping mechanism to another if we think of enlightenment as the most stable state, the ground state. Of our being then there. Our other states set. Would not be as deep is that OK so let's say that we're in a relatively grounded state here. But we would like to go to the global optimal the most grounded state possible for the system, which might be called our source. Well, it will often. Happen that in a thermodynamic system in order to make the transition from a relative ground state to an absolute ground state. One has to go over this metastable ungrounded situation. And so when I actually passes through a lot of those things, but there will be a tendency to drop eventually. To the deepest ground state so that's sort of the price. One pays may have to pay for moving on to the next level of well being.","title":"Open Up and Turn Towards"},{"location":"expandcontract/ordinary-consciousness-is-the-way-part-1/","text":"I. Decided along time ago that I would talk about all the kinds of experiences that may happen to People. Even though there's a certain danger in that because it sets up expectations. Cravings aversions comparison mind. Desires and so forth so I just give you the little heads up nothing that I'm going to describe tonight in terms of sensory experiences are required for the classical path to enlightenment. You may have experiences like what I'm going to describe you may not there's lots of different arcs that People go through in Traverse Ng. The territory between surface and source. So one of the themes that can come up for a person is the theme of impermanence and each other in the Pali language, Anita in Sanskrit. Have a Set of techniques for working with this theme. I call it focus on change. There's nothing Mystical SH. Mystical or special about the fact that sensory experience changes, if you've ever noticed a sensation get stronger. Or get weaker. Anybody ever notice that OK, then you've noticed impermanence, it changed intensity levels vary. An you may think that. My backs been taking you know in an unvarying way all afternoon. You know you know, my back hurt all afternoon so the backs been hurting all afternoon. Sort of sounds like that right the afternoon started. Afternoon is over. Sounds like it's a constant function. But if you pay close attention. Uh it's not exactly a straight line. It's sort of like well. It was a little more than a little less than a little more than a little less is you know, maybe a little bit of ripple on that, if we speak more accurately. As we begin to look a little bit more accurately still. Is changing this may become more evident a sense of rising passing? Begins to appear we will remember last night, I said that. That. The more you focus on the impermanence the more sensitive you become to it. Uh that's sort of like the clarity in the concentration peace, but the more equanimity you have with things. Since equanimity is sort of makes you more flexible and I would compare concentration to muscle strength and maybe clarity is like definition in training and then so equanimity would be analogous to flexibility. So as you become more flexible. Of course, you can reflect the flow of impermanence spirit. If you wish so at some point you may actually get a sense that. What was just the hint of a ripple or became peaks and valleys that actually there's rising passing? Rising passing rising passing rising passing like that. I sometimes like to ask A. A rhetorical question. Do mountains dance and I would suggest to you, that there's 3 possible answers. Yes. No and it depends and I would say it depends it depends on how patiently. And how carefully you look at a mountain. If you look with the patients of centuries In other words, great equanimity. Timeless equanimity is a kind of timeless world. Some of you have gone into this you may have had an experience either under conditions of great ease or under conditions of great parallel parallel. Time sort of slows down OK and there's like this. This is an altered sense well when you drop into equanimity deeper levels of equanimity that you have the patience of centuries. And viewed with the patients of centuries In other words, in time lapse photography. What is the surface of the earth look like? Roiling streaming protoplasm. Really alive with flux. So it depends on how patiently you look In other words, how much equanimity. There is it's also help carefully you look if you look at anything beyond the level of the Atom nor the molecule for that matter is just to dance of Energi. Amounted but if you don't look really finally or you don't look so there's not the clarity peace. If you don't look patiently. There's not the equanimity piece in the mountains seems solid as a rock as the expression goes. So unsubtle is significant underneath that hint of ripple. Are in an entire world rising passing rising passing rising passing? There are. Different. Flavors of Impermanence. Or change one is changing intensity. I just sort of graph that. Another very significant way that sensory experiences changes. They sort of shift in shape. Remember we've made a big thing about this spatial nature of experience that you can localize, perhaps not with great precision. But you can sort of get a general sense of size shape and position of body sensations and indeed even. Auditory thoughts have a sort of size shape and position in your head visual thoughts up in front in image space and so forth so if you. So to zoom out and cover the whole area of, say a sensation. You may notice that it shifts a little bit here shifts a little bit that subtle a significant may not be all that dramatic, but like a millimeter here. You know it's sort of like moves over here moves over there and as you're watching that little way. Venus and whatever and you're infusing it with equanimity and time is passing those shifting shapes. Can become much more significant an fascinating you can get so fascinated with how it moves that you become less concerned with whether it's pleasure or pain, it all starts to feel good even uncomfortable sensations feel good because of the way they move. There's like a fascination with it. Almost a massage too. It Marshall Mcluhan said medium is the message right. But I would take it one step back. The Nature's deepest message is is not the medium. It's the movement of the medium. That's a primordial message that flows through all of nature and since our sensory systems are part of nature flows through US.","title":"Ordinary Consciousness is the Way - Part 1"},{"location":"expandcontract/ordinary-consciousness-is-the-way-part-2/","text":"One of the sensory experiences that you focus on is a restful state, which is the darkness brightness in front of or behind your clothes eyes. I call that I say that represents a blank mental screen. Now, although that that darkness brightness could be stable in which case actually that can be good. That becomes what's called a Casina and that can stabilize consciousness and become a basis for absorption states on the other hand, very often that darkness brightness is sort of swirling vibrating or whatever. That's impermanence that's flow. And most People at least occasionally get that sense of flow in the blank on their mental screen. And if you focus on it. The more you focus on it. The more fluid. It becomes it becomes sort of massages. You it comforts you and so forth so. My generic term for continuous type changes is flow and then if something disappears. That's gone banishing so in the restful aspect of image space, then maybe flow images come they? Typically they disappear, so that's a vanishing even when they're rising. They may fade in fade out melt morph so there's usually some even if there's image activity. There's some sense of change what can be really interesting. This doesn't happen to a lot of People but sometimes you can have mental images that they're like they're real. They're like alive. There animated from inside just like living things, the 3D. And they just move as though God's hand inside a puppet making this thing animated. Sometimes People get freaked out when that happens, but if you. Just get fascinated with the flow of expansion and contraction in those realistic images. Then you're going to go to the source. That's going to take you to the formless doing that molds, not only those those images, but the visual so-called material world everything. In other words, If you ever have not that this happens very often, but sometimes People quote see spirits and whatever there's two ways that you can relate to that. One is well it's sort of a message and you can honor its content. But that's the world of powers and that has its place. But what we would prefer is that you be not be so interested in that message, but be interested in the movement of the medium. Because when you're seeing spirits you're very close to seeing the great spirit. But you have to let go of your preoccupation with spirits and just see the underlying. Pure flow of formless enerji that is what is behind making them seem so real? I know half the People hearing this are. I'll never experience that I never experienced that OK and the other half is I hope I don't experience that well. Some People experiences and if you do you'll know how to make use of it as a liberation path as opposed to either something that wigs you out or something that shuts you off into. A lesser God, let's put it that way. So, in your visual thinking, either the acted the restful aspect of the blank or the active aspect of image activity. There could be flow. Things could vanish things could change and move in Melton morph and you could decide to focus on that and a sort of ride on that get fascinated with it. The more you focus the more pronounced. It gets that's the theme of flow and go in visual thinking about auditory thinking well. Sometimes it is not too much happening there. There's a kind of quiet but then there's an underlying current a kind of buzz. That's a kind of Vibra. Tori flow in the subtle auditory processing. In Tibetan that's called numbed oke oke. Jane they actually have a term for that. A technical term numb dope means thinking and Oak means underneath or beneath and G means us stream. So I took great pleasure in finding out that this thing that I had always called subtle processing and made part and parcel as you know of the techniques. Sure enough into bed. It was known and they have a technical term for it and somebody told me that Tibetan scholar, a couple of months ago anyway. So you can have that subtle sort of Vibra. Tori flow and talk space and even when you have explicit words in talk space. They may boom in talk space that's expanding. That's expensive flow. They made grip and hold you. That's contracted flow so in your auditory thoughts. You could have flowing experiences and what's interesting about what I call talk or auditory thinking has some sort of interesting characteristics. One is for most People, the hardest to stop and not that I'm advocating you stop it. But if you try to stop it. It's hard to stop it. But it's very easy to initiate you can think about anything you wanted talk space. You can repeat a mantra or some litany and there's a lot of control and initiating talk. It's really hard to stop doing it once it gets going the other interesting thing is. That. Talk is probably the easiest sensory phenomenon within which to notice abrupt vanishings. People will often report this to me as though it were a problem. It's like as soon as I notice. My internal talk. It disappears what am I doing wrong. It's not a problem. That's an insight insight into impermanence. So you can note the Vanishings. The Ganz so as you can see the mind is mental experience visual thinking an auditory thinking. Has a lot of potential for impermanence for focusing on the theme of change about the body? Well, if you sort of zoom out and cover your whole body. It's pretty hard to keep the whole thing in awareness an perfectly stable. It tends to puff out a little here pull in a little bit there. That's flow. There is sometimes People get tingling vibration undulation that's flow a problem that People report in the body is. There's pressure and People usually blame themselves for it's like well, something is trying to expand but I'm resisting it kind of thing they make themselves responsible if you have pressure. You can ask yourself is it inward outward or bidirectional and instead of making it a problem. Just lookup on it as force flow. Pressure is actually momentum flux, so you can look up on that as a kind of flow. Einstein did so, instead of making pressures something I'm resisting or I'm fighting or I'm whatever it's just there's an outward force so that's an expansion whether there's even if there's no volume metric change. It is an expensive flavor of flow in that forces. Blowing out pressure force inward and just yield to it, it might make it worse for a little while, but then at some point. You get a sense it. Yes, that's not a problem that's part of the flow of nature, too.","title":"Ordinary Consciousness is the Way - Part 2"},{"location":"expandcontract/ordinary-consciousness-is-the-way-part-3-of-3/","text":"id: ordinary-consciousness-is-the-way-part-3-of-3 title: Ordinary Consciousness is the Way - Part 3 of 3 hide_title: false sidebar_label: Ordinary Consciousness is the Way - Part 3 of 3 Reviewed and edited 3/10/2020 There was a Zen Master. So... maybe you know who this was, I can't remember the origin of the expression: \"\u5e73\u5e38\u5fc3\u662f\u9053\" Well, you might know \"\u9053 (dao)\", the cosmic way. \u662f(shi) means \"is\". \u5fc3 (shin) you might know, it means mind or consciousness or heart. \"The ordinary consciousness is the way.\" The cosmic way. Well, what's the ordinary consciousness? The ordinary consciousness is scattered in all directions and obsessing on one thing... then scattered in all directions and obsessing on one thing... then scattered in all directions. Or maybe scattered and obsessing at the same time, same instant. Is that the cosmic way? Absolutely. That scattering...that's just nature expanding. That's expansive flow. That thing that you call fixation that you make a problem; that's just nature contracting, contractive flow. If you look at it that way you don't have a problem. It's just space dancing. So, in the mind, in the body. Both in pleasant guises and unpleasant guises. And if it presents itself saliently, you might want to make it a theme in your practice. In fact, it could present itself so intensely that you sort-of have no choice but to make it a theme in your practice because there's hardly anything else that you can detect. That's in the most extreme cases, an experience that's technically called \"bhanga\". You can look it up on the Internet. B-H-A-N-G-A. When the flow and the vanishing become so intense that they just dominate your experience. Once again, plenty of people have become enlightened without ever having that experience. Just something to know that can happen. How about external experience? How about sounds? Well, do they sort of vibrate? Do they sort of \"boom\", OK? Is it easy to detect the vanishing of certain kinds of sounds? You can listen if you choose the right kind of music with well-defined phrase structures. You can listen to the \"Gones\". To the unborn absolute silence whence the music comes and whether it returns moment by moment. Just by choosing the right kind of music to do a music meditation with. As well-defined phrase structures. \"Da-da-da-da-da-da-da... Gone! Da-da-da... Gone!.... da-da-da... Gone! Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da... Gone.\" You can hear those endings very clearly defined. So, sounds space could be an exploration of impermanence. Sight is much more tricky to work with. But if you defocus your eyes, things get sort of swirly, OK, and then you might say: \"Well that's just an illusion.\" But then you're using that to develop a kind of equanimity with sight and then when you start looking in the ordinary way there's still sort-of more fluid, OK. One of the payoffs that come from late-night sitting and all-night sitting (We'll have another yaza late-night sit on Thursday, is that correct? Is that right? So you'll have an opportunity about 3:00 in the morning.) Your eyes will start to swim, OK, and so will the external world. And that can be an interesting venue to penetrate the something-ness of the so-called material world in front of you in sight-space. So although it's a bit more challenging, we can have the experiences of impermanence flow and vanish in sight-space. In fact, if you look carefully, each time your eyes shift, when it goes from one side to another, the world that was, just falls away. It's a little tricky you have to sort of look out of the corner of your eye as you shift, but it definitely goes \"ka-chunk\". That's vanishing in sight-space. All of our senses have a both in their ordinary active guise of touch-sight-sound-feel-image-talk or in the special tranquil-restful-sort-of-a-meditative-experiences-of relaxation-light-silence-peace-blank-quiet. In all of these experiences, there is the possibility for some hint of either flowing kind of change or abrupt vanishing. And if one wanted to pursue this as a theme, one could. Why would one perhaps want to do that? Well... it can be very... although sometimes it can be harsh...sometimes, often, and in the end, it is very soothing. And you get the sense that the substance of your being is being worked on. \"Energia\". A \"working\" within that is working out the poison and pain. It's kind of a purifying experience. It's also a unifying experience because flow tends to flow. And it cuts across the distinctions. In this path, there's a place for making empowering distinctions. Distinguishing touch-sight-sound-feel-image-talk, these different dimensions of sensory experience. There's also a place for those distinctions disappearing. And one of the ways that those distinctions disappear in empowering way is that the flow and vanishing unify them. And larger and larger pieces of sensory experience turn into a flow field. And when external site an internal image external sound an internal talk flow together, then the boundary between inside and outside disappears. And that's a very natural way to come to an integration.. a unification. And since the fundamental separation of inside and outside is more or less synonymous with fear, clearly, you understand why I choose the word empowering in speaking about the theme of impermanence.","title":"Ordinary consciousness is the way part 3 of 3"},{"location":"expandcontract/paradigms-of-change/","text":"Focus on change. Comes from originally from the early Buddhist perception of a Nietzsche or impermanence. But if you look through Buddhist history. You'll see that over the ages the notion of impermanence has been has itself been impermanent. I'm not surprised. It's changed overtime in some lineages for example. If you Work within the loop akin windage. Rich involves the technique of body sweeping where you systematically move the awareness up and down through the body and. Eventually, in other patterns also so making these sort of reciprocal's scans of somatic awareness. This tends to. Create. Unawareness of a subtle Vibra Tori, bubbly flavor of flow. That People find very pleasant. They're very carefully instructed not to form an attachment to that, but simply observe what is? And then sometimes the opposite of that happens everything. It's very solid and intense and horrific and OK don't form an aversion to that just keep sweeping through a brilliant innovation. Because it gets you down to a very fine scale of somatic resolution and at that scale vibra. Tori nature of the nervous system, the Vibra Tori nature of nature. Will present itself to you and who bakin? Talked about that as impermanence that's a Nietzsche. But where is the book that talked about it always linked impermanence to duca? Right things pass and we hold on to them and then we set ourselves up for suffering kidding. Our happiness on things that aren't going to last. Here we get. In the Uber Ken Linneage, a positive take on impermanence. It's a kind of Purifying Enerji that gets activated within you and starts to work on, you, which sort of links it to notions of. The Holy Spirit working on you energia. Long long before that was ever used in Physics in its present meaning. It was used by Christian monks and nuns to describe the energy. Yeah, that working end with the energy of the working end within one of the Holy Spirit. That sort of dissolves the something nacin. The impurities within you well but can calls that activating impermanent said he puts a positive spin. On impermanence and while at the same time of course, acknowledging the original Buddhist notion of impermanence as. A possible source of suffering like a good scientist. Built on the work of the printer. Are you a he or whoever? His teachers were that came up with this notion? My own teacher, Joshu Sasaki Rashi. Has vastly? Innovated with regards to the notion of change for impermanence. He likes to describe it in terms of expansion and contraction. To say that when you look carefully you see that all the different flavors of flow that can occur Vibra Tori, Angela Tori. Even inward outward pressures and so forth. These can all be interpreted. In terms of two fundamental flow patterns. 1. Expansion the other contraction you're going to have a sensation that's a solid as a rock. But if you look if you analyze the pressure you can usually find there's an outward pressure in an inward pressure. Oh yeah, there banging together and clashing and producing a horrific pain, but the fact is if you let the part that wants to press in press in and the part that wants to push up with Charlotte. You let that happen, it gets worse. They interdigitate. And yes, indeed is just expansion and contraction empty space. So you can take solid experiences and work with them and he gives this gigantic list of synonyms for expansion and contraction. Expansion or call it life would call it affirmation you can call it. Future you can call it outside, and then contraction could call it death. You can call it negation. You could call it pass. You can call it inside was that all these synonyms. Many of which don't seem to have anything in common? If you get attached to the words. But then if you listen deeply you'll see that there are pairs of binary contrasts that in some way or another involve the notion of affirmation versus negation. Or bigness versus smallness. In the path of purification decent embargo, which is sort of like the classic commentary on the Buddhist Canon used in much of SE Asia. There's a place where the author put icosa describes the stage in practice. Where you're observing the rising and passing of phenomena? And then you become aware that. And I was sooner does something arise, but it also passes. Would I up by a is the word that's used in Poly, who die? Is rising up.

Well, here's what happened. He was give me a guided OK. This part I. I know because I Journal this part, he was giving me a guided. And I was just telling him what I was experiencing. And he said. What did you say that's how I didn't come to and say coach I've got a really great idea? If he hadn't picked it up, I might even own. I said it. I mean that's that's the honest truth. I 'cause I thought that's what everybody saw but there is. What what did I say Oh I was just I was out loud? I said Oh I see well he was he was having to look at what we now call active active states right of image and talk or I've just thinking, we just. Just thinking, I mean, if you read a lot of the stuff. It's just thinking they don't talk about breaking it down the way he has right so I just I just basically he said.

Said picture picture and that's what I called I called a picture and. He said what you say, said picture when you see it's hard to believe with his mind that he had an experience that but? I suspect that he had experience it, but he's just goes so deep that he dismisses some of that. Surface surface stuff, I mean, I have no idea but for each of you, you likely know the first time you did. This you had a predominant way this would I think my students. There is a predominant. Imager talk that they come up with right and then once you introduce some give it a heads up. Then they'll say, Oh yeah. I am and now that you're doing, it, you know that every minute you're having 10 hits of image 10 hits of thought and also the rest states all at once right the more you start to really look at this stuff you see it's all over the place all the time right, I mean, it's just layered scaffold upon scaffolding. That's why it's it's it's just so fascinating to see the way he is. I mean, this divide and conquer piece. You know is this the other thing about these unique ways of just summarizing it. Yeah, we've we've come up with a lot of things I was, I was either blessed or cursed to have some of the early days of him kind of feeling his way. On some of these things you know, some of the sweat work. We did and that it just things just kind of evolved.

He literally has rounded this thing out to 99 + 9% of what it is, you know, I mean, just just really as I say in the acknowledgement of this book, Slash Manual that I've written. Just such a great acknowledgement that he is just relieving suffering on this planet with this stuff just in such incredible ways.

Sensations feeling image and talk so that's be fit and that's that's about 10 years ago. That's what we were. We were by sensations. Feeling image and talk and there's several of us oldies that still have not really bought into the idea of yeah, yeah. I know where to go with this because it's you know it's public and all that, but Hey, the big guys heard me tell him a dozen times and we have some very, very animated discussions over basically say you know, I think you're being dead right on this functions in I think you're absolutely right and separating kind of touch and feel and I'm sure that it's the field is maybe all in the body. I mean, so therefore, you can legitimately fit spaces body image. However, I think for the average person learning it. They relate to a body sensation like pain in my knee and they relate to pain in my heart different so that's why I continue to teach just be fit. So I just say this because stay open this and if he was. He would say the same thing? Don't just buy what I tell you like make it your own, he's always saying make it your own so some of this is just not chosen to kind of come on board with some of the current stuff, but for the most part.

But if you look at a rat brain. Flat. It's through the surface is smooth, so non convoluted brain type. I've called this in cephalic. So why is this related to anything? Well, the problem is the convolutions obscured the organization of the brain that's like especially in a human brain. So they have what they call it exploded brains that a computer could do where it makes it into a giant ball. So then it makes you see how it's really organized. It's more intuitive but you don't need that with a rat brain. It's already that way. And if you look at the mapping of the processing areas in a rats brain.

They would carry to keep you awake and also to sort of help you with physical discomforts, but mostly to scare you into alertness, they carry keisaku in the? Rinzai Zen tradition is called a kill soccer in the Soto Zen. It's the same. Chinese characters that mean wake up stick literally waking stick or wake up stick but also the same character. That means wake up. It also means startle actually. And I used to carry the K soccer and like black People and People used to carry the case. Octo and whacked me and when I came back to the United States. Initially moved into a Vietnamese style Buddhist temple in Los Angeles, the international Buddhist meditation center on New Hampshire. In Korea town still there and because I had been in Japan and had this N background ice initially sort of taught in the Zen Mode. So. I had a case soccer. And I used to use it. It retreats and this is way way way back in the 70s. Security was not that crazy fear that it is now at airports and so forth so I would actually carry the keisaku onto the plane. And sometimes they ask you know at the checkpoint sort of like what's that right and I said, well it's it's used for giving a Japanese massage, which is true? When it's done right, and I've had the privilege of having it done rights by Real Masters. I once got soccer. Dbi by Roshi Not Society, Russian, a different Roshi, who was also a Kendall Master. Imagine what it would be like to be a basketball being dribbled by Kareem Abdul-jabbar, OK. That's what my body felt like it was like he could dribble me at the end of the case soccer like pick me up and put me down. I mean, obviously physics laws don't allow for that. But it sort of seemed like that. Much power at the end of that thing and what it's done right, it hits on what I think is Gallbladder 21. Which is both a stimulating point? And mellowing out point at the same time, and boy that is what it does to you. It causes the shower of endorphins. It doesn't hurts a little bit, but it doesn't really like hurt the way you might think it hurts all your muscles, relax all the pain goes down right down to your toes if it's done right, and you are awake, you are definitely awake. So I used to carry it, you know at IBM's at the international Buddhist meditation center and but what I noticed is that? As I began to move more into the Vipasana Mode. I notice it first of all initially People are like really scared. Uh. And. Then they develop an addiction to it, and what else they could request it the way I was doing it. So it's like I'm I'm sort of fostering fear and then addiction here. Yes. And maybe you know it's like so I just sort of got out of the habit years years later. I discovered Sasaki Row Sheet and I translated for him for 5 years, but didn't really study with him, but then I guess you know the center of gravity just gradually had a strong enough influence that I just couldn't resist so I started to go to sessions at Mount Baldy. So it's like. By that time I meditated for quite awhile, so I first session at Mount Baldy and there, sitting and. They bring up the K soccer right. They walk in a? In a very menacing threatening way intentionally. With a kind of mincing pace that sort of like gives you the impression at any instant. They're going to turn their going to suddenly turn around and beat the living crap out of you. Now mind you. It feels good OK. And I've had it done to be in. I'd done it to People for years and years and years previously. So I'm sitting there. And. On site, the guys Sky starts to walk by you know. And this terror arises within me. Uh this primordial intense intense terror. Actually, I couldn't even control my body. I actually started to move so I got hit. Which felt good but? Yes. So you might think and then and that happened every time for the whole session, an for the next session, for the next session. It was like that's what the whole thing was about was like I'm like sweating bullets and * * bricks. Every time these guys are carrying the stick, which is frequently during the day. So now you might think. That self talk would be like. What is wrong with me? OK. That I'm having this. Huge overblown reaction. But that's not the self talk that arose not in the slightest. What arose was wisdom function? That understood what was happening. Why it was happening and what to do about it? So what was the difference. 115 years ago when I was in Japan. And they carry it with the same threatening you know whatever. And I didn't even notice it. I was so lost in my thoughts and you know in my memory plan of fantasy whatever. I I didn't even notice what was going. Years and years and years of meditation. Be careful what you ask for what you know how many People come to me and say, Oh, if only I could have a peaceful mind. Well, you can have a peaceful mind, but there's a price to pay for a peaceful mind. And what's left if the image and talk turns off what's left of you. What's left of you? Is a frightened little infants body is what's left of you? And so when Darth Vader. Is is coming out of the world of threatening archetypes? OK. That's Well, that's all that was there now could I have. Turn that all off. By rationalization easy just start thinking site, OK that's so and so and I've known him for years and he's a friend of mine and if he hits me it's going to feel good. I could rationalize away the fear but that's not the idea. The idea is disk hour down into the infantile animal levels of your being no matter how embarrassing that might be. No matter how inconvenient that might be. You don't rationalize it away, you train the body. At that primitive level and it doesn't. It's like OK that's what's happening and I know exactly what to do. And eventually reach the point where as soon as they started to carry the case Aqua. This. Wave of power fear would spread to me turn into flow caused me to merge with the person carrying the Keisaku and the entire room. And it was like. Just. Catharsis city. Just Bliss City. So you want 1:00 this well. One way to get it is work through separateness at the primitive level of the body.","title":"Primal Feel and the Zen Keisaku - 1 of 2"},{"location":"expandcontract/purification-and-fulfilment-four-formulas/","text":"James Clark Maxwell described the whole of electromagnetic theory in terms of for fundamental field equations. I somewhat jokingly also have a set of 4 equations that describe the issue of human happiness and human suffering in terms of the body start the first with the first one here suffering equals discomfort multiplied by resistance. So what I mean by discomfort in this case is physical or emotional uncomfortable sensations. So one form of discomfort would be pain, but tiredness is a form of discomfort, too hot, to cold hunger things like that. Those are all forms of physical discomfort, then body sensations, such as those associated with anger fear sadness shame impatients those would be. Emotional uncomfortable flavors in the body, so physical or emotional uncomfortable flavors in the body. I called Generically referred to as discomfort. Resistance means and any interference with the natural flow of those sensations. That means any fighting with their arising or any holding on preventing them from passing in their natural pattern so any interference with the natural expansion and contraction of body sensation is resistance. So when you have physical or emotional. And or emotional discomfort in your body, the degree to which you fight with that by pushing and pulling is the resistance. Now we tend to think of resistance as a mental thing based on our attitudes well actually that's rather small part of the resistance. That's part of it, but most of the resistance is in the body circuits themselves at a very deep primordial level when the body begins to make a sensation it also. Will begin to interfere with its own product? Fortunately, through meditation practice, we can train the body out of the habit of resisting interfering with its own sensations. The intensity of the discomfort multiplied by the degree of interference with its natural flow. Measures the perceived suffering that you get from that. That's the first formula suffering equals discomfort multiplied by resistance now. This is a linear approximation of something that's probably a much more complex mathematical model. But this will give sort of rough approximation of what goes on. There's both good news and bad news in this formula, the good news is that if you have a lot of intensity of discomfort. But you reduce the resistance to a small amount. Then you're perceived suffering will go down. Even if you have huge discomfort. In fact, the best news of all is it is theoretically possible with sufficient training or just buy. The evolution that comes through living to reduce resistance to 0 in which case even with huge discomforts. The perceived suffering would be 0 because no matter how large this is if this is zero. Anything multiplied by zero is 0, so that's the good news. What's the bad news in this formula, the bad news is that you can have very small discomforts physical or emotional? Uncomfortable sensations in the body that are wispy hardly even noticeable, perhaps could even be so mild that there below the threshold of awareness. But if their subject to huge subliminal resistance interference impedance you will have the impression of huge suffering. That's the bad news and a lot of the distortions that take place in human behavior are due to rather tiny emotional type sensations. Some of them below the threshold of awareness that are filling the body and subject to huge resistance, therefore cause a huge perception of suffering. And distort our behaviors in the object if world, so that's formula number one. The sort of flip side of that is purification equals discomfort multiplied by equanimity equanimity is the opposite of resistance equanimity could be said at least 2 a linear approximation to be the reciprocal of resistance so as the resistance goes down the equanimity goes up as equanimity goes up the discomfort. Turns into Not only a Freedom from suffering or a reduction of suffering, but a positive flavor of purification, which leads to fulfillment so it is actually possible to have a fulfilling empowering experience of physical and even emotional discomfort in the body. If you bring enough equanimity to it, you'll actually get a taste of purification, which turns into a kind of taste of fulfillment something meaningful and useful is happening to the depths of ones being because of how you're experiencing a physical pain or even an emotional discomfort in the moment with high equanimity so. Discomfort here. The opposite of discomfort pleasure. Frustration equals pleasure multiplied by resistance if you push and pull on the natural flow of pleasure resist its arising resist. It's passing, then it doesn't give you fulfillment. It gives you a sense of frustration. This is the Imelda Marcos phenomenon? How many shoes will fulfill you if you can't get fulfillment from one the answer is no amount will do it. Because you don't know how to turn pleasure into fulfillment. That's this last equation fulfillment equals pleasure multiplied by equanimity. The good news here is that with very small pleasures. Tiny little pleasures actually an enormous equanimity enormous noninterference you can derive enormous fulfillment so the bad news is this formula, which leads to Imelda Marcos people with huge pleasures in their life that can't get any satisfaction. Their frustrated that's because they don't know they have not trained their pleasure circuits out of the impedance so that's the bad news. The really good news here. Even with relatively small amounts of pleasure, physical or emotional a human being can derive enormous fulfillment. If they train their pleasure circuits into equanimity and that fulfillment actually brings the same flavor of purification that you get here. So you can purify consciousness in two ways by experiencing discomfort with equanimity. Or by experiencing pleasure with equanimity.","title":"Purification and Fulfilment - Four Formulas"},{"location":"expandcontract/reality-sensory-experience/","text":"I usually don't talk about reality. I prefer to talk about sensory experience. Sensory experience is something I have a lot of confidence. Uh with when I make statements about sensory experience. It's based on years and years of my own investigations working with my own sensory experience other People sensory experience. So. As I say have a lot of confidence in that I don't speak about the underlying reality. That's behind sensory experience or even if there is a reality behind sensory experience or? What is it People will often ask well you know what? Do we really see what do we really here? The reason I don't talk about it is that I don't have confidence that I have good answers about it. I have my own conjectures, but they're just that. When it comes to sensory experience, I know I can teach People things that are true deep useful and broad now in general things that are true deep useful and broad are considered good science, so I think I can give good science for sensory experience. In terms of what's behind sensory experience or what's really out there. I notice that very intelligent People. Seemed to be arguing about this. For a very, very long time. Intelligent People that have given a lot of thought and research, to the question of what is object if X Ternal Reality? That is to say scientists and philosophers. People who specialize in this field do not seem to be able to agree. And have not been able to agree for a very, very long time. That indicates to me that, although someday, the question probably will be answered in a satisfactory way for humanity. At this point in human history, it still contentious and conjectural and therefore not something that I as an amateur would want to make any statements about so I limit myself to what I know for sure. I know for sure that our sense of perceiving self arises through feel image talk reactions to touch sight sound. I know for sure that suffering equals paid multiplied by resistance, etc, etc. And for me these. Awareness is of sensory experience are enormously liberating I know for sure that when you bring enough concentration clarity and equanimity to any ordinary sensory experience that ordinary sensory experience becomes so utterly extraordinary that it could be named spiritual to be this is important stuff and I have absolute confidence in it. If you ask me well, what's the object of reality reflected in touch sight sound feel image dog. The sensory experiences. We have so I say I don't know. Could I make a wild conjecture sure, but it would be a wild conjecture, not something that I would speak with a lot of confidence and certainly not something that I would try to convince any other human being up. If I were to make a wild conjecture as to what's really out there. I would guess that. Every touch sight sound feel image talk experience that we have is actually an experience of. Everything. Everything all together in a way. That the human brain is not. Conditioned. Evolved to perceive. So we can't imagine what everything at once is the whole causal Nexus the Suchness. Our brains aren't designed to process that. That would be my guess. For what it's worth.","title":"Reality & Sensory Experience"},{"location":"expandcontract/recycle-the-reaction/","text":"I define mindfulness in my own personal way as bringing a threefold attentional skill set to experience so the 3:00 skills are concentration sensory clarity and equanimity. As the result of bringing mindfulness to a sensory experience. That experience might change. The change of the experience that occurs is what I call the reaction. The reaction could be pleasant or the reaction could be unpleasant. The idea in the recycle the reaction axiom is to always remember that. One of the things you can do with the reaction is be mindful of it. So you take the reaction and you recycle it into being an object of the practice that caused the reaction. So that if you can remember that axiom that deals with an awful lot of situations that come up in practice that cause People to have questions because it's like OK, I did this technique and it. Cause this wonderful pleasant experience, what should I do well apply the technique to it. I did this technique can it cause this horrific experience. What should I do well. One of the things you can do apply the technique to the reaction that the technique caused. At a beginning level of practice. One of the Most common phenomenon that People have. Is that they'll do the technique and then they'll go to a certain level? They'll feel like they've dropped into some sort of state and then if they attempt to maintain the technique further. They just are thrust out of that. They pop back into what seems like Square, one. It's like they're just back to ordinary consciousness. I call it the 20 minute glass ceiling, sometimes jokingly you ask People? How long do you sit for Oh? I sit for 20 minutes now? Not there's nothing shabby about sitting for 20 minutes. In fact, you know, I give People an even smaller minimum for daily practice. But People will often say sit for 20 minutes and then it's just time to get up. It's back to my ordinary consciousness again and it's time to get on with the day and whatever. And it's like I'm not meditating anymore. And if I try to Meditate. Beyond that, I'm just into you know scattered mind. An ordinary consciousness, so the reaction to attempting to Meditate. Beyond the 20 minute glass ceiling is your back to the state where you started. So recycle the reaction says that's fine. You don't need to do anything like that. You don't need to get deeper again or struggle to get back to where you were 10 minutes before that. You just take that reaction, it's coming up in feel image talked activity and you focus on that reaction you recycle it. You make use of it and then you will grow. Through that even though it doesn't seem like you have that deep state that you might think is the sign of quote good meditation, so that might be a representative sort of common thing that happens to beginner meditators at a more intermediate level. It's actually sort of the opposite often People will come to me and they'll say something like I was meditating and I dropped into this deep, state and then now when they say, and then I pretty much know what they're going to say. I give it 80% probability that they're going to say. And then I became terrified. In other words, they spontaneously dropped into a deeper state that they never been in and there was a kind of. No self experience. The reaction to that was fear. Which is actually a very common reaction? What to do? Recycle the reaction. Totally. Love that fear to death. No, that fear to death. Just let it happen, it's coming up usually primarily in feel space that is to say the emotional body. So you apply your technique to it, and however long or short. That fear reaction to going deep comes up. You just work with it, then don't that's sort of your task you recycle the reaction. At some point you've worked through the fear you're the depths of your being knows that there's nothing objectively dangerous in that experience and so. You are able to continue to progress another thing that happens to intermediate meditators where they have to recycle. The reaction is as the result of doing the practice. They develop an aversion to being around ordinary People their former friends. Their family because they realize how different they've become and it's like they can't relate. That's definitely an intermediate phenomenon that's not where this practice is mentale. In fact, this practice is meant to lead to the very opposite of that a joy in being with ordinary screwed up people in their screwed. Upness just hanging out with them because you know that you have something to give to them at a subtle level. Just by who you are so if you get that reaction of not wanting to be around non spiritual screwed up ordinary People. Then you See that that reaction is coming up in your own field image talk. And you apply your practice to it until you working through. Among advanced meditators you get this very tricky thing called The Dark night of the soul or the pit of the void. Where everything is very flat it's nice because there's not the horrific drama and suffering that you had before, but it seems like your humanity has been taken away and the old edge and the old fire isn't there anymore. That's also a reaction to this practice. When you bite into emptiness. The first thing you encounter is the skin of the Apple it's not representative of how juicy. The fruit actually is so if you sort of freak out because the Enlightenment is a bleak side to it that you watch your reactions to that. You work that through you recycle that reaction and the true spring and bounce and vitality of the void will eventually manifest itself within you.","title":"Recycle the Reaction"},{"location":"expandcontract/reparenting-our-freaked-out-infant-noting-all-vanishings-gone-in-pure-feeling/","text":"I was focusing on Vanishings and the Vanishings became ubiquitous just like it's everywhere. But in the past when I've noted vanishings say with the breath. It's actually been a sort of soothing experience with sort of an afterglow of peacefulness, but I found this experience of noting banishing to be highly agitating. I think the implied question is what does that mean and what should I do? Uncomfortably stimulated agitating, noting noting nothing whatsoever has resulted in a lot of uncomfortable something. How closely correlated would you say in a certain amount of guessing may be involved on this? How much correlation would you say there is between the? Fact that you were noting vanishing and the fact that you're sort of hyped up In other words does it seem highly correlated with that that really had something to do with it or does it more well the potential was there and I might be hyped up because of other things. I'd like to eat to make a guess is it because you said it well. I'm sort of excited about this prospect and that and I haven't had the sugar fix or the coffee fix so it's not that but it might have been some other things you sort of intimated so. Do you think that the noting of banishing played a large role in this or? Other factors may have entered in and the answer not sure at all is completely valid. So there there's a pretty strong correlation between the paying attention to nothing, and a lot of agitating something. That's good. Now that's what I wanted to determine or may be uncomfortable but it's good as far as practice goes. Is it mostly well you report a lot of talk but would you say that the agitation is primarily in feel image or talk if it's primarily in field? So I don't want to put words in your mouth so correct me. If this is wrong, but the just that I'm getting is. I was noting vanishings, which usually is a peaceful experience for me. But this time and I usually note vanishings. Justin the breath. The ends of the ends and out breaths or external sounds but. 2 things happen this time that are very different first of all the vanishing globalized, too. It's like everything's vanishing. And Secondly it was agitating and specifically agitating at the level of pure emotion in the body. That more or less nail it. OK, that's called precision and we have a vocabulary that allows for this kind of precision and now that I've hold it down to that I can give a pretty confident answer. With regards to the two implicit questions, which is why is this happening and what should I do about it? Why it's happening is because you really did the technique well? The vanishing points us. To the most. Primordial primitive experience that a human being can have. Which is a non human experience and actually the ultimate grounding? Groundless grounding. However. If it points us to the ultimately primordial or primitive experience that any human being can have so primitive that is not human. There must also be. The second most primitive experience that a human being can have. That's pretty close to it. And that is definitely a human experience. And that is the experience of primordial chaotic feel of the infant. You died. Of 1000 little times team or little deaths. Into the Ganz. And when you came back, you came back as a little infant body. With freak out chaotic feel. And. Uh. That's really, really, really good. That's the good news why? Because well that in and of itself wouldn't be good news. But that combined with the fact that you're an experienced meditator is very good news. Because then you just note feel, and it's vanishings. And you'll be working through the first thing that separated you from your spiritual source the very first thing. In the first weeks and hours of life. You get to work at that level. And. All you have to do is note feel an it's finishing. And all the other vanishings. And you know the quantum see right now, you're an adult meditator. Then you were a helpless infant. Now you gotta super at all, you're better than an adult. The adult meditator will apply the technique of noting feel an will note vanishing and include the feel vanishing in that technique and the adult meditator will therefore work through that primordial level of freak out of the infant. And that's the linchpin on the freak out of the adult. And, of the teenager and all the intermediate levels. From infant to adult. Sasaki Roshi says that the first thing that happens. After 0 breaks apart. Is expansion and contraction pull in opposite directions? And they? Cause a creation of a cleft of pure space. But because expansion is pulling out and contraction is pulling in that space vibrates. And it vibrates into pure. Heat of feel. Joan accent in Japanese Joe means pure feeling on alloyed with anything else and netsu means heat and he says if you can detect that that is the beginning of the self. That's the primordium of self. The true primordium of self is the space. And the source of the space is space lus. But the first thing that is in some sense of self and not impersonal is that pure heat of feel. And if you can detect. And complete it. Then the part of it that came from the expansion goes back to expansion the part, they came for contraction goes back to contraction. And the freaked out infant becomes its cosmic parents. And that 0 is re established the next gone. And you are that and you do that long enough you will have completely re parented yourself. And the adult that then will arise from that process will be called an enlightened human. So. OK, the comment was I was thinking of taking a nap. But now maybe I should sit. Uh. Either is fine. Either is fine. There's a case for either one need to take your ego death in manageable doses. Don't worry, it will probably happen again. Or maybe that's a do worry. I don't know, but that it took a long time, but that's The way I like to work to really. Find out what's going on, I don't like to shoot from the hip as far as answering peoples questions. But you see how we pinpointed exactly what was going on. We had a precise vocabulary. And I gave you what I would consider to be an optimal response strategy. And we're done.","title":"Reparenting Our Freaked Out Infant - Noting All Vanishings & Gone in Pure Feeling"},{"location":"expandcontract/retreat-farewell-may-2009/","text":"Our retreat will be ending tomorrow. We came here, mostly what we were doing. Sodom. Which means work on ourselves for ourselves? When we leave we should continue our sodom. I mentioned the factors. Needed for success. A short term investment to learn some terminology and concepts a short-term investment to learn one or more. Focusing techniques. A long term investment to apply those concepts and techniques. Actually, a lifelong investment to apply those concepts and techniques in daily life. And the establishment of a rhythm of day-to-day practice. And periodic retreat. So this is retrained. Why do we come to retreats? Several things not just one. One thing we build up momentum all day everyday what we've been doing practice all our waking hours. I've been practicing and stillness in motion in life. A momentum builds up. That will often take us to new levels. But if we didn't back it up with day-to-day practice than those might be peak experiences. But if we back it up with day-to-day practice. They tend to be plateaus from which we can then grow more. As a tendency. So momentum is important. An important reason why People do retreats. Another thing that happens at retreats is we get social network and social support from the other meditators. We also get an environment where it's easy to practice. Relatively. Of course, the name of the game is freedom. So you have to be willing to practice in environments where it's not easy to practice also. And then we get contact with teachers. People that can give us input into our practice, we get private interviews different kinds of contact with teachers. When I sent the factors that you needed. I mentioned those 4 things you might have might have thought well something's missing communities missing. The teachers have a say no that's implied in retreat for most People. The source of social support and peer support and the source of professional input comes when you do retreats. And then many teachers will give you a contact that you can contact them in between retreats. Upon leaving the retreat continue your sodden. The other side of this practice is safe, a service. We talked about that. I'm leaving the retreat services very big because. You're going to be teaching. You're going to be doing a lot of teaching. I'm leaving this retreat. Maybe you're saying wait this is the first feature diver did what do you mean I'm going to be doing a lot of teaching? Well, you know that I define teaching in a very Broadway. Anybody that changes as the result of doing this practice that change in their life is a teaching that's a sermon to the People around them. If you are changing for the better as the result of this practice, then that means you are teaching because you just carry that with you. That's the subtle level of teaching. Then there's the descriptive level of teaching. Hopefully you've thought about how you could describe this practice 2 People. And when People ask you. Hey, what happened at the retreat you can give a coherent description. Of. What is like? That's a kind of teacher. So you will be teaching. Some of you are moving into the more explicit role of teaching actually showing People what to do. And that's wonderful. So. Continue your sod in AM. Continue your safe. You know the The. Idiom. I hope it was as good for you as it was for me, you all heard this right. Well, I hope this retreat was as good for you as it was for me. This was really good for me. Because of you. Working with you the privilege of working with you. Of contributing to your growth. You folks did a lot of quality work here.

You already know the big picture. We do this for our self and we do this for others. People go through a certain education process in school and usually at the end of school. It's OK. I'm sort of done the education piece. So life is sort of a school for People. And at some point, most People reach a point where they have the perception well, I've sort of. You know, I'm.

The Buddhist perspective called a Nietzsche or impermanence. In terms of expansion and contraction in early Buddhism. They talked about a stage in ones practice where after paying very close attention to sensory phenomena ones awareness becomes dominated by the perception of. Sensory events, rising and passing the word in Poly is good, I'll buy a bhudia means coming up and VIA means passing away. You combine them together and you have the word daya baya so there comes a time in ones practice where the sensory clarity is so great that you're aware of the risings. And Passings of sensory events and that dominates your awareness. A stage after that. Is an awareness? Not of sequential rising and passing but an awareness that no sooner does something arise, but it's already passing. And this is described quite clearly in the classic text on mindfulness practice called the V sued demoga. The Visuddhimagga was written probably in the 5th or 6th century AD in Srilanka by a man named put gosa. So, in that he talks about this stage where. No sooner is there the arising but there's the passing. Now I'm sure that Sasaki Roshi never read the visit demoga. But he's done decades and decades and decades of practice. It's 102 now he began his practice when he was 14 years old, and what a practice Japanese Rinzai. Zen heavy duty summer. I boot camp. Monastic training from the age of 14. So the good news is he really, really, really has deep experience. The other news is. It's hard to understand what he's saying 'cause, it's just so profound and an advanced. I sincerely doubt that he ever read the V City Monka, but he has had all the experiences described there and has formulated them, though in a somewhat different way. He talks about. Simultaneous expansion and contraction, which is. The same thing that that put the grocer talks about when he says no sooner is something rising, but it's also passing away. So it's right there in the ancient literature, however, if you formulate it as it is done in the Poly in terms of rising and passing. Then. There is the danger that there's going to be. A meditator over here, observing the rising and passing over there. And in fact that would be a common criticism that then People might make of mindfulness practice well the expansion contraction formulation. Solves that problem. Because. Now instead of its rising and passing at the same time, you have the notion of which allows for a 2 dimensional thing over here that I'm observing back here expansion and contraction is 3 dimensional. It's all encompassing when something arises. It arises in 3 dimensions and that includes The Observer as part of the arising. The Observer is rising is expanding into existence and contracting out of existence simultaneously as opposed to a 2 dimensional thing that you observe it's now a 3 dimensional thing that you participate in so I would say the main innovation of Susac Euro sheet is formulating. Impermanence in terms of expansion and contraction and the notion that. If you simultaneously totally give yourself to the expansion and contraction. You become the expansion and contraction and then there's nothing but expansion and contraction at some point. They cancel each other out into a flat line of 0. Which is the unborn the primordial state of the source then there is an abiding in 0 until it re polarize is when it polarizes once again in between literally in between the forces of affirmation and negation. The forces of life and death. In between are born the feel image talk perceiver and the touch sight sound world. Both of them are born simultaneously in the cleft that surrounds self and world. This gives a model for how consciousness works and it allows for an experience where? You participate in expansion simultaneously expanding contract you end your world simultaneously are born in between the cliffs of life and death and then life and death cancel out into 0. And you go back to 0 and then you in your world come out of 0 again. Born in the cleft in between expansion and contraction and then that Cliff collapses back into 0. And this is the cycle of. Impermanence, which Sasaki also calls the activity of the Dharma or the activity of consciousness and so forth so I would say is main innovation is this 3 dimensional paradigm. That vastly broadens and generalizes the early Buddhist notion of impermanence and actually gives innocence of mathematical formulation. For what's going on in consciousness as far as the main difference between his teaching an mine. He has you experienced this through koan practice? what I've done is I've taken his model. And I have mounted it within the noting practice of Burmese Vipasana. To me that makes it more systematic and available to a larger audience. So instead of the sort of Intuitive, but very energetic. Zen koan approach. I take a more prosaic. Algorythm IC, noting technique that I got from Burma and divide the divide into a sequence of steps starting with just focusing on. Ordinary experience and then breaking it up finer and finer until by small manageable steps of noting certain phenomena. I can bring the average person to actually experiencing this very advanced paradigm of expansion and contraction. So I would say that in some ways. I'm very much part of the modern world in that. In the modern world we have cuisines and music forms that are called Fusion where you take 2 traditions and you fuse them in a way that's harmonious So what I've done is I've fused the most creative of the contemporary Japanese Zen Masters with a Burmese form of attentional skill training. And sort of so it's a sort of. Bermo Japanese Fusion that was created by Jewish science geek.","title":"Sasaki Roshi & Burmo-Japanese Mindfulness Fusion"},{"location":"expandcontract/sasaki-roshi-the-complex-number-system-the-source-of-love/","text":"Sasaki Roshi makes a lot more claims about his paradigm, then I do. You may be right. I only claim it's a useful way to analyze how consciousness works moment by moment. He implies that it's more than that that it's a universal grand theory of everything. You could have a look at everything that is in terms of. A paradigm of. Mutually contrast ING. Activities that can cancel. Into a neutral and a neutral that can polarize into mutually contrast, ING activities. He says this is sort of like the way everything works. It is not inconceivable that. In 100 years 200 years 1000 years whenever. Finally, a single unified grand theory of everything is hit upon that it turns out to have something to do with. Binary contrast that can. Cancel. There's some hint that that might be the case because. So far our best model for everything. Is the complex number system? Our modern concept of number. And the complex number system consists of 3 types of contrast. That each one of which can. Neutralize. To a non contrasting state. There's The multiplicative domain, which is a stretch squeeze thing. Used red squeeze or Nothing moves, which is 1 * 1. Or you can multiply by a number whose absolute value is less than one that. Squeeze things you could multiply it by a number of absolute value is greater than one that will stretch things. If you multiply by one, it's a neutral element. Then you have the additive domain where you can move to the right move to the left or not move at all, so or front back Top bottom or any direction of anything well in the complex plane. It's a 2 dimensional thing In other words, move in One Direction move oppositely in that direction. They cancel out that's. Additive 0 and then there's a rotational. Component in the complex numbers where you can. Turn to the right turn to the left or not turn at all. TS Eliot. Talks about the spirit as the dance. Except for the point the still point there would be no dance and there is only the damn. If you look at a dancer what do they do? Like Martha Graham writes stretch your arms are ring neurons in OK. This sort of stretch squeeze but they also move up or down. They jump, they moved to the right they moved to the left turn to the right turn to the left all the actions of the dancer. Are actually quantified? With our modern concept of number also turns out that the quantum weirdness. Is in a sense of consequences of the our modern kinds of numbers the complex? What are called the complex numbers? The waves that are complex waves allow for these weird things to happen among them, something coming from nothing. Which is rather extraordinary? But the neutral state. The can be a source. Of polarized something. It is possible that he's right. Uh. Who knows only time will tell. But the fact that our number system seems to be built on. Binary contrast that can neutralize 3 different flavors of them, actually. The fact that he says consciousness is this contrast, ING neutralizing activity. Could be that this? Is pointing towards a grand theory of everything? The whole point. In experiencing This. Is that it's analogous to? The peristalsis of a formula swoon. And as you begin to experience yourself. An and the world coming from this doing and returning to this doing. Even though The doing is impersonal and empty. It's Also. A source of unconditional love. When we contact it. It has that affect on the human part of us.

If you're not familiar with what's meant by self inquiry. Actually, it is a range of traditions that teach it. Including San some Zen teachers, but also many People working within the Hindu tradition. The nondual tradition and so forth basic idea is you're constantly asking a question like who am I or what am I. Whatever comes up. You're saying well who's experiencing this? What's experiencing this you're having a thought well? Where did the thought come from? Who's thinking. This thought it's an approach that's been discovered. Independently, in a number of cultures used all around the world actually as I mentioned there's some sent teachers that teach it. And there's also within the Hindu fold, and People not affiliated with either Hinduism or Buddhism would give you similar kind of model as I say they all have the same basic ideas like. Turn consciousness back on itself turn awareness back on itself that would seem to be a very different practice from mindfulness mindfulness asks you to sort of keep track of what's going on? However, if you really look deeply into what mindfulness practice is about. You will see that there's an interesting symmetry. Between self inquiry on one hand and mindfulness on the other hand. It is true that the initial experiences that a person has when they do mindfulness can be described as. I'm so I'm a meditator over here, observing stuff over there, however, with time. A cop 2 very significant things take place. One is that the habit of meditating begins to Meditate In other words, there's not so much that sense of. There has to be an eye here. Doing the meditation there's a momentum of. Concentration sensory clarity and equanimity those 3 things a momentum of that builds up and it just carries itself, so one important change that takes place with time with mindfulness practice is that sense of. Effort ING and thinking that you initially needed in order to observe things that goes away and the there is just the observing just declare it well if you want to call it observing there's just the concentration clarity in equanimity so that's one change a second changes that you develop a sensitivity. To what's called impermanence now, sometimes impermanence. Can be sort of continuous or vibra? Tori or WAVY but another aspect of impermanence is noting the moment when things vanish. And if you read the classic visiting marked up for example, the path of purification written and probably the 5th century in Tremont card by put the Cosa. He talks about a stage where your awareness is dominated by rising and passing and then a stage where your awareness is dominated by just passing. They just aware of endings endings endings in my vocabulary, I have People noted as gone OK. It's nothing Mister Gosh Mystical, you've all experienced that you pay attention to your internal conversation as soon as you notice that op arises own advantages, OK, mental images. Disappear sounds come to an end. It's no big deal, something everybody experiences, but you can reach appointed your practice with that. You become really, really aware of how many vanishings. There are and things that you thought were quite solid. So at some point you just noting gone well. The place each time you're noting Avanish Inge. For just a moment your attention is adverted that is to say turned twords. The source of consciousness. Because we are something goes to when advantages is where it comes from when it arises. So if you want to turn the attention towards the source. You could take one of two strategies. You can say a has arisen. Now let's look back and see where it came from. That's one way to go about it that would be the self inquiry way. And it's very powerful it works very well for some People. But it doesn't necessarily work well for everyone. Another way to go about it. Is well instead of a is arising? Where did they come from constantly asking that another way to go about it? Is it has arisen? Now a disappears. Watch a disappear. And that spot is going to be where be arises from. So you watch the vanishing peace and if you want to be present at the theory instant of the rising of B. You can do that by noticing the Vatican better shape of A. The thing that preceded it. That's gone of a is the origin of B&B meaning any two successive sensory experience is bigger small that's what I meant when I said that there's a kind of symmetry between the two ways of working. So within the mindfulness tradition, there is actually something that. More or less corresponds to self inquiry and its hugely hugely important, but it's not done with the model of.

Which serves as a Buddhist FA Q? FAQ document. Or might be in some ways looked upon us a Buddhist catechism and it's called the questions of King Melinda. It's in the pali literature, Melinda was a historical person. And uh Interestingly enough, although his questions are recorded in Buddhist literature preserved in SE Asia. King Melinda was a Westerner. He was King Monandrous. Who was Heart of what was left in northwest India after Alexander the Great died there were these Greek. Rulers. We say India but this is India in its broadest sense it would now be part of Afghanistan actually but Rea where his Kingdom was centered and this is sort of early dialogue between E and West. Because he asked a series of questions to a Buddhist monk named Nagasena. Before this whole discussion starts nagasena asks the King are you willing to have a discussion with me and perhaps have disagreements. And whatever and even debate are you willing to do it, the way an academic would do it. Or are you going to do it, the way a King would do it. And how to say this is what do you mean is it well if academics have a disagreement in one sort of gets the better of the other shows them to be incorrect, it's just. You know they just accept that if the King is shown to be incorrect. He executes you so which way are you going to do it like an academic or like he's like you're going to do it like a kid. I'm outta here. You may have been and are hot, but he wasn't stupid OK with regards to the preservation of his nose. So. The King says who? Are you and whatever and he says. Well, I'm called Nagasena, but there is no thing called magazine. Then the King tries to sort of trip him up on something and so that nagasena makes this metaphor. That's very famous in Buddhist literature. He says well your Majesty when you arrived here? How did you get here? Well, I was in my chariot? And then he goes through all the different parts of the Chariot. And he says, well is there really a thing called the Chariot. Is? Are the wheels the chariot at the hub the bed. The axletree you know? The yolk etc? Etc goes through all these parts and the King has to agree no that's not the Chariot That's not the Chariot and then not as in a says. And it's the same with us. There's just rupa. Vaden our sons now thanks Kara and Pigeon. That doesn't constitute a self called Nagasena. And the Kings sort of gets it in this in this scripture says OK. You're right you know you went on that one. I guess I can see your point. The point being that Chariot as a thing is just a convention. Actually, I find the are Hot Magazine's argument. Unconvincing. Myself. Does that sound arrogant and irreverent? If it were really, really, really convincing. Then all the philosophers of the world would be saying. These guys are right. But in fact, there's a lot of philosophical objections to this argument. If you get some professional philosophers in and let them get to work on it, OK, they might really tearing apart. I think he's right there is no thing called itself, but not just quite sure that this particular metaphor clinches it as a proof. The way. It is portrayed is doing in the scripture. And I would like to clinch it for the world, so that there are no quibbles and our objections and everybody agrees can't deny that. I would like to suggest. Another way to. Another angle of attack on this idea, I agree with the idea. And I think it is one of the most important ideas in the history of the world. One of the things that. Is noticeable in this argument is? That Rupa means the physical body. It's not a sensory experience. We know it exists through a sensory experience, but it's not being. Presented as a sensory experience. Being presented as a concept body as matter. Samskaras are not direct sensory experiences for most meditators, they can be for some meditators you can directly experience it consciousness as. An entity in its own right as opposed to consciousness in a certain flavors such as taught side soundfield image talk that's not ordinarily experienced by most meditators. What if we? Just take the parts that are direct sensory experience. Why would we want to do that because well direct sensory experience as opposed to concepts? Can be brain damaged? My idea is let's take. Either broadly beta not to me. Body that is to say physical and emotional sensations, so that would be touch field. As they do within the Cubicin Lenny Edge or let's really look at the most gripping part of ETA now, which is the emotional type pleasures and pains that we go through. Just take the field part and let's make sanjna or concept, not a concept, but a sensory experience image talk. So let's sort of. Streamline the model. To feel image talk. Now I didn't just. Like pull this out of nowhere. There is an implication in my original School of Buddhism, Xinggan, which is a form of a driana. That. The sense of self arises through mental image internal dog and body sensations because the practices that are done in Xinggan to have an experience of Oneness with the deity involve the physical physical type sensations in the form of mood Roz. Mental images when you visualize the deity in front and also yourself as a deity. Then you visualize your surroundings as the Palace of beginning. And you replace your internal talk with the Montrae. And then you get the emotional feeling of the deity whatever that tone is. So there's an implication that. Body image talk broadly. And feel image talk more narrowly that these are sort of natural. Building blocks of identity. If People. Tease apart the feel image talk, which is there's nothing conceptual in that that's completely a sensory skill. They get the same insight. Oh, there's just feeling Woodstock. There's no thing called the self here. So that's the way I have People work with this. Now instead of using a classic metaphor of the chariot I use a? Much more homey like. Like your TV set or a computer monitor not the. Not the liquid crystal once but the the CRT ones. That's my metaphor.","title":"Sensory Clarity - 1 of 2 - No Self As Thing"},{"location":"expandcontract/sensory-clarity-2-of-2-no-self-as-thing/","text":"You're watching TV and. There's like. Something white on the TV screen. And this is assuming it's a CRT cathode Ray tube. And I come in and I say. There is no thing called white on that screen. And you say are you crazy just looks white. And I say Are you sure? Here. Is a magnifying glass? We agree that this magnifying glass. Does not change? What is there? It does, however increase resolution. Resolution is the ability to separate things that ordinarily fall together in perception. That's all that resolution means you all know the difference between a high resolution screen and a low resolution screen. The large amounts of data coming through allow for separation of points that truly are separated, but they would tend to fall together. So we go up and we look at the white an lo and Behold as we get closer. The perception white goes away and the perception red, Green Blue arises. The Buddha said if you look very carefully. The perception I am goes away in the perception of 5 aggregates of identification arises or in another. Formulation the perception body goes away and the perception 4 elements earth water air fire arises. Another metaphor chop up a cat if you can believe this it's in the Buddhist Scriptures. It's like you can't believe this is there, but chop up a cow and you imagine chopping up a cow and public in modern India. Well, apparently in the booth next day. It was done and get you in a bit of trouble. If he said supposing I suppose a butcher went to a public square. And took a cow and begin to drop up the cop at some point, the perception power disappear. At the perception meat would arise. That's actually in the pudding scriptures? What he says, is it's even more interesting. He doesn't say just any butcher. He says Suppose a very skillful butcher really knew what they were doing where to very skillfully chop up this call. Then I guess if you don't know what you do with the presumption mean won't arise perception. Oh my God? How will go away, and the perception me Quillen rocks. So I think you see like letter for here. The perception white goes away and the perception red, Green Blue Horizons. Well, I would claim that. When you look very carefully and at least your cores subjective self of thought and emotion. The perception. That that is a thing and I am it. Will go away? And the perception feel image talk that aren't me. Will arise? So that's my metaphor. Why I? Think that this is worth looking into is this is 100% a perceptual. Research project. There's nothing Conceptua Linnet. It's not like you're conceive of the 5:00 aggregates like Oh yeah, there. There must be habit forces within man. Yeah, there must be a thing called consciousness. And, yes, there's the physical body, etc, etc. This is a phenomenon of perceptual psychology. And therefore is amenable to the research methods that we would use for any other sensory perception. We don't know. How red green blue? Mix to produce something that is not none of them. To Whit White, we don't know how the visual system does it, I mean, we know. In some vague ways, some things about the circuitry, but we do not really understand how an illusory emergent property arises. But someday we will. It is possible I am choosing my words extremely carefully. It is possible that when a person resolves IM nacin to feel image talk. Something like the resolving of white into red, Green Blue takes place notice. I said something like I don't know 'cause. We don't know about the Red Green Blue thing. Is white there or not? What do you say about something that disappears as soon as you look closely and reappears as soon as you're not paying constant tension? What's the existential. Status of that white doesn't exist well if you don't look carefully it does. But then if you look carefully it doesn't so. And sort of exists, but doesn't exist. Something like that may be going on when People that have used my methods. Get. A sense of Freedom from their limited identity. The perception I am a thing goes away and the perception field image talk are rising. Horizon. If indeed these are analogous then it is now possible to turn the lens of science. On that perceptual shift, it well, it's not now possible but it will be possible in the next 50 years 100 years 200 years. And maybe we can come up with a very convincing argument that yes. Indeed, the put down was right and Nagasena was right. If we were to take this metaphor further. If we were to go beyond the perception red, Green Blue. And deeply penetrate. What is red green and blue light? When it's light coming out right there's 3 different flavors. Or colours we call it. If you ask what do they all have in common? At a deep level what's red, green and blue light? What's light? What's colored like? These are waves of. Radiant electromagnetic energy. And from the Point of view that they're radiant electromagnetic energy they're just different frequencies of the same phenomenon. But the word vipasa not means vipasana it means to. See separately in the sense of separating out strands. But we In addition to apart tivi positive needs to see a part. But V as another force as a prefix, it means through or into. So first you re posted on the sense of separate the strands. But then your awareness soaks into those strands and you start to experience feel image talk as vibrating space. Which is sort of interesting because radiant electromagnetic enerji if you ask her physicists they'll say well. It's sort of vibrating space. Now I don't know how far we can take this metaphor. I'm not not so naive as to suggest that it's anything more than an interesting parallel, but it is an interesting parallel so. After you teased out the strands. The. Concentration clarity and equanimity go into the strands at the strand stuck to present themselves as vibrating void. And then there's no distinction between feeling which talk because they just vibrating void. The focus in technique. Harkins back to the early Buddhist notion of. Separate the strands and then penetrate the strands and see their empty impermanent nature.","title":"Sensory Clarity - 2 of 2 - No Self As Thing"},{"location":"expandcontract/sensory-clarity-untangle-and-be-free/","text":"This notion. Of. Sensory clarity. As a vehicle for insight. And Liberation. We don't have any historical record. Uh this before the boot up. Although he said there were boot does in the past, etc, etc. Basically, the idea is. You. You take the sense of self. And you break it down into components. Now there's a lot of ways, you can go about this before grade elements before foundations of mindfulness. The five five aggregates. There's a lot of possibilities. A lot of ways that the Pi can be chopped up if you're more on the I don't know scripturally oriented side you're very concerned with the particular sets of categories that are used. Are too? To untangle the web of limited identity, but for me, I'm not so concerned with the categories themselves as the general idea. I think it's one of the? Most significant discoveries of our human species. A parallel discovery took place in the West and in fact, is one of the things responsible for the domination. Of Western culture. But in the West, the principle. The principle of separate the strands that you can understand how the thing works and gain a handle on it, that principle was never applied internally. But it was applied externally to the external natural world, in many, many domains starting with the Greece. And the Greeks gave us a word for that process. It is a Greek word. That means to break something up in order to understand it and be empowered. Analysis. Analysis now implies some sort of. Intellectual. Formulation. I'm going to analyze the situation, but originally the word analysis meant exactly what those those morphemes mean invent take the complicated thing break it down into its pieces see how the pieces interact with each other and you'll understand how the complicated thing works. It's dividing conquer stratagemma impair. The strategy of if you can untangle if you could find out what the fundamental. Dimensions of the system? What are the primes? What are the atoms? What are the components? That are involved in this system, they were going to get a handle on it. The W eventually. Discovered that. The whole natural world could be analyzed in terms of mass. Length. Time thermodynamic temperature and electrical current their interactions. Um. Will give a complete understanding of the natural world, at least as known to modern physics. But it took centuries and centuries and centuries of contention argument confusion to finally be able to define these components of the natural world, but it allowed for the arising of physics and physics allowed for. Better ships and that her cannons and better machines and that allowed for the domination of Europe over the rest of the world. So. The W use divide and conquer in order to conquer the material world. But in the E the Pooter discovered dividing conquer in order to conquer unlimited identity in order to conquer are. Are suffering? And the screwed up behaviors that come from our suffering. He was called a conqueror some People don't like the dividing conquer they don't want to think the conquer is bad, but actually. One of the words that was used to describe the put the less Gina. JINA and that means the Conqueror 'cause when he was born. The court astrology are was called in by his father, King Shoot Nodena. the Buddha was born in the country. A. Cast, which is the Warrior Caste of India. And the King asked the court astrology? What do you foresee for my son sitar to? The Astrology said Your Majesty, you given birth to an extraordinary child. He will either stay in the Palace and conquer India. Which for them went conquered the world jumping to bebop meaning expand your empire from being a little clam up in NE, India to like you're running the show now. Or he will leave this Pallas and conquer himself. Conquer his limited identity and make his mark in history that. His father wanted him to come to the world and so try to keep inside the Palace. So this notion of if you want the more gentle formulation untangle and be free. If you want the more. Sharp formulation divide and conquer. This is sensory clarity. The 3rd component of mindfulness and as far as I as I mentioned as far as I can tell this was like. A unique discovery. And was central to the development of a whole new direction in human spirituality. These are skills concentration sensory clarity equanimity are skills that can be developed with time.","title":"Sensory Clarity - Untangle and Be Free"},{"location":"expandcontract/shinzen-young-and-soryu-primal-feel-and-the-zen-keisaku-2-of-2/","text":"Sorry.

I actually went through a similar. Experience so I don't have very much new to say, yeah, I went. Into the temple. And for the 1st. Period of time that case, I could actually seemed. Maybe this isn't the same it seemed kind of fun. I was I was young and. Felt very tough. Stuff and I was good at meditation and all this and I liked it that I was in a tough place with People who had hit me and. And it was kind of fun and there came a. A point when. Which I actually talked about earlier today? When I started to notice how distracted I actually was I'd never noticed because I was too distracted to notice. TS Eliot distraction distraction by distraction so I was distracted. To the point that I? Sometimes believed that when I was thinking. I'm pretty good at this and not noticing that I was distracted from my meditation. When I was thinking how good I was at the meditation. And there came a very. Horrifying really transformation when I notice that I actually couldn't keep my concentration in my estimation at that point for even. 1 second couldn't keep my mind on anything for a second and I started to have a great deal of insecurity and it was really at that point when the keisaku turned into something horrifying. And then the person would carry the case acuin at least for me. The self talk was all negative about them. What's this terrible person doing trying to hurt us and? Wreck this monastery with violence and all of that. And it was, it was really quite awhile before I managed to work through that in a similar way, though. Horado Roshi actually began to regularly carry it for a long sit. He would carry it very slowly through the Zendo and it was that presents that it really felt as he moved it. You mentioned that wave it was, it was like it was there was just a force of such enerji penetrating. There's penetrating my body. Penetrating and in particular would penetrate my legs, which were in extreme pain early on, I decided I would only sit in full Lotus. I don't know why I decided that but I decided to only sit in full Lotus and that meant that I was in extreme pain pretty much all the time. Definitely the most pain I've ever experienced. And as you would walk this. This this sphere this like a like a son. It's like a comet. It's just like this. This amazing. Force of power would move and would start to kind of penetrate my body and there was so much resistance to the pain and to the. Keisaku, coming that I would resist that power which made it hurt so much more and it wasn't until I really just freaked out one time as he was about to hit me. It wasn't until that happened, I would I was shaking you understand just shaking just just and trying to bow like this just it was just it was just unbelievably terrible. It wasn't until a point there when it's just too much and it's just easier to not. Do that anymore just easier not better not Oh good, I'll I've got a great idea. I'll stop resisting not like that. It was just I just can't anymore. Just no and so. At the moment it. It penetrates finally. Sometimes I say it's sort of like going to the bathroom when you really have to you. Finally, just let yourself. You could finally go to the bathroom and it felt kind of like that, but just coming in and flowing through. And then It is uplifting it's just it's just uplifting you feel kind of like you're floating so I actually came back also to the US and I was using it. I actually haven't really used the case. I could that much here. And I don't think we shouldn't. I don't. I don't think it's a good idea to make it seem as if. This is sort of like you know war stories or like this is a heroic device or something. It's not it's just it's just a tool. I don't think it's I don't think that a system that uses it is has has everything going right to not use it is just great. But today will show you how it's done. Sorry I have to deserve it right.

There are behavioral challenges like procrastinating or I'm smoking cigarettes. I want to change the behavior so I called those behavioral challenges. Then there are what I call sensory challenges, which are. For because of some condition some sensory experiences arising in the body in the mind. Insight sound and so forth and that's an uncomfortable sensory experience, so it's a challenge in that sense. So, in my general formulation I would say you're experiencing a sensory challenge and that challenges uncomfortable touch to finding touch as physical type body sensation. Essentia Lee when a person has a sensory challenge, they have. 3 broad categories of strategies that can be applied. You can either turn your attention towards the sensory challenge and bring concentration clarity and equanimity to it that would be sort of turned torrents and you're sort of Perfusing. The sensory challenge with mindful awareness second strategy could be called turn away your concentration to focus elsewhere on to something that's pleasant for example, you can focus on restful states or Focus on the Sound of Music or positive emotions and so forth and I call that a turning away strategy. A third strategy is that you can pay attention to how things change. And it's sort of not this too shall pass, but if you look carefully enough. This is passing moment by moment and the passiveness of it both in terms of the sense that it's moving and flowing and in terms of the sense that each piece of it, sort of falls away moment by moment. You can become so absorbed in the change. That pretty soon. You're just aware of change and you're not aware of it. I'd call that strategy focus on change, so you can turn twords. Or you can turn away or you can turn towards you can focus on change the tendency is to think well if I. Turn towards it, I'll just make it worse so I don't want to do that and then well if I turn away from it. I'm just avoiding and denying and suppressing so I don't want to do that. and I know it's not going to change because it's rock solid so what's the point of that. So then the person is set themselves up for failure. Although it is true that it may temporarily get worse. If you turned towards it. If you really give it what it needs In other words, experience it fully 'cause that's what mine from where this is, is a full. Experience of something. Pretty experience it fully it make it worse, but then it will break up and then People say, well. If I turn away on denying but to turn away you have to develop concentration because it takes a discipline to focus on something other than the sensory challenge and you're not suppressing the sensory challenge. You're giving it permission to be there. You're just not intentionally focusing on it, so you are bringing equanimity to it, even though you're not paying attention to it. And you are also developing sensory clarity to learn how to detect a pleasant restful state while you have a huge. Pain and emotion state you're learning how to detect subtle pleasant things that may always be there that you might not have noticed. The turn away strategy is valid and as you're turning away it may cause. The thing to sort of cool out the sensory challenge to cool out of it, then, when you use those same skills that you've developed by turning away then could apply the concentration clarity equanimity turned towards the more cooled out version of it. It may be more penetratable so the focus away is absolutely illegitimate. As legitimate is focus on and as far as well. I know nothing changes. It solves the Rockwell. How careful you have worked if you microscopically. You might start to notice Oh yeah, well let's changing but it's trivially changing so lot, but then as you pay more and more attention to that it's like Oh well actually come to think of it and then that theme of flow and banishing starts to dominate awareness. I have noticed. Actually, I've noticed change. It is constantly. Changing the physical disk on physical discomfort is it possible to describe the type of change that I mean? It might general word for continuous changes flow and then if something disappears. I say it's gone, or has managed. Some of the flavors of flow that People experience are sort of like away Venus. Some People get like a bubbly vibration kind of thing. Some People get sort of expansion or contraction or sort of both at the same time, like something sort of like pushing out and pulling in at the same time? Is it possible to characterize the flavor of flow experience inside the edginess it's like there's. There's needle sticking amount like millions of them all at different times and all the different places, but roughly in the same area, but you know just instantaneous little * * of a needle and and so it's kind of like little bubbles. Almost sounds pleasant. It's not pleasant 'cause. It's **** but it's it's. It's like that in the sense of you know little pops. Yes, that's a strategy that we might take we might choose to focus on change based on what you're reporting. Do you understand the 3:00 basic strategies turned towards turn away or focus on change those 3 sort of basic options now if we choose to turn away from the discomfort. We could either focus on restful states like relaxation, physical relaxation or mental blank mental quiet that kind of stuff that would be 1 turn away strategy. A second turn away strategy would be to focus on positive. Thoughts are positive emotions like sort of hold positive image or positive feeling the body or have some sort of positive talk in your hand so we could focus away from what you're doing what you're uncomfortable touch onto either pleasant feel image. Talk states or we could focus on to restful states so that would be a focus away if we did a term twords we would. Pay attention to the touch itself, but we might also look for feel image talk reactions. That might be suffering present that if we do focus on change. We're going to explore ways that your sensory experience is constantly changing not only the sensory challenge. But like other places, because when one part of the sensory system starts to flow. Other parts will often flow so even if you're. Pain is solid if we find flow in some other part of your sensory experience focus on that. Sometimes it spreads and breaks up. The solidity in the painful areas. These strategies all makes sense. In this sort of techniques that we would use for each one are clear to you. Yes, that's good now as you can see. They all sort of work. But you may have a curiosity or preference as to where you'd like to start. If we do turn twords we can either work just with the touch of the pain itself or we can work. Just with your feel image. Doc reactions to it. Those would be the 2:00 turned toward strategies. The to turn away strategies would be focus on pleasant respite states or actively create positive thoughts and feelings. And then have a focus on change will be will find change wherever we find it emphasize that and then see how widely that spreads does one of these, particularly appeal to you. I I think the focus on change. Let's explore that that could be very interesting, OK, good are you comfortably seated yes, OK good. So I'm just going to do my own practice. As you do yours, so I'd like you to take a moment to life in your spine and let your whole body settle.","title":"Shinzen Young Guides a Student with Physical Discomfort - 1 of 4"},{"location":"expandcontract/shinzen-young-guides-a-student-with-physical-discomfort-2-of-4/","text":"Let's begin by turning your attention twords the itchy sensations wherever they may be in the body. And I'd like you to focus in on. The sort of prickly change. The fact that it's sort of like popping and bubbling kind of thing. Just focus on that. Uh there's these sort of constant little. Sparks or scintillations. Get interested in that for a moment. And I'd like you to. Label that with the word flow. And I'd like you to say flow out loud every four, five, six seconds to acknowledge that you're focusing on how the itch is changing continuously does that make sense so will call this, noting the flow with spoken labels and I'd like you to do that now for a couple of minutes. By listening to the pace of your labels and the tone of voice that will give me an idea of how you're working with this experience. Hello. No. Hello. Flow. Hello. Correct. Their pacing of your labels is excellent I'd like you to. Change the tone, though a little bit. More to a kind of gentle matter-of-fact impersonal quality in the voice, it may seem artificial, but it can influence consciousness, something more like this. Long. Loud. That kind of quality and then in between the labels your intently focusing on that flow and then you reac knowledge with the label and you use the gentle matter-of-fact quality in the voice to remind you to be gentle and matter of fact with the sensation that that's using the voice to induce equanimity does that make sense. Yes, excellent so I'd like you to do it that way. Cloud. That's perfect. Now. Shift to mental labels think those words. Or that word but as you think that word let your mental voice. Also have that, gentle matter-of-fact tone to it, and that will constantly be reminding have equanimity. The tone of the labeling voice induces equanimity. The even pacing not too fast, not too slow guarantees concentration. And then the precision of the words that you use to label the phenomenon that guarantees the sensory clarity, so can you see how the labeling process sort of guarantees each of the 3:00 components of mindful awareness is that concept makes sense to you. Yes, excellently so now I'd like you to continue to note the flow using mental labels. How's that coming Lori? It's coming, it's really slow down. Is there more of WAVY quality to it? Or you say it slow down? Yeah, there's the I think the prickliness is sort of softened and it's turning you know more WAVY. Would you say that the WAVY sensations? Are pleasant unpleasant or neutral? Yes, I hope so neutral. I'd like you to focus in on that. And. That means to the extent that you focus on that neutrality. You don't have the sense of discomfort is that correct so keep focusing on the sort of massage of that WAVY flow keep noting it as flow. Open up to it, and sort of think of it as a kind of massage. That at worst is neutral. Um. Could potentially at some point actually become pleasant? But as long as it's at least neutral you're focusing on that movement. And you're less caught up in the sense of having a physical discomfort that. Notion make sense yes excellent. So keep doing just what you're doing you're doing great. Is that WAVY flow still present? It is it's being sort of challenged by this pulsing it's starting to assert itself. And is the Pulsing literally the pulse from the from the circulation of blood. I don't know I don't feel it more. Close to my elbow, which is not generally place rated feel a pulse and the Pulsing is a a painful sensation. It's neutral too. I'd have to say it just but it's a little distracting. Yeah. Could you interpret the pulsing as a kind of flow? Yes, it's just changing the pace like it's more so you could add the Pulsing as part of the neutral flow. And is there anything pleasant in any of the flow at this time or is it still more or less a neutral thing. I think there there is a degree of pleasantness to it. Is it possible to describe in? What sense the flow is pleasant? It's just because it's it's really slow and almost calming. Good I'd like you to use your concentration power to focus on how the flow is pleasant. And let that sort of massage you nurture you. Take you deeper and deeper. Comfort you. But also sort of energized here so it's. It's a kind of positive energie for you. Just keep noting flow now if you wish you can drop the mental label. And just do it moment by moment with direct awareness. Or you could reinstate the metal label if you get a little spaced out and if you get really spaced out. I'd like you to start speaking the labels out loud again. Does that make sense? Yes, so that's sort of like a quality control? If you go up the Hill or go into first gear speak the labels and use the voice. The way we did the pacing the tone and so forth. If you're In our lab. Just sort of. Ha. Driving along you know you can use the. Going to a Into the mental labels and if you really get on a momentum you can drop the labels going to cruise control. And. Just do it after wrecked awareness. That makes sense.

It really slowed so it was almost stopped, but then I noticed it was moved. When it stopped was there a deep tranquility within you. Or it's just stopped it will serve sort of after. Afterglow. Or not, and you know it was more like the pulsing kind of although the Pulsing is kind of still flow, but it was not the gentle. Flow it kind of took over for a bit OK, there was looking for that, gentle flow. And then it sort of showed up again. Excellent very clear report. And you're continuing to be able to experience the flow as. After pleasant kind of soothing thing so. You're essentially experiencing widespread Poison Ivy as a soothing. Flow of energy is that true. I have to say yes, it is. And yet we did nothing. Other than focus on just what is? So that's pretty weird. OK, I'm assuming it's mostly in your arms that we've been focusing is that correct or if you've been focusing wherever the Poison Ivy inches are. I was focusing on on the flow and I have to say that it sort of wine into my app domain as well. Like sort of involved my torso in my arms is just spread In other words that is a characteristic overflow experience. I'd like you to see how widespread within your body you can find phenomenon that could come under the category of flow. There could be tingling or waving in your legs. Your arms your torso your face. Expansion and contraction inward pressures outgrew pressures see how wide spread through your body. You can find things that might come under that category. This sort of take an inventory through the body. Yeah, now that I've sort of opened up my search. It is all over. It's fairly global in the body. I'd like you to. Zoom out and cover your whole body with awareness and focus in on the flow. As encompassing your whole body that's excellent sometimes, this is the way it happens. It's funny isn't it whoever do that. Severe Poison Ivy could be so much fun who would have ever thunk it. And you're particularly sensitive to the Poison Ivy is that correct it seems I cannot deny that I am very sensitive to it. Where you doing, great work? Able to get that sense that your whole body is sort of flowing yes. Now we're going to up the challenge level considerably. I'd like you to keep your awareness in the body. And if possible on the flow. That I'd like you to open your eyes but sort of defocus your eyes try to just sort of softap focus so you're not too drawn into external sites. And see if it's possible to maintain some contact with that flow with your eyes open. The opening of the ice could intensify the flow it could. Cause the flow to so to become less where it might have no effect at all. But does this instruction makes sense. Good I like you to try that. Able to maintain some sense of that with your eyes open. Some sense of it, the pulse kind asserted itself again. But there's still a bit of a presence of the flow, as well. Even with your eyes open, yeah that's fantastic. So this shows you that you can maintain this in life. It doesn't have to be just the rot when your eyes are closed necessarily you could maintain it as you're going about daily life. You might be able to maintain some sense of it awareness of that flow throughout the day that makes sense. At least as a theoretical possibility good, I'd like you to close your eyes again. And. I'd like you to bring your attention to your mind for a moment. We're going to go out of the body. Bring your attention to the area in front of behind your closed eyes sort of your mental screen does that make sense. If we were to ignore mental images and colors that might be there would be left with dark brighter. Grey is it mostly dark for you, mostly bright or mostly Gray. Mostly dark. I'd like you to focus on how the pattern of dark and bright is changing their constantly changing does that make sense. It is moving right. Better. Big dark brightness. Is that correct? Moving I mean, like shifting it, perhaps in very small ways or that's not the case. It's yeah, moving in the sense that some of those bright spots are fading and then coming back and that's what I mean will consider that to be flow. Inside that blank so I'd like you to note that as flow. And if there is any vibration inside the blank. The dark for example, if there's any like bubbly or whatever number that is flow also. Somebody sounds, Actually, no could you say that again well when you look at the darkness brightness behind your closed eyes. It could be perfectly stable or it could be moving in, some way. Would you say it's perfectly stable or there's this movement of some sort there? There's movement will call that movement float does that make sense and I'd like you to just focus on how the visual phenomenon their flow. And if you happen to have any mental pictures of things. If they move or change or melt or morph will consider that flow also so we're going to sort of look at flow inside, either your mental blank screen or any mental pictures that might be present now of course, there might be times when there is no flow. Everything might be perfectly stable so only note flow if something changes, if it doesn't change them, then just. Stay there and that things be stable.","title":"Shinzen Young Guides a Student with Physical Discomfort - 3 of 4"},{"location":"expandcontract/shinzen-young-guides-a-student-with-physical-discomfort-4-of-4/","text":"Did there continue to be flow in mid space? Yes. And as you focused on it did it have any soothing qualities or not particularly. Who is more neutral? I think OK not particularly see but you could detect the movement? I would like you to move your attention back into your head where you might hear internal conversations. Which will call talk space? And are things pretty quiet right now or is there chatter present. A little there's a little chatter, but it's it's pretty pretty quiet sometimes when things are quiet in talk space there can be a sense of the kind of undercurrent of enerji kind of rumbling or. Whispering with deep down. Below the Conscious talk. Every experience that in the past, you know what I'm talking about like you did, scope out and see if anything like that is present. Right now may or may not be if it's not there. That's fine. You don't think it's not like an assignment to find it, but we're going to just see if there's any of that subtle vibra. Tori flow that pre pre conscious talk thing. OK anything like that at this time are things produced pretty still and quiet. I had some then I had to to visit me for awhile and then there are some. Top expressive so there's not a lot of that vibra. Tori's subtle flow at this time is that correct OK fine. Bring your attention back to the body. And see if the flow is still there with regards to the body. Yes. Actually. So. Any questions about what we did so far, no see if now we're going to go through the same exercise see. If you can keep contact with the flow with your eyes open. Yeah. Axel and now we're going to go to the next challenge level see if you can keep contact with the flow and make eye contact with me. So it's more like that ordinary type situation. That's a lot you ended it excellent so. This is pretty cool. Any final questions or comments. No. Anytime in your life in the future if you have physical discomfort. You can remember that, you can do things like this and what I was doing is I was doing exploratory work. I was like asking you questions seeing what was going on and then based on that I would like change the guidance and suggest certain things. 1st we checked out some local flow and then we found that it tended to spread through your body, so I was looking. I know that that's a tendency doesn't always happen. But if it does happen, it significant because then the person could get this sort of whole body massage thing. Then I took a look to see if there was any fluidity in your mental experience at this time. There wasn't any of anything. Not and that doesn't need to be, but sometimes mind space will also flow. If that had been the case. I would have had you broaden your focus to zoom out and cover like the whole mind and body as a single flow field. But that wasn't the case and we didn't need to do that are you still experiencing it now in the body. I mean, you got your moneys worth right. Just definitely I mean, the huge smile indicates the taste of purification in a Freedom from suffering so that's excellent work, so that's how it goes any final questions or comments.

And I would like to welcome you to my YouTube channel. Literally, welcome it is well that you have come if you're watching this you probably have some interest in what might be described as the spiritual path. It is good when a person comes to the place in their life where they are considering taking on the practices of the spiritual path. Obviously, there are many approaches from which this can be done. At this YouTube channel you'll hear me describe one of those approaches. It's an approach based on what's called mindfulness and it takes as its model that the spiritual path is kind of cultivation of skill set. It's exercises in a sense that will allow you eventually to both see. Beyond the self and the world and to an optimal way improve yourself and improve the world I would say that those are the 2:00 basic themes of deep spiritual path see beyond yourself in the world innocence get over the self in the world and at the same time improve the self in the world and see, those as complementary endeavors when you can see those. Does complementary endeavors? I would say that you have reached spiritual maturity mindfulness as I'd like to define it is a threefold attentional skillset involving the gradual development in a natural way of concentration power sensory clarity and equanimity. It turns out that when you develop this skill set. Which by the way anyone can develop with time practice and competent instruction? When you develop this skill set to a certain critical degree. Which once again anyone can do given enough time ordinary experience becomes utterly extraordinary it becomes Spiritualized in the Christian tradition this is sometimes referred to as the practice of the presence of God, meaning that you don't have to go to church anymore because you can't get away from church. Every place you look is a beatific vision every sound of the world is a sacred him. Every ordinary sensation in your body is the massage of the spirit so that's ordinary experience experienced with an extraordinary awareness that's the essence of the mindfulness approach. Within mindfulness there are a number of. Different traditions different ways of developing that skill set what you'll learn from me is. Eclectic I've drawn from a couple of the Burmese traditions. But I've also been influenced by something that is historically not part of mindfulness, which is Zen and also vowed Rihanna but I've taken the influences from those Vodrey on if you're not familiar is practised primarily associated with Tibet. I've taken from those traditions, but sort of. Wolven them within the framework of the mindfulness way of working why I like to use the mindfulness framework. Is for several reasons first of all it's possible to present a really deep and complete spiritual path within the framework of mindfulness without there being any specific religious doctrines involved. You can just extract it from the background. Historically, the background is Buddhism. There is certainly a thing called the Buddhist religion. But you can extract the mindfulness practice from that thing called the Buddhist religion and make something that is acceptable to anyone. I don't know if you can hear in the background. But they're chanting mass where I am right now. We're at the Carmelite Spiritual Center in Niagara Falls, Canada. I'm running a mindfulness retreat. Why is it that these Catholic priests welcome us? Well, they realize that we're teaching something that. Is certainly compatible with their Christian contemplative practices. The Carmelites are meditating or contemplative order and they know that we're not trying to Convert People to Buddhism, even though our technique is derived historically from Buddhism. We're not trying to convince People to believe in reincarnation or to worship icons of the Buddha or something like that. We've extracted the essence of the practice. The concentration clarity and equanimity skill cultivation. We've extracted it from the doctrines. The I'd like to say we give People. Hardware and will let you run your own software your own philosophy, which could be Judaism Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, or radical secular. Marxism could be whatever you want. So we give you the hardware. You run your own software well. I find that the mindfulness framework makes it very easy to do that. Also, the mindfulness framework allows us to discard the. Cultural aspects that are associated with Asia. I just came back from Israel where Iran a retreat that was. At 90 Israeli People there, they were all Jewish but there's actually a law in Orthodox. Judaism in some of those People were Orthodox that you're not allowed to have any statues any idols in the land of Israel. Well, that's not a problem that's just cultural. Piece of baggage from Asia, it's not central to what we do you don't have to chant in sino Japanese or with chopsticks in order to attain enlightenment so the mindfulness framework allows us to extract the essence from the cultural background, the other thing that I like about the mindfulness framework is that it is very. Harmonious with science in fact, it's basically like science, the nuts and bolts of science is to track how much of what? When and where interacting in what ways and changing at what rates those of you that have a background in science, technology, or engineering know what? I'm talking about it's the nuts and bolts of science. Well, it turns out that the nuts and bolts of mindfulness is essentially identical except applied to sensory experience. How much of what? When and where interacting in what ways and changing at what rates with regards to your experience of self and world. So it fits the mindfulness perspective fits very well with modern science and is amenable to study through the methods of. Neuroscience because we can extract from the doctrinal background. We can extract from the cultural baggage and we have something that is not only compatible with, but actually potentiates the scientific point of view for those reasons. I like the mindfulness perspective on the spiritual path so at this channel. That's the perspective that you'll be getting and I hope that you'll find it useful and can apply it to the nitty gritty of your life and your external behaviors.","title":"Shinzen Young's Welcome to New Viewers"},{"location":"expandcontract/shinzen-young-the-science-of-enlightenment-book-trailer/","text":"What if you could approach meditation practice with more ease and less struggle? What if you could tap into the intellectual joy of understanding the science behind it? And what if you could use that joy and clarity to work smarter in your practice. You discover that nature is constantly providing windows to transcendence and you get even more mileage out of your practice and its application to your everyday life. The concept of enlightenment would be within your grasp. It's often said that the things experienced by advanced meditators cannot be put into words, but I disagree. And I've dedicated the last 40 years of my life to the Endeavour of creating a precise in Iaccessible language for describing what happens as the result of deep meditation practice. By working smarter and knowing how to spot nature's windows of opportunity. More People will have the tools to benefit from meditation and more People would flourish in their existing practice. Imagine how that could change our world. In my senior year of college, I studied abroad in Japan. During that year. I was befriended by some Zen monks. I sensed that they had a kind of secret sauce away to be deeply happy independent of conditions. Eventually I decided to discover for myself what they were talking about. I knew I would meditate my whole life and probably eventually get good at it. But I was also impressed by the power of modern science and technology. So I decided to train myself in physics and mathematics, as well. I currently divide my time between teaching meditation and designing research related to it. I derive great joy from discovering parallels between mathematical structures and meditative experiences. And I like to think of myself as being on a mission to take the missed out of mysticism. Many People are quite pessimistic regarding the future. Degradation of the environment senseless violence economic chaos and political extremism. All seemed to bode ill for Humanity in this century. Of course, it's impossible to predict the future. But there's a very real possibility that the marriage of the best of the East and the W could pull the bacon out of the fire and lead to a dramatic improvement of the human condition. This reasonable and reassuring thought fuels my days. What if informing meditation with the spirit of science ends up creating the tight Geist for the next century? I wrote the science of enlightenment to bring that dialogue to a broader audience and I invite you to join me. And take your meditation practice further than you may have thought possible.","title":"Shinzen Young - The Science of Enlightenment (Book Trailer)"},{"location":"expandcontract/sight-space-how-detecting-shifts-can-lead-to-flow/","text":"The sources of Shiftings in visual experience.

There's a core relaxation that takes place in the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm muscle. And that's automatic on every out breath. You don't need to make that happen. You just need to notice that physiologically it has to happen or the out breath won't occur. So when you breathe out in that local E in the core of your body there's automatic relaxation. As that's happening if you sort of spread awareness, to all the whole body is also settled the length of 5 lens. The two arms and 2 legs in the head. So then that's actually an example of zoom in and out on a restful state. That the rest fullness from the core spreads and effects the whole body, so each out breath just. Completely inundate you with physical relaxation.

If they're going to. Get caught some place that's going to prevent them from becoming enlightened it's going to be in allocating. So much time and energy to finding the right map, the right model for my teacher, the right situation. That there's little time in Enerji left to actually do the practice. So we might call that the map trap. The second trap on this speaking broadly. About the spiritual path is what we might call the fundamentalism trial. You buy into a mythological system. That allows you to make. Dramatic and significant improvements in both your happiness subjectively and your behavior object if Lee. Even small positive changes in a person's life in terms of being happier subjectively and behaving better objectively. That's what I mean by positive changes even small positive changes in a person's life are. Very very difficult to come by ask any psychotherapist. To have huge positive changes in a person's life quickly dramatically. That's not a small thing. Something really good happens. The problem is your intellectual horizons have now become closed the very mythological structure that allowed for these positive changes. Prevents the next stage in positive change the antidote for not getting caught in a good place for the fundamentalist is too. Realize what I just said. If they can't. Let's say that you do a meditation practice, you can. Achieve states of common concentration and that's certainly a good thing. But year after year after year that's sort of where you're at, is it down. Everything is sort of. Train full time passes quickly you get up your refreshed. But that's about it. Well, that's a good place, but It's you can go beyond that, to a better place. So we might call that the tranquility trap. The antidote for that particular getting caught in a good good place is you take these blissful tranquil, States and then you clarify them by distinguishing different flavors of restfulness that brings a clarification component into the tranquility peace. You think that you're going closer and closer to the source by exploring the world of Archetypes. Special powers leave your body experiences. Former lives you name, it, it can be a good place, but it can also limit you. You think you're making spiritual progress going deeper and deeper and deeper towards performance source, but actually you've turned 90 degrees. You're now on a trajectory that's at right angles to going down to the source of consciousness, but you don't know it. You're going out out out exploring the power problems. If you deconstruct the realm of Spirits Mindfully, it will take you to spirit. And that's the anecdote to the realms of power trap. You interpret the experience of the power runs as a sensor event just like any other sensory event. Our bizarre you treated as though it were but now. Add you apply concentration clarity at equanimity to it as you would with any other sensory event and that then allows you to go deeper and deeper and deeper towards not the realm of spirits, but. The role of the great spirit shall we say that form was doing that are Macaya. It can happen that you get classical enlightenment period is the real thing. It's permanent. You've seen the note self, but you think you know more than you do. And you come out even start teaching from that place and that's another good place you can get caught in. Enlightenment is of many faceted. Jewel you can see it from many, many sides in my experience. It's a continuum of vast continuum with many facets a person could easily miss some of those facets. Just 'cause you seen the no self. Doesn't mean you? Don't have a long, long way to go. To become truly liberated from your old habits? What should we call it. The Enlightenment trap. Well, they antidote to that is the courage to take feedback from other teachers. And to find teachers vastly senior to yourself. To take feedback from them. Constantly take feedback from your environment one of my teachers used to say kill nor Satori Wabash Tunnel, much if I you may know sartori. It's the Japanese for awakening today's enlightenment is tomorrow's mistake. Meaning you have to be constantly willing to move forward. The Observer Trap is the characteristic weakness in the mindfulness way of working now that doesn't mean. That, it's a show stopper. It just means when you work with in that way. You have to be aware that this could be a problem and you have to be aware of what the antidote is what the fixes. 2 parts to the fix the 1st is to bear in mind. what I just said that there is this possible danger. If you're not aware of this possible danger then. You know you might fall into that trap. So you know that this could be a possible danger, but then how do we not have that happen. Well. Think about when you learn to drive a car assuming you have learned to drive a car. When you first. Attempt to do it, I remember when I first learned to drive the car was on a stick shift. And it took so much effort and I had to think about everything I could just barely do it and I thought to myself, I'll never be able to operate. This car and do anything else, I'll just have to be constantly thinking about 2 dozen things I have to be constantly thinking about. But you know what after 6 months I'm just. Bopping, along on the freeways in la that was singing to the radio munching on a burrito. Talking to somebody and it's rush hour traffic. Small log it's chaos. Ann. No problem. What happened? The. Fact of having driven so much. Was driving the car In other words, the driving became second nature? Mindfulness practice. Develops concentration sensory clarity and equanimity. At first you have to think about it. And it takes a lot of effort. At some point, the concentration clarity and equanimity start to go on autopilot. Then. The subtle mental images. Subtle internal conversations. And subtle emotional sensations in the body that. Create the sense that there is someone meditating that there is a self directing this process. Those sensory arisings. Start to get in folded within the momentum of the concentration clarity and equanimity without the need for more of them to be directing the process. In other words, just driving metaphor, the habit of driving eventually can drive your car. So, in the mindfulness metaphor, the habit of mindfulness eventually meditates. You. And seeps around and dissolves the sense of a meditator. And that's how it works.","title":"Six Common Traps on the Path to Enlightenment"},{"location":"expandcontract/sleep-interruption-a-good-night-s-rest/","text":"Sleep interruption on the meditative path is actually. I would say not uncommon. Particularly at retreats, but it can also sort of spread into daily life. We can look up on the meditative path as. A journey from the surface of consciousness to the source of consciousness. Another way, we can. Look up on it is that we are sort of pouring concentration clarity and equanimity from the surface down into the depths actually those 2 metaphors refer to exactly the same thing. If we take the second metaphor that here we are on the surface and we're sort of shining the flashlight of mindfulness on the surface of consciousness and some photons are trickling down into the depths. Giving the depths what they need to rewire themselves. If we take that metaphor, then it's not surprising that. There should be some interruption in some impact on sleep, sometimes as the result of meditating a person may find that they sleep deeper an better than they ever dreamed possible. Other times, there could be exactly the opposite effect. There's consciousness inside the sleep. You don't really you may have difficulty falling asleep or there's still awareness going on during the sleep and so forth. I should say that the long term effects will be to sleep. Uh both deep and consciously so if in the short term, you find that you're not sleeping deeply because some consciousness is coming in there, then there's no need to freak out there's a very senior vipasana master named SN gohan cop. Who teaches in the Uber kin Lenny edge of Burmese be personal? He gives some very good advice to students about what to do, if you have any disturbance in your sleep patterns. He says do 2 things 1st. Continue to lie down with the body very still so that the body physically gets rest. In other words, don't flail around don't get up actually don't even get up and sit and meditate make sure the body gets well rested by being lying down and still that's Guideline number one guideline #2 Make sure that consciousness gets rested by maintaining a continuous meditation technique. So those are the guidelines. I give to People if they get disturbances in their sleep, due to the practice as I say it's not inevitably. The case that you're going to get disturbances like that. Meditative practice may make you sleep deeper than you ever dreamed possible. But on occasion. It could have the opposite effect in fact. The guidelines of keep the body still in relaxed and keep consciousness engaged in a meditation technique. I apply not just to the effects of meditation in disturbing sleep, but it's my general guideline for anybody. That's having insomnia or difficulty sleeping for whatever the reason maybe including emotional turmoil or physical pain or just some sort of sleep disorder. I say Part of the negative cycle that People get into is the. Have difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep and then they're freaking out because well if I don't get a good nights sleep. I'm going to have a crummy day and then worry over that further agitates and prevents them from getting sleep. So how to break that vicious cycle is a cognitive re framing instead of the notion. I've got to get a good nights sleep you. Entertain the notion I've got to get a good nights rest, which may or may not involve actually losing consciousness. It's possible to get a good nights rest without losing consciousness at all, and in fact, in very experienced meditators. That's indeed what happens, I had one Taiwanese master that I lived with for about a year in southern Taiwan in the city of Tainan. And he attempted never to lose consciousness at night, he would would sit for 4 hours. From 8:00 to 12:00. And then he would lie down for 4 hours from 12:00 to 4:00. During that period when he would lie down. He would maintain am udra like this, which would be a biofeedback device. If he lost consciousness. It would collapse and wake him up and he attempted every single night to spend the entire night conscious, but deeply deeply resting and I've trained people with chronic pain and whatever who can't get to sleep. Really ever very well, I trained them to get depressed keep the body still keep a technique going so if the disturbance in sleep happens for any reason, either because these photons are trickling down, causing the unconscious to rewire itself and so it you have weird dreams or difficulty sleeping or just. Whatever the cause, maybe that's disturbing the sleep in terms of dreams or not or not falling asleep So what you do is you simply keep the body still and keep your technique going and as the result of that you will train yourself to get deep rest good rest and in very experienced meditators. Yes, it is true the difference between waking and sleeping sort of goes away In other words, like the Christian Mystics used to stay in the Middle Ages. Eggo Dormio set core Mayan Viggle. It I sleep. But my heart wake. Auth you have the depth of sleep, but there's consciousness there. And that is very fulfilling state of consciousness to put it mildly.","title":"Sleep Interruption & A Good Night's Rest"},{"location":"expandcontract/some-examples-of-working-with-images-and-image-space/","text":"The perception of. Sort of I am body. Eh. Doesn't just come about through body sensation although body sensation is primary? You often hear me say subtle is significant. There is typically a subtle mental picture of the outline of the body and I think that's what you're alluding to is a subtle mental picture of the outline of the body. AT and then there is the body sensations. That sort of fill that picture. You could think of the sensations that touch feel you could think of them as being the honey and then the body outline is the bear the container OK and the honey more or less conforms to the bear. But of course, sometimes. Honey is not inside that but it can be around her pod, etc, etc. So that the bear considered sometimes become more larger and spherical so I think of the? Image of self the visual image of the body on and also it's often your facial expression. The clothes you're wearing all of that is, is part of it. That could be called image of body or image of self as opposed to sensations from the body. Now the perception of. Sort of like the bodies of thing. Comes about Through Nebbiolo Citian Viscosity in the body sensations. And in the image of the body. So as you as you sort of love if if you hate the presence of that image. Thinking Oh, this is getting in the way of a no self experience. Then you're going to be in big trouble, but if you start to love that image to death. Now you're bringing clarity and equanimity and perhaps even intentionally focusing on just that image for awhile well. Guess what that's going to break up into flow the image. And the sensations are going to break up into flow and the image in the sensations will become one integrated flow and that will breakdown that subtle sense. That I am the body if at some point, the image is not dealt with. Let's put it that way, either dealt with consciously by being focused on or dealt with because it's just a quantum ized. Quantized into fluidity even though you didn't focus on I prefer to focus on it. So I like People to learn how to work with that image have a complete experience of it work, but the sensations have a complete experience of them work with the 2:00 at the same time, and that tends to breakdown that subtle sense of self. Often, there is a subtle picture of where we are the ambiance. That can be worked with individually. Concentrated on clarified economized until it flows. When the if your eyes are closed? How do you know where you are? Sound. And the image of the source of the sound and the memory images of where you are. If all incoming sound and the image of the ambiance are a single flow field. Then you will not be limited to a certain time and place. You know your Location in the universe will become an fixated. And so the idea is. The first challenge is to. Do what you just reported which is to detect that this is indeed the case. Second challenges and not to hate the presence of those subtle images because what you resist persists as far order Ehrhardt said. So you work with them and you sort of a firm them. Into oblivion. Counter intuitive that phraseology is and so when you get all three sort of basically. You've got the self image related to the body. You've got ambient imagery related to your memory or your idea about where you are, and typically triggered by sounds or enhanced by sounds then you've got the memory plan fantasy imagery that tends to be in the center of image space, which is the portal into the imogo Monday or the stored. Images of The world. It's the surface of this giant storehouse of visual information that at its deeper deeper levels. Shades into the world of myth. But its surface is whatever comes up. You know quote on the mental screen is memory plan fantasy that kind of thing, so if you penetrate all 3 image locations. You take care of. You might say that does it work let me think. Not sure what I'm going to say. In terms of image. I would say that the present. Is a rising in those ambient images in the image of your body? And then the Particularly the past. Is sort of in the center of image space? At least that's the portal into the stored images? But as I say. Yeah. Future can also be there 'cause, you can fantasize about what could happen in the future and myth is there. The Archetypes are there at a deep level. It goes out from our world to mythological worlds potentially? Uh. So each one of those locations in image space is associated with very powerful work. When you do have a driana practice. For this so-called visualizations, which are really. Touch field image talk exercises. Uh the you visualize yourself as the deity so you replace the self image with an archetype. You visualize the deity in front of you facing you in the memory plan fantasy center of image space and then you replace the ambient images with Celestial Palace or Madolora Yantra or something. So you deal with that and sure enough, they hit each one of those 3. And replace the ordinary with the mythological. Not in order to be insane or possessed but in order to gain insight into how consciousness works our perception of. Where we are, and who we are rises? So it's an insight practice. Now, Having said that. I made it sound like. Rogeriana discovered my categories, but of course, it's the other way around. I didn't figure. This out OK. I was my original training was invade Rihanna and they had us do this right and then later on, I realized well. Of course, they have us do this because this is the way. Ordinary perception occurs so obviously if you're if you're playing with consciousness like Tinker toys taking things apart and put it back together. This would be the way to do it, so I got the hint on it from my training. Apropos of trauma when when I have People that. Have traumatic memories come up or where the IT say What do they call it a flashback? Where they think they actually it's like happening now? Why that's happening is that the ambient imagery? Which should reflect present reality physical reality that ambient imagery has disappeared and been replaced by the memory imagery. So once you train People to detect the ambient imagery. And they can see the interplay of how the present imagery starts to go away in the memory imagery occupies that location. That's like hugely insightful and liberating for People.","title":"Some Examples of Working with Images and Image Space"},{"location":"expandcontract/spiritual-teachers-behaviour-feedback-ethics/","text":"One often hears stories of.

You've never hear of them and the great majority of them have made stunning and radical overall improvements in their lives, although there are still areas of. Uneven growth, I think we shouldn't have unrealistic expectations about teachers. Well then how is it that these teachers have this uneven growth that there so strong in certain areas but innocence stunted in other areas. I think that the main cause of this is some combination of unwillingness or inability to get feedback from other People on their behavior. So what do I mean by unwillingness or inability well sometimes things are set up for a teacher in a way that they actually can't get feedback from People because they are put on a pedestal and students automatically assume that if they see some flaw in the teacher that it must be a flaw in the student. The traditions sets things up that way so there aren't actually feedback loops to the teacher who is the teacher going to get feedback from well. Another more senior teacher if they're willing to put themselves under and keep themselves under a more senior teacher even when they themselves are relatively senior. If they're willing to do that, then some feedback structure will be in place. But many People are not willing to do that, after 30 or 40 years of practice. They want to be completely independent. So then who's going to give them feedback well their world is primarily the world of their students. So they would have to get feedback from their students, but their students May. Have a mindset that. That the teacher is better than they really are, and therefore be afraid or unwilling to give them feedback well. Then, who will give them feedback well, maybe their family will give them feedback. But if their family is not their student or not a meditator. It's easy for teachers to dismiss the feedback of People that. I haven't had a lot of meditative experience, so that's the unwillingness to take feedback. So some combination of. Inability to get feedback and unwillingness to take feedback if you maintain that consistently you do run the danger of having blind spots. In your development so I think it's of the utmost importance that a person from the get go decide that they will listen to feedback from everyone. Whether that person is an adult or a child whether they're an advanced meditative practitioner or are clueless with regards to the spiritual path. I willingness Annan ability, meaning that the structures are in place, the channels are in place. And you're willing to use those channels that People will approach you on your stuff. Then you take a consensus see one of the problems for teachers is that? An awful lot of the time when students do call you on your stuff actually. It is their stuff. It's the student stuff, not yours, and that gets to be that consumes time in Enerji. And maybe even 8090% of the time it's really them. It's not the teacher. But that 20% or 10% of the time that it is the teacher and that there's something for them to listen to all they have to be willing to invest that 80 or 90% of time, which is a lot of time in general, teachers if they're good at teaching their overworked they don't have any play. Any extra time in Enerji, they're just they're just going 24/7 flat out at least most of the ones that I know that are good at what they do it's a lot to listen consistently too. What the students have to say about you as a person when a lot of that data is not of any use to you. But I think it's essential that you be willing to invest that even though it's it's a bear because there will be patterns consensus will emerge with time about your blind spots and that will help assure a more even growth pattern and in fact. My general approach to ethics. Is? A little different maybe radically different from most people's approach to ethics. I suspect that most people's approach to ethics is that there are certain principles that should be followed. Or maybe certain rules that should be followed. Or maybe in the really extreme. Clayson, an elaborate legalistic ethical system. But that's not my approach at all. I actually say that the four basic precepts of Buddhism, about not taking live not taking what's not given. Not speaking falsehoods and not doing things in the sexual domain that would be harmful to people. I say those are some basic guidelines. I certainly have that much in terms of axioms, but beyond that, I think that the. The main way that one cultivates ethics is an openness a general openness to feedback from all other human beings with regards to how you're carrying yourself in the world.","title":"Spiritual Teachers' Behaviour - Feedback & Ethics"},{"location":"expandcontract/standard-and-advanced-focus-on-rest/","text":"One of my pet phrases is when you say nothing is happening as I'm sitting there. Either literally nothing is happening in which case you are in. You are in cessation. Here in Nirvana itself. That's great or that's not the case in which case 6. Things are happening your body is physically relaxed your eyes are defocused your ears that you focus your body is emotionally neutral your mental screen is blank in your head is quiet pets 6 sensory events are going on. If you pay attention to those as tangible events. Then something is happening. One nothing much is happening. And that brings a clarity component into the experience of nothing. Much is happening and guess what that will now tend to bring a growth component back into the big picture of your practice. The absorption jhana shamatha practice. As it's described represents a thinning out of self in the world. What is thin is penetratable? Will you go into these absorption States and then you penetrate the restful factors or the jonak factors for me. It's restful factors. You awareness soaks into them and what do they become flow and go? They break up into vibrating point. So there's what's called soup. Copypasta non, which is driving parcela where if we put it into my language. You go directly from touch sight sound or feel image talk. You do a direct penetration and it dissolves into vibrating Floyd. That's called drive a personal or there's the absorption path where you get things all thinned out once again my personal language. Instead of touch side sound it's relaxation light silence. Instead of feeling its talk it's peaceful and quiet. Then you penetrate those into Phone call because there are more easily penetrated because they're more thinned a but either way. Sketch into the same result so focus on change once again. Speak enters in when you do the beep a salon whether called the proposal and John's where you're penetrating the jonak factors. So that's why I have to focus on change. Focus on rest. As I like to teach it to People. There are 2 two sort of ways of doing at the standard way that I just described working with restful flavors and then there's the advanced version of focus on rest, which I call? Do nothing but I have a very clear definition of what it means to do nothing OK do nothing isn't twiddle your thumbs and let your mind wander there. There's a certain way to do nothing that allows you to do that. To have that be growth experience and do nothing is my reworking once again a reworking I don't claim these are the same thing. It's modified reworked but it's my reworking of the The Whole. Bundle of approaches that we find worldwide that might be described as anti meditation. In the sense that. Instead of Making an effort. Instead of Engaging in. The Noble Quest. You in the words of one of the teachers in that tradition. Papa G you call off the search. I love that phrase call off the search. You stop. Trying to Meditate and you. Stop trying to do anything and you just abide. Without trying you come to abide. In the nature of consciousness. In the Tibetan tradition this is zone chair and Mohamad draw. In terms of Zen somebody early zan. Tranquille illumination schools of them where they wouldn't. They just like it was a non doing some interpretations of just sitting some interpretations of Choiceless Awareness. Some interpretations of non dual awareness sort of work this way. As I mentioned there's 2 sides to the path and it's paradoxical there's a. A place for bearing down there's a place for easing up there's a place for. Doing something and there's a place for. Not doing anything at all. So, but not doing anything at all, I call do nothing. If I had to say what? What's my model in it as I understand it? Which admittedly certainly not a scholar or a deep practitioner of that tradition. But I have some sense of what it's about and I use my own categories, and so they made. Made something that is based on those their themes. They talk about. The spacious nature of consciousness. But they also talk about the effortless spontaneous dynamic nature of consciousness. I take that effortless dynamic nature of consciousness. To be The. The flow aspect. Even within the sort of do nothing approach. You're not certainly not meditating on change. They're not doing focus on change, but The fact is as you come to abide in the spacious nature of consciousness that dynamism of that, spacious nature presents itself to you. As effortless expansion and contraction. So even the do nothing is not totally unrelated to the themes of focus on change.","title":"Standard and Advanced Focus On Rest"},{"location":"expandcontract/strengthening-a-weak-ego-structure-through-mindfulness/","text":"Sometimes People are. Afraid that if they have a weak ego structure. They shouldn't be practicing meditation because meditation will further weaken that eagle structure. However, and this is ego structure in the sense of ego strength, which is a good thing. However, I would say that it depends on the kind of meditation practice that you do an on the orientation. Because I've had People that come to come to me, who have official psychiatric diagnosis of borderline personality week ego structure, the sense of another person. They lossed all sense of themselves, but not in the good sense, not in the healthy merging sense. But in an unhealthy sense. That was dysfunctional uncomfortable and caused suffering and disorientation what I do for People that are in that situation is just a slight modification of the standard meditation that I give to dissolve itself except with this slight modification. It's an exercise in strengthening. Or in improving ego strength in the psychological sense of ego strength. The problem is when they are confronted with the other. The sights and sounds, particularly or the physical touch from another human being. They lose contact with them selves as I said in not good way, So what I taught them how to do is when the other looms that they keep noting feel image. Talk to keep a strong contact with those subjective elements. The problem was that they were losing consciousness of the strands that produce the self so with a technique. Superficially that looks similar to the first step of the deconstruction of self. I gave I gave them the ability to keep contact with the feel image dog. Even when Strong other arose and just that attentional exercise vastly strengthened their abilities to maintain boundaries and to remember who they were in a psychologically healthy way. So. I think that there's a lot of subtlety involved in this issue of psychologically healthy self. Spiritually healthy self. And so forth and I've found that the sensory categories that I like to use and the focus methods that I like to use can actually be used either too. Deconstruct ego in the sense of. Ego as a problem, but they can also be used to strengthen ego in the sense that ego is a desirable thing in its psychological context.","title":"Strengthening a Weak Ego Structure Through Mindfulness"},{"location":"expandcontract/strong-determination-meditation-sits/","text":"Strong determination sit is an English translation of a Pali expression \"Adhi\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na\". That means that you make a determination or an intention that for a certain period of time you're going to sit without moving voluntarily. It could be an hour. It could be 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours or longer. And in general, there is the issue of sitting for long periods of time, whether you make a vow not to intentionally move or not. I encourage people as a general principle, at least occasionally, to do long sits and/or strong determination sits. I think it's a very good way to push the envelope of practice. There are some parameters of course, some basic principles you have to keep in mind. The first and obvious one, but still needs to be mentioned is I would never encourage anybody to sit to the extent that it causes any harm to the body. Usually, for the average person you would have to sit quite a long time to cause harm to the body in terms of joints or paresthesia of nerves or that kind of thing. I mean abiding paresthesia from having damaged nerves. I don't think that's likely to happen for the average person in just an hour or 2 hours of strong determination sit. But a person does need to be careful that no physical damage arises due to the practice and how you do that is basically you start experimenting and if you do something that causes you to be limping for 1/2 hour after you get up, well that's a sign that you don't want to be doing that kind of thing. So, we want to just deal with the sensations, the sensory challenge that's involved in the long sits. So what's the sensory challenge involved in strong determination sit or long sit? Well, clearly it brings up physical discomfort and that physical discomfort, then brings up mental and emotional reactions, so the mental reactions come through mental images and internal talk. The emotional reaction comes from the emotional type sensation in the body which many of you know I call Feel. Body sensation that seems to a given individual at a given time to be emotional in nature. And then the more physical type sensations; the pain, the fatigue and so forth, the sleepiness, possible nausea. Those sensations. I call Touch in contrast to the Feel. So basically the longer you sit, the greater the intensity of sensory challenge that arises. Physical discomforts become more intense. Your Feel Image Talk reactions to it to them become more intense. So at some point you have a Touch Feel Image Talk storm going on in yourself. Now, to the extent that you can bring concentration clarity and equanimity to that, to that extent, it's going to turn into a flavor of empowerment and purification. On the other hand, by forcing yourself to sit long or sit without moving, it may drive you into a state of concentration clarity and equanimity. So one use for the longer sits or the strong determination sits is it will force you or literally drive you into new levels of mindfulness that can be extremely useful because that then becomes the new set point for your practice. So, sometimes people will tell me: \"Well, I've reached a certain plateau with my practice. What can I do in order to push the envelope to move on to the next level and so forth?\" Well actually there's a bunch of things a person could do. But one of the simplest things they can do is start doing at least occasionally not necessarily every time, but at least occasionally doing longer sits strong determination sits. Dealing with that challenge pushes you forward. I said that there's some guidelines. One of the guidelines is, well, don't damage the body with this. Another guideline is don't get goal driven in terms of thinking that the issue is how much can I take for how long. That's not the issue in this kind of sitting. The issue is how much can I learn and retrain the nervous system. That's sort of your goal. The goal is not like, OK, I gotta make it to 4 hours without moving kind of thing. The goal is, OK, how much mileage/retraining of my processing of Touch Feel Image Talk can I get from what I'm doing. The guidelines are don't damage the body and... Yes, there is a goal but the goal is not to achieve a certain personal records in terms of duration of sit or intensity of what you sat through. The goal is, well, how effectively am I learning. There is something to be gained by bearing down. There is something to be gained by easing up. The main advantage to this is, as I say, that it will tend to push the envelope of your practice in a natural way. Because the natural response to intense physical discomfort is actually to drop into equanimity. But in order to access that natural response, you may have to push the envelope a little bit. For certain people, this is actually a very easy way. Well, no, I won't say a very easy way. It's a relatively easy way to make a lot of progress, a lot of tangible progress. So if you find that you're one of those people, I would encourage you to explore this within the parameters that I mentioned. Remember that if you've got 10 units of physical discomfort, 10 units of emotional discomfort, 10 units of disconcerting imagery and 10 units of negative talk. If you can keep that all separate, you'll have 10 + 10 + 10 + 10, which is 40. If they get tangled you're going to get the impression of 10, * 10, * 10, * 10, * 10, * 10, which is 10,000. Put alternatively, a level of perceived suffering that the average person would say is 10,000 and utterly unbearable, it's fainting, it's kill me now level for the average person. For someone with mindfulness skills. It's not 10,000. It's 40. And that's quite doable. So if you bear that in mind, and explore in that direction, then this can be a very meaningful practice for you.","title":"Strong Determination Meditation Sits"},{"location":"expandcontract/tea-coffee-and-meditation/","text":"Need a few more.

Whatever the causality whether the teacher is inducing it or whether you're creating it all on your own. The main thing to look for that's going to get in the way of your spiritual progress is developing a dependency on a teacher. Now, some teachers foster that dependency. Through some mixture of altruistic and selfish motivations, perhaps. But also students have a tendency whether the teacher has issues, or not students have a tendency to develop dependence on the teacher. So I would say that's the main thing to look for whatever the cause. Maybe MI developing a dependence on the teacher. If so well, then you want to take measures to militate against that because the name of the game in the spiritual path is. Happiness independent of conditions independence, a competent liberation teacher does not want students. A competent liberation teacher wants colleagues. Once peers. Once People that are independent and free free of that whole sort of investment with the individual teacher. So, sometimes People ask me oceans. Then you've given me so much. What can I do to repay you and so forth and the impetus cited me just blurts out? Forget about me that's the biggest favor you could do. Forget I ever existed. Just take what you have learned take the principles. Take the skill set and run with it on your own. Forget about the person that taught you those things, the way I look at it. There's actually only one teacher in the universe throughout all time, and space and it's not a person. It's a doing all the individual teachers are just. Reflections of that one teacher activity mythologically or archetypally. We could say that that would be represented by the 1000 headed 2000 armed goddess of compassion and the individual. I mean don't take the math, literally right. Maybe there's 10,000 heads to historically some bigger than others. But all sort of appendages on the same activity, even that that goddess is not a person. It's just an activity called teaching, which should grow an improve with time, like science does, I would hope dependency on the teacher I would say is. Can impede your progress so watch for that? That's why I sort of like the Zen tradition way of working when you do sons. Uh at least the Rinzai Zen way actually true of Soto Zen, too. But specifically in Rinzai. Zen during a session or intense meditation practice period that typically lasts a week. You have what's called Sunzen Wordoku San. Which is one on one interaction with the roshi depending on the temple or the center that can be? 2 or 3 times a day or it can be up to 5 times a day for most of his teaching career before he got very old Sasaki Roshi used to see his students every single student, 5 times a day. Now I think he's down to 3 or 4 times a day at 102 and there could be 60 students. There so do the math. So they're coming in for the interview, the interviews, though, are not like. Be possamai interviews, where we talk about your practice it explain things in a linear way they're very nonlinear transfer of. On Energie of emptiness from the Roshi to you. You might say when Catholics take communion they experience. The true presence of Christ. When you go in for sons and with a Rinzai Zen Master, you experience the true absence of that master. Which is a kind of dynamic doing a bouncy emptiness? And some of that is transferred onto you by the intense interaction that you have with that. Roshi they never talk about it in explicit terms, but it is a kind of Shakti pot if I were to use the Hindu terminology but. Unlike Chuck Teapot, where it's formalized and they talk about OK. The Guru is going to ZAP. You never talked about in wrens eyes at you, either develop the sensitivity to capitalize apartment or you don't. Also, either figure it out or you don't figure it out, but that's mostly what you're going in there for it's not to pass these koans gets to internalize. The passage the freedom of the Roshi by merging with him or her. So you get this ZAP. But then you have to go back to the zendo to the meditation Hall. What follows the transfer from the teacher is not a big celebration of how great the teacher is. What follows from the transmission of from the teacher is you go back to the meditation Hall, where it's always either too hot or too cold. There's bugs biting you, your buttons are being pushed People are abusing you they're hitting you there yelling at you, you're exhausted you're confused now. Can you apply? That. Hit that you got from. Maroshi can you apply that can you truly internalize it and make it yours by applying it to the nitty gritty of the real world right now? So you're thrown back on your own resources. You don't waste time glorifying the teacher even thinking about the teacher. Whatever you got now you gotta make it yours. And the goal in this training. Is to produce peers? It's to produce colleagues? It's to produce People that are completely confident there confident in themselves so this way of training. The reason I like it is, you sort of get the book best of both worlds because you do get a transfer. But it set up in such a way to make it impossible for you to develop a dependency. At least if it works right whatever that teacher is given. You you have also had to work. On your own very, very, very hard to internalize and apply that. Your spiritual.

One of the difficulties in answering questions. On these topics is that there's quite a bit of ambiguity as to what the words. The witness or the phrase Nondual awareness should refer to In other words, these words and phrases are used differently by different People. And so to give a sort of. Single answer to questions regarding these without taking into account. The fact that the terms may mean different things to different People is the road to disaster actually gross misunderstanding and possibly even contentious. Malaise. So. One can use the word. Witness. I think in two senses. One is the sense that. There is a thing over here. That sort of observing the it's over there and in some way detached from the it's that are being observed. This is one sense of witness. In that sense, witness is just a. Way of describing a certain level of equanimity. And from that perspective, yeah, that's a good thing to have that sense of unjust witnessing stuff is. You know there's the phenomena are coming and going and they can't get to me because I'm back here. I call that a distance, creating metaphor for equanimity. I should point out it's not the only metaphor for equanimity. You can also have a distance collapsing that metaphor, which is I'm so totally with the phenomenon that it can't get to me because I'm glued to it. But in any event if we want to use the word witness in the sense of a metaphor for equanimity that's fine. That is not at all, however. At the same level as? Witness in the sense of. The absolute witness. When you have a sense that. There's Your there's a sort of observer a thing. That's observing or a person that's observing but sort of separate and attached. That's good because it's equanimity, but it's also important to realize that that's being produced by subtle feel image talk. So I wouldn't say that that's the absolute witness or pure consciousness. But it's a good thing it's a stage that People go through, however. It's of the utmost importance that a person not get stuck in that stage and think Oh well this is like? The ultimate goal of things. So then what is? The true witness. In my way of thinking the true witnesses contentless consciousness. That, in my system you directly eyeball for just a brief 2nd. Every time you observe a phenomenon disappearing. In other words, whenever any phenomenon disappears. What is actually happening is that the 2:00 forces that are molding that phenomenon? You can call them life and death or affirmation negation or expansion and contraction. Or, a whole lot of other things. The two forces that have molded that phenomenon. Cancel out. And there is a cessation Nero to. A collapsing or disappearing. Of. Time space. For quote a fraction of a second dance. Of course, the time metaphor right by an external Clock for a fraction of a second. There's a little puncture. In the time space Continuum. Of course, that little puncture eats up all of time and space. It's the black hole that sort of eats up the universe and then spits it out again. In the next moment of consciousness. My teacher Sasaki Roshi calls that 0 that's what I would call the true witness. But the true witness doesn't see anything and it's not back here somewhere because there is no back. There is no forward. There is no extension in time and space. It eats up time and space, not inside time and space. And you when you become the true witness. There's no sense of witnessing anything any phenomenon. Uh there's no sense of anything, it's contentless consciousness. It's nothing whatsoever. Now, some People wouldn't call that the witness. Some People would just call that emptiness or the source or cessation nirodha moment of cessation. If you had to say there's a witness. That's what as in an absolute sense that's what I would point to and that witness punctures. The time space Continuum. Thousands and thousands and thousands of times every day for everyone. The only difference between the so called enlightened People and everybody else is they notice it. And they know that they are that nothing. If you read in the yoga sutras potentially the classic text of Roger Yoga. He begins the yoga sutras by saying. After Yoga Nosha, Salaam. Yogas Chitta Vritti Nirodha her. Octodad roster Swaroop Devasthanam, so after yoga new shason I'm OK here. This is the science of yoga. Yoga is teeth are pretty narrow to the cessation Nero to the cessation of the fluctuations of consciousness. Then and only then. Does the drifty the true observer abide in its nature? So if we wanted to call that nothingness that very special nothingness. The true observer. We could, but that's very different from the sense of there's somebody back here detached watching things in order to go from there, somebody back here detached watching things too. The experience of cessation you have to be able to detect. Uh the disappearance of the subtle feel image talk. That creates the sense that there's anything or person. Extended in time and space. Or in positioned in any location. You have to see the disappearance of the subtle feel image talk that creates that impression and the place where that relative witness disappears too.

It's not an absolute what's the best path who's got the The real answer?

I think the issue is. What works for you at a given time and it might change? Overtime there are People that started out with me doing mindfulness practice and had certain experiences and I recommended that they go to Zen teacher. My teacher Sasaki Roshi. And after doing that practice they decided they wanted to work more within the Zen framework. The traditional zend framework so they transitioned from from Pasadena to them. It can go the other way, too, though I have among my students. People that have long, long decades long. Zen practices that now feel more comfortable working within the mindfulness framework. A number of years ago we had. A meeting at the Spirit Rock Mindfulness Center in California Jack Kornfield's place. Of Western teachers western teachers defined as People teaching in the Western world. And I suspect there was a couple hundred of us there that at that meeting. And. Jack asked us an interesting question, he asked us how many people in this room. Would say that more than one linneage of practice had been significant in their life In other words? How many people in this room had done be possible and virtually honor practice for example, or void Rihanna Anzan practice that kind of thing. And, of those People teaching in the West more than half of them, said that. Very different lineages of practice were significant for them in their development. I find that very interesting in a sense, these sort of. Immediate or perhaps somewhat cavalier answer that I feel like giving as well. The best one is whatever works. It's pragmatic and it may be different at different times for you. One might say. But isn't there. Up a path that is in some way. Absolutely better than others? Is there some way of lining up the paths in terms of well. This will will take you so far, but then you have to do this, then you have to do this some People make claims like that. To be perhaps a little bit blonde. I'll buy it. I don't buy those claims. There is a way to compare Maps and spiritual paths, I believe. But it takes a lot of courage or you need to be able number one and willing number 2. 2. Talk about The strong points. And the weak points. Of whatever path you teach. And that's That's hard, OK, we tend to want to talk about the strong points. But it has been my experience that if you want to compare paths what you compare is strengths and weaknesses. And they tend to have certain strengths and they tend to have certain week weaknesses and to me. That's an honest comparison. For example, I would happily tell you. What I consider to be bad about the way I teach meditation? Maybe that would be another talk but. Well, just briefly. Here's all the things that are bad about how I teach meditation. It's very complex. There's a lot of subtleties you have to remember a lot of technical vocabulary because I'm very picky about words and precision and description. There's a lot of emphasis on. Implementing procedures in a certain way, although it is an algorithm, meaning you're never asked to do anything you can't do. You're not asked to do the impossible, but you're asked to do doable things. But in a very specific way. A lot of People want to be a little more free form about things. I tend to place things in a sort of secular type of language, which may lack some of the. More overtly or explicitly. Spiritual symbols and terminology and so forth so anyway. That's a few of the things that may be bad about the way that I teach you if I thought about it. I could probably come up with some more so anyway. If you want to compare paths. I think you want to say OK. This one is strong. In this way, this way, this way. But it's sort of weak in this way, this way. For example, TM strongpoint anybody could do it right away and have some experience of being a little bit calm, weak point well. You might not take you any further than that. Now I said might not I didn't say it won't. But that might be in fact, the weaknesses are tendencies. They're not absolutes this tends to be strong this way. This tends to be weak. This way as a path so I think if you want to compare things that's the way you compare them. Tendencies. Towards this strength or this weakness, then the other thing that I always like to keep. In mind is that? All of these paths are not very good, the ones that we have now. That have come down to us that anybody has they can be vastly improved upon and as the result of improving upon them. We will see more democratization of enlightenment through over the planet. So it always helps me to keep in mind that. The best path is yet to be discovered if there is indeed a best one and that's exciting and wonderful.","title":"The Best Path"},{"location":"expandcontract/the-big-picture-as-i-see-it/","text":"I started this series of talks defining mindful awareness in terms of 3 components concentration power sensory clarity and equanimity then I talked about how those? 3 components would. Lead to For these 4. Forms of happiness. Ordinary extraordinary happiness for yourself, as sort of the route. And then they also foster ordinary happiness for yourself and they lead you to. Bring both ordinary and extraordinary happiness to others so these are like sort of the four quadrants of the picture of total happiness. And I would claim that you need all 4 quadrants to be a total E happy person. We started with the definition of what mindful awareness is and there were 3 elements needed for that then. We talked about well why do you want it? What good is it and we thought I got these 4 quadrants of total happiness that I mentioned the five things that you need in order to be successful, with mindfulness practice when the concepts get one good technique. Be willing to apply online and regular rhythm updated a practice periodic retreat practice. Day-to-day self practice and then those 4 plus time. Are sort of the factors that lead to mindful elevation? Of the base level of mindful awareness? There is mindfulness practice. Takes a little time to acquire a few concepts acquire one good technique. Then you apply them in the concepts and technique in your life. And you do a regular practice if you can daily practice, I recommend at least 10 minutes a day. Question can be much longer and then periodic retreat practice. I recommend 4 hour. At least a 4 hour mini retreat per month. So. Those 4 things plus time. Not necessarily a lot of time, I'm just saying time itself. Constitutes sort of the practice and so the mindfulness practice elevates the base level of mindful awareness. And that leads to something that I've been calling extraordinary happiness for yourself. A happiness independent of conditions and experience of body and mind. That no longer limits you in identity to the body and mind and external behaviors that improve with time it's an interesting thing. A paradox a A deep mystery. How? The experience of. Going beyond the body mind identity. Which is an experience of dissolving into the source which is an impermanent? Dynamic but vacuous doing. And quite impersonal. How contact with the impersonal how when a human? A human who has feelings and behaviors feelings being pleasant and unpleasant behaviors being good and bad. A human who has feelings and behaviors constant Contacts that which has no feeling. Now pleasant or unpleasant. No good or bad. That as the result of that that human becomes more more deeply nurtured in terms of their fulfillment. And refined in terms of their behaviors that's the central mystery of the Mystical Path. How that happens because it sort of is strange you wouldn't expect it? Why should contact with that which is not good or bad? And isn't human and doesn't have feelings so nurture us at the level of feeling and refine us at the level of skillful and unskillful and our behaviors. It sounds paradoxical. But that's what's happened that's what happens and that's what I'm talking about as extraordinary happiness for yourself. It's also interesting that. Contrary to what you might think. The more you trance end conditions. The. Better it is to improve conditions you might think Well, you transcend conditions. So you become indifferent to conditions. And therefore you know things fall apart, but actually as you become extraordinarily happened happy a happiness. That's beyond this world so to speak, but. Outside of time and space your experience inside in time in space your ordinary happiness for yourself, statistically tends to improve not inevitably. It isn't true for everyone always but as a general principle that is true. And then from this trend sentence. Comes a contact with. The womb. Of consciousness and from that womb is. Where? Self and others arise so there is this concern for the well being of others both that they have ordinary happiness. So that's sort of ordinary service. And also that they have extraordinary happiness as you have begun to experience which is teaching and supporting teaching of this path.

Already, the end is there as soon as the time space volume of that experience is arising it's already passing. And that moles that moment of sensory experience.

Into what I call the five ways. Five ways are 5 contrast, ING approaches to the development of concentration sensory clarity and equanimity. Each of the five ways, is derived from one or several traditions that have existed previously. But what I've done is I've modernized the vocabulary and I have completely illuminated anything that is explicitly religious from it, so that the five ways can be looked upon as a shall we say. Of a way to bring about a secular paradigm for classical enlightenment. The five ways are. Focus in focus out. Focus on rest focus on change and focus on positive. Focus in The end in this case refers to one's innermost experience of thought and emotion. This is derived from the classic discovery of the boat dock. That if you divide the experience of self into its atomic components, the sense of self as thing and the sense of being trapped. In selfish thing disappearance, so there are many ways in the Buddhist literature. For sort of doing this divide and conquer on once I am this, I use one that. Is actually somewhat based on a more front Rihanna POV? But in any event I? Take as the fundamental elements the somatic component of emotional type body sensation. The visual component of mental imagery. Visual thinking In other words, and the auditory component of internal talked or conversations, so I have People tease apart. The sense of E as controller or E as observer or I as experience are at each had a break it down. Into these atoms and then this reduces and eventually eliminates. Self as prison thoughts and emotions as a place. You can't escape from but our constraint, too, so that's the focus in approaches. I say it's essentially based on the one one of the core innovations of the book dot which is this. Untangle and be free paradigm. Focus out is based on the Zen way of working now there's a lot of aspects to them, but one of the aspects is. That, they would have to do their practice as they worked. There was a work ethic in Confucianism that infiltrated into the Zen temples so how are you going to have a deep practice while you're doing physical labor one way to do that is you anchor yourself in the external sites external sounds and physical sensations, so by way of contrast to the field image talk of the subjective world. You could let go of feel image dog let go of the subjective self and. Anchor yourself in the power of now, as exemplified by touch sight S so I call that focus out. That's really useful for practicing life and it was developed as I say as part of the zend curriculum exactly because they were called upon to do so. Much practice in daily life activities. So we got focus in work with the subject of world feeling in stock. You've got focus out by way of contrast work with the object if world. Tight sight sound. Then you have focus on rest, which I've described in some detail in another talk, which is basically my reworking of the whole tranquilizing side of contemplative practice, tranquilizing side of contemplative practice is found all over the world is found in the absorption practices of. Early Buddhism, but it's also found in the contemplative practices of Christianity Islam Judaism. And so forth technically speaking the word contemplation within the Christian context as 2 meetings, is a synonym for meditation. But it's also a special term for deep states of tranquility that they called the prayer of quiet but at its extreme end. They called infused contemplation so I've drawn from the whole worlds. Contemplative traditions and specifically the absorption practices of early Buddhism reformulated that in a completely secular vocabulary. Collet focus on rest and that's sort of the tranquil side of the practice. So that's focusing focus our focus on rest then. Ordinary. Subjective experience field image stock ordinary object of experience touch sight sound and these. More. Uh. Special. Pleasant restful flavors. All of these experiences are experiences. And therefore they are of the nature of empty enerji empty. Enerji doesn't sound very appealing. But it's incredibly empowering an fulfilling once you start to experience them that way. I teach People how to notice how any and all sensory experience changes and also along with that to be aware of the underlying forces that are responsible for that change well by observing change. Both continuous change in the sense of flowing energean. Discontinuous change in the sense of vanishings that gets us in contact with the energycap aspect. And the Emptiness. Which is the essence of that enerji so that whole approach to things which involves impermanence and? What the Christians called Ken Gnosis the emptying out? Into the source I call that focus on change, so that's 4th way, and that will tend to deconstruct the something Ness of self. And the material ality of the external world into a kind of transparent enerji so you could call that kind of. Dying into the source. Right if you die you have to be reborn and the whole idea and being reborn is to be reported better not just to be reborn. So then there's something called focus on positive where you actively generate positive content in mental image internal talk emotional feel, and that. Creates a new self that new self arises from the nothingness as a better something us. And let's focus on positive and so that taken together, gives a very complete toolkit for classical enlightenment.","title":"The Five Ways - A Contemporary Toolkit for Classical Enlightenment"},{"location":"expandcontract/the-focus-on-positive-theme/","text":"Instead of just observing the subjective system of feel image dog. We've been intentionally finding a creating holding and even radiating what I call positive states so. Sometimes in the process of just observing it might happen to you, that you get a mental picture that has a deep positive significance for you, it might happen. Native People value this very much and actually go through various physical ordeals of fasting and other ceremonies in order to get those deep sort of directional images and anthropologists. Call it a vision quest. Although native People just call it fasting if it Indian says I've been fasting they probably mean just spent. 4 days without any food or any water alone on a Hill. Crying for a vision. So it could happen as you're. Just in the course of practice that a particularly powerful image comes up. Or you could intentionally create it. Uh so if it comes up spontaneously you can just note it if you're doing focus in and not treated in any way special or you can decide Hey. This is significant. I'm going to try to hold it intentionally. Go with it and that becomes a focus on a positive image analogously it could happen just spontaneously that a wisdom. Word or phrase something that encapsulates a certain good direction. Psychologically behaviourally or spiritually for you, some something comes up in the talk space. And you might want to just observe it or you might want to hold on to it. So then you could shift to a focus on positive but it's also possible to intentionally create those kinds of words phrases and sentences if you wish. Positive feel is. A special case, I would say of. Of feel in general and its field that typically is pleasant, although you can have compassion type fields that are sort of sad. But in a compassionate way, etc. Quite how one would classify that I'm not sure. But usually the positive fields are pleasant their associated with a positive direction in your behavior or positive aspiration aspiration's for others. But I also count positive field as pleasant sensations associated with being an highly concentrated states. Pleasant sensations associated with the presence of flow. Restful states or just an intrinsic joy for no reason whatsoever. I hate to Canada in Sanskrit, miss joy. That's just our birthright and it doesn't have to have a reason. This would be a range of things that we could call positive feel, and they could come up once again spontaneously in our as we're just observing things or we can sort of look for it created attempt to hold it and when you look for it. When you decide to hold it if it's come up spontaneously or you intentionally look for it create it. And then hold it that's an approach called focus on positive. When you have things that fall under the category of positive come up spontaneously. Then you sort of have a choice whether to deal with the matter of Factly. Weather to go for a focus on positive, which is sort of a formal structure where you hold repeat and so forth or whether to go into just discursive thinking. An like OK, I'm going to explore this and think about this in the normal way that I think about things because this seems like nature is opening an insight door or some window and I would like to pursue it discursively so essentially if something unusually positive comes up visually Auditoria Lee. Or Somatically in the subject of domain as you're practicing I would say you have 3 choices and sorry to give you so many choices. But they're all good. The basic thing about not being freaked out by choices is to realize. All the choices are good you're not going to miss out, no matter which one you take so one choices. You're just going to deconstruct it. There's famous story about. You know the Zen Monk is meditating and the gods are so impressed by his practice that they come and like give Flowers everyday you know this goes on for a couple weeks and. Finally, one day just. Takes out the case Aqua beats the crap out all the gods and get the hell outta here OK well. It's it's a metaphor OK for being matter of fact no matter what comes up even if the gods give you Flowers and Bayview and whatever seemingly that's just feel image talk so even if you know very impactful think things come up you might decide to simply that's just feel image dog. That's one decision and then you would be penetrating them. But in the same way that you would penetrate any sensory them. Alternatively, OK. Let's go to hold positive. It's a formal technique. I'm going to repeat that talk as a mantra, I'm going to try to maintain that image. I'm going to try to maintain that feel or some combination of those, 3, you know a pair or all 3 at once. So then you go to focus on positive 3rd possibility Oh. Nature seems to be presenting me with an insight window here. I need to think about this and you start thinking you notice that I go nowhere without a notepad. When? Insights come. I will often go into discursive thought. And I will write things down, etc, etc. Now I know I'm suspending the formal practice in order to think. In the normal way because I have to think in the normal way to pursue that insight and it is certainly OK to do that on occasion? What we want to avoid is. A meditation that is only discursive thought because that's not really meditation, but it's certainly OK to do that when it seems appropriate. id: the-focus-on-positive-theme title: The Focus on Positive Theme hide_title: false sidebar_label: The Focus on Positive Theme A final theme is to intentionally create hold and radiate positive states in feel image talk. You'll remember I describe feel image talk as the course objective system that's the world of thought and emotion. We have internal control over it to a certain extent, particularly talk, we can decide to. Create a certain talk an repeated over and over again, essentially that's a mantra practice. But it's also a cognitive therapy practice. You can if you have irrational going on irrational cognitions that our word based you can selectively attend to the antidote to that which would be a more rational cognition. And in cognitive behavioral therapy that's what they have People do well. I would say that that person is intentionally, creating and holding positive talk positive in the sense of rational as opposed to irrational or appropriate as opposed to inappropriate we can also hold positive images. Once again, they can be either more rational images or they can be images of behavior changes or performance. Improvements that we would like to make or images of outcomes that we would like to see happen or images of symbols archetypes that represent spiritual goals for us or just images of People places objects that make us feel good that activate pleasant emotional feel that would be an antidote to uncomfortable emotions depression fear and so forth. It's pretty easy for most People to intentionally create a positive dimension in talk and hold that little harder for image. But doable by many People feel is even harder, but it's doable. You can actually learn in a systematic way to turn on positive feel by that. I mean, pleasant feel that would be interest. Joy love gratitude, those kinds of things. Compassion. Intentionally creating holding an radiating positive states in one. Or, a pear or all three of the fit system. I call that approach focus on positive.","title":"The 'Focus on Positive' Theme"},{"location":"expandcontract/the-happy-wanderer-har-prakash-khalsa/","text":"OK, maybe we have time for one or more other questions.

Positive focus and then they can stay with that play with it or not they can go back to their technique. And so anyways, it's just become like another. Window of opportunity for them. That's cool and that involves. Detecting the Pleasant interest flavor, absolutely, yeah, that's that's pivotal. Yeah, the 3 hours my theory of what drives human attention for 3 hours. Tear cheer fear other words, sadness interest and fear. I find are the basic flavors that control where our attention those and whereas at the beginning, the wandering mine is a source of suffering they can reframe it so that the wandering mind becomes turns into freedom from suffering that's really clever could I use that. It can also be used. If you're If you're working with the do nothing technique. And what often of course, prevents People from. Having to do nothing technique be a quote. Could experience experience? So there's a way to do the do. Nothing technique where you alternate between the do. Nothing technique and the making wandering mine into a positive focus anything kind of. Play with that go ahead and use that too. So we need a we need a a quick term for this thing that you're doing with the wandering mind. I think I think I've come up with the name of the technique. We'll call it the Happy Wanderer.","title":"The Happy Wanderer & Har-Prakash Khalsa"},{"location":"expandcontract/the-hockey-stick-metaphor-and-exponential-growth-on-the-spiritual-path/","text":"Not true for everyone, but often a persons are growth on the path of liberation will follow. What is colloquially called a hockey stick curve the proper name for this is an exponential curve? An exponential curves have the characteristic that the more you grow the faster you grow snowball is an example of an exponential curve. The growth rate of the snowball is proportional to the surface area of the snowball so the bigger the snowball gets the faster the snowball. Add snow so the rate of growth is proportional to how much it has grown and if you have any background. In calculus or analysis, you know the math behind this, it's quite fundamental actually in those fields so in any event. So when you start your practice you do if you follow this common pattern. You do grow OK but it seems like you're growing linear. Um and it's not it's there's growth there, OK, but it's not stunning. It's sort of like well at this rate. It's going to really, really take a long time to get anywhere. But hopefully you persevere OK. And at some point. You start to notice it's like really taking off. And some People call this the break point in the curve. As I say it is by no means the case that everyone that follows the spiritual path goes through that this kind of situation. But an awful lot of People do now. Of course, the natural question is at what point does. This dramatic upsurge take place and we can't say exactly for some People. It happens fairly early on in their practice for other People. It might take. In the most extreme case, maybe 10 or 15 years. What? Happens at this point that makes the difference well. There can be a lot of factors. But one of them is certainly. When one reaches the point where one starts to get what I called the flavor of purification. In other words, you start to actually. Detect have a tangible experience that when you bring mindful awareness, to an unpleasant experience your purifying consciousness. You can actually taste the purification happening within within you. That, it's a kind of really hard to put into words. But it's A kind of knowing that because of the way. I'm experiencing this moment every moment of my future is going to have more fulfillment and less suffering. Another way to put it is it's an attachable awareness that because of the way I'm experiencing this moment. I'm clearing up the stored poison of the pain and pain from all my purse. Previous moments, you actually since that happening once that taste is there. You've got a positive feedback loop going and what characterizes hockey stick growth is a positive feedback loop. In other words, the bigger gets the faster grows so once there's the positive feedback that bringing equanimity. Concentration clarity, but especially equanimity to a present experience that you can actually taste. It building a better future for you and cleaning out the past for you. Once that happens now. You've got a positive feedback loop and that's one of the. Causes of this dramatic runaway growth. There can be other causes also so I give People this hockey stick metaphor by way of encouragement when they're in this seeming linear phase here and it just doesn't seem like anything, it seems like yeah, growth is happening. But it's the journey is 1,000,000 miles and in the first year I go 10 miles. It's you know that doesn't bode well. But what People don't realize is that well. Maybe in the next year. You'll go 100 and the next year, you go 1000 etc. Etc and at some point, it becomes evident to you. You reach these sort of Oh my God place. Right about here where you realize that little old me. Can fees obli? Hope to experience the classic results that I've read about in. These ancient books.","title":"The Hockey Stick Metaphor and Exponential Growth on the Spiritual Path"},{"location":"expandcontract/the-native-american-sweat-lodge-ceremony-part-1-of-2/","text":"So I'm wearing this. Rather. Striking shirt. That was given to be by a Cree Medison man friend of mine Vern Harper, who I've known for many years. He's a rather well known spiritual leader among the creep people in the Toronto area. I'm up in Canada. Now, running a retreated Niagara Falls and I'll be seeing him in just a week when the retreats over. Because we offer. As a feature of our retreats here in Canada, the opportunity for our retreat and Stew participate in traditional Native American Sweat Lodge ceremony. It's not a required piece of the retreat. But if they want to stay on after the retreat ends. We go to some property that he owns and he does a sweat lodge for us, the same thing happens? When I run retreats in Arizona? I have a Todd not autumn, Medison man named Rupert and Sinas, who I've known for 27 years. He does the same thing for my retreats in Tucson, AZ fact? I just saw Rupert just one week ago, I just completed running a retreat in Arizona and indeed we had sweat lodge ceremony there too. It was with Rupert. In Arizona that I had my first experience of the Native American Sweat Lodge, which pretty much convinced me that this is something for me. I would say that the sweat. Lodge ceremony, which the Lakota people. Call me PINIPI literally in their language, meaning a tool for life. I would say that the Sweat Lodge ceremony is the representative, spiritual practice of the Americas. It's done all the way from Canada down into Mexico. If not further into S America. I don't know about. The southernmost part of the Americas, but it certainly for Mexico and North America, absolutely representative. In fact, in Los Angeles, where I come from. There is a Canyon in Southern California called Temescal Canyon, which is from the. Mexican Spanish tennis call Temis Cal is the Spanish word at least in Latin America for the Sweat Lodge. It's an Aztec word from the Aztec Thomas collie, meaning hothouse literally. How I got involved in this was that 27 years ago I was running retreats in Arizona? And I was using the ranch of a man named Doug Boyd, who has written some books about Native American spiritual leaders. Doug had this idea that Buddhist leaders should be getting together with Native American leaders. So he said. After your retreat, if you want I can have a local Indian. I can have local Medison man run a sweat lodge for your retreatants. I didn't know what a sweat. Lodge was I said, well what is it he described it to me. It's in some ways like a like a sauna in that there's a hot rocks and water is poured but whereas the sauna is secular event. The Sweat Lodge is a deeply transformative spiritual event with prayers songs and a kind of shared enerji so explain to me. The Sweat Lodge and the mechanics of it and it sounded interesting. And he said, You're very fortunate. I know this local spiritual leader here in Arizona Rupert and seen us. Up and he is a veteran sundancer. In addition to being a sweat. Lodge leader I said, what's a Sundance and he described to me, this almost inconceivable shamanic ordeal of that Plains Indians? Do called the Sundance and he said rope. It is done. This many years actually at this point group. It's done at 18 years on 18 Sundance is. Each one of which involves 4 days in the blazing sun without food or liquid and with pierces through you that have to be torn out, according to the Lakota tribe anyway. You have to do 4 years of sun dancing before you're qualified to lead a sweat lodge. So I say Rupert is not an 18 years, which is by the way. The difference between doing sweat lodges with native People and doing sweat lodges with incompetent non native People. There's absolutely no danger whatsoever in I've been sweating for 27 years. Starting with Rupert and I've never, ever heard of any even minor physical problems developing. As the result of a traditional sweat run by competent. Lee trade native People, but you see the kind of training. You have to go through before they'll give you the responsibility of running a sweat lodge is pretty amazing. So. Doug described the Sweat Lodge. He described Rupert described Rupert's qualifications and it sounded interesting. It seemed to make sense to me, so we had our vipasana retreat and then Rupert came over and they had a sweat. Lodge it dogs. Rauch the physical structure sort of Dome shaped and it's got a A dug out area in the middle where the grandfathers grandfathers are the hot rocks. There looked upon as the oldest People on the planet. There addressed as People when they're brought in their sort of given their taken back to their original condition of being hot, the way they were at the beginning of the Earth. There heated in a fire then their broad and this water is poured on them that gives off an intense. Steam that is called the breath of the grandfathers and so these ancient ancient ones breathe on you and that purify's you physically and Psycho spiritually that sort of the model have a lookup on it. We took the group into the lodge and. Ah, he did, he did that ceremony and I remember? Coming out of the lodge. The first thought that occured to me. In talk space was this joking thought OK. This irony thought. Uh. Oh, so this is what they call primitive religion. Because I can remember when I was young, reading about the religion of tribal peoples under the title primitive religion. So it's like and I saw that would primitive in quotes and. The joke was that. It was one of the most sophisticated and subtle an advanced spiritual modalities. I'd ever encountered.","title":"The Native American Sweat Lodge Ceremony - Part 1 of 2"},{"location":"expandcontract/the-native-american-sweat-lodge-part-2-of-2/","text":"Yes, a stone axes in some sense more primitive than steel. Axe so I guess the assumption among the Europeans when they came to the Americas was well their axes are more primitive than ours. Therefore, their consciousness must be more primitive in ours. Once you've participated in their ceremony. You don't know whether to laugh or cry at that motion. Because it is so deep and so subtle on the surface. It's a prayer ceremony. It's also a physical cleansing. It's also a shared groups sort of Group Therapy 'cause People talk and their defenses are down. It is a shamanic journey into the power realms because of the altered states that you may enter at a deeper level. It is purification of consciousness through having equanimity with strong sensations. Both physical and emotional sensations. Come up and within the context of the ceremony ceremony induces a mindful state. And therefore consciousness is purified purification equals. Sensation multiplied by equanimity fits in my model perfectly. So that's a very deep level and at the deepest level. It's experience of the flow of nature in terms of the fundamental forces of expansion and contraction. They may use different words. They use father Sky Mother Earth. Or they talk about the bowl of the pipe versus the stem of the pipe the Earth versus. The tree but everything is built on an interplay of flow of affirmation and negation. I've even heard native People. Talk about yin and Yang actually use those words in the ceremonies because of their education. You know that they've learned of concepts from E Asia and so forth and see how they map on in fact, the word me pee in the Lakota language. I said it means a tool for life. But the stem knee in Lakota Lakota. If you're not familiar with the term is the Western Sioux. Need means life, but it also means breath. And it also means the sort of. Flowing enerji of spirit that would be vibrating expanding contracting and so forth so it's the whole ceremony is built around merging with the fundamental flow of the expensive Sky and the contract if Earth and the vibrating enerji that's born in between them so it's like. It's the essence of mindfulness practice as I understand it. And on Top of that it's fun. It's It's colorful it's shared with a group Buddhist practices, so well. I mean, there's the subtle sharing that happens on a silent retreat. But it's sort of like silent, with yourself. This is not a subtle sharing your singing they're like really singing and People are crying and People are saying things because their defenses are down and then everybody is affirming them, they're saying that's good, yeah that brother. Good you know it's like this. Shared support structure that you have it's very communal so it makes the perfect complement to the Buddhist practice. the Buddhist practice gives you systematic techniques for doing things they don't have those systematic techniques because they don't need those systematic techniques. They just do these ceremonies. They don't have the concepts of purification equals plane plus equanimity multiplied by clarity etc. They just do the ceremonies, OK, they don't need the terminology. They don't have to have a philosophical system about the fundamental Oneness of things. They just say all my relations and that sums it all up OK. We're all related. It's like Oh, so this is what they mean by primitive religion, OK In other words, this so called primitive religion is really subtle multilayered. Goes down to the deepest you know from the most surface to the deepest. In a single integrated ceremony it's like. So impressive as a spiritual vehicle so I knew this is for me. It was 27 years ago and it's been true. I've been doing. These ceremonies with native People. Wherever I can wherever I run a retreat and there is someone that can do it in the traditional way. I make it available for our retreat and's my metaphor is that for me the Buddhist practice will always be the cake sort of the substance, but I like a little frosting on my cake and the date of American ceremonies. In general, specifically the Sweat Lodge. Represents that frosting on the cake for me.","title":"The Native American Sweat Lodge - Part 2 of 2"},{"location":"expandcontract/the-one-true-love-of-touch-sight-sound/","text":"Year but wall-e herbal shirt.

The Dallas notion. Of Oneness. The Oneness of the Dow, the one the Oneness of inside and outside the Oneness of humans with nature. So you bring in the boot I never talked about Oneness. The Buddha talked about freedom from suffering freedom from limited existence never talked about Oneness, but one this is certainly a facet. Of. Of the practice Taoism talked about that a lot, so. How does that come together well? If you were to do Zen with my teacher, Joshu Sasaki Roshi. One of the first koans or questions, he give you is when you see the flower. How do you become free? How do you experience one true love? When you hear the temple Bell? How do you experience one true love? When you Chop vegetables. How do you experience one true love notice these are touch sight sound? Things. So while you're working what do you need to work you need touches sights sounds?

The. Surface of the subconscious. Can be reached through mental talk? A little deeper level. Cannot be reached. By mental talk, but it can be reached by mental images. The deepest level of the subconscious cannot even be reached by mental images, but it can be reached by body sensations. The way mindfulness deals with the subconscious. Is? By setting up a feedback loop. Which I've described in other segments? Whereby? At the level of body sensations. When the reptilian brain which is essentially a body brain a touch feel brain. When the reptilian brain notices that when it interferes with the flow of body sensation its own product. Of course, that there is suffering. And when it stops interfering that there is the absence of suffering or fulfillment. The reptilian brain notices that. And it is changed in the classical skinneri, Skinneri and mode. You train the animal the way you train, an animal with reward and punishment at the level of body sensation. So by putting yourself in in an environment where not much is going on for a period of time, either the micro retreat of that daily sit or the macro retreat of? Taking a weekend or a week or 10 days or longer, and going off and doing nothing but meditation within that simplified environment. The deepest mine can unlearn it's habit of fighting with itself. Essentia Lee What BF Skinner and the others in the Behavioralist School proved was that if you want to train an animal that animal has to. Be given rewards and punishments and those rewards and punishments have to. B. Immediate appan the behavior and they have to be absolutely predictable. If they're not if their random. Then you won't get strong. Learning. And if there's a gap between the behavior and the. Reinforcing stimulus. Then also there won't be strong learning. So, in the simplified environment of us, it or a retreat a situation is setup where the animal within us, the reptilian brain. Can consistently and immediately? Be aware when it fights with itself. There is suffering so that's the punishment when it stops fighting with itself. There is fulfillment that's the reward. The simplified environment of formal practice creates the situation where there is consistent and immediate. Reinforcing feedback. In the classical skin, Arian Mode. I know Skinner is sort of a dirty word in a sense because the behavioral is. Influence at a certain period in the academic world lead to ridiculous notions about the nature of. Of humanity, however, they did have some good points, going for them and it turns out somewhat. Ironically, I think that. The most subtle and powerful spiritual path that I'm aware of something that the skin. Ariens would have been horrified by which is the Buddhist experience. Turns out that. Large parts of it are best explained by skin. Arian model, but in this case. The behavior is not that the lizard is being trained to or the mouse is being trained to press a bar or turn this way or that way, and amaze the lizard level of the human. Is being trained as a lizard? Is trained but by a human? Who has intentionally set up that situation for themselves? To train their lizard brain the lizard brain is being trained into something incredibly subtle. The new behavior is. Not interfering with its own activity. Which is? To say that it's being trained into equanimity. The result. And this is where the skin. Ariens would freak which is sort of poetic justice. The result of that skinnerian conditioning of the lizard brain is that ordinary experience becomes utterly spiritualized, and becomes. Indeed, a direct contact with one spiritual self or one spiritual source. So that where is the skin skin Ariens would have in their extreme form denied that there even is a thing called subjective experience. It turns out that their model can be used to explain the deepest of all subjective experiences, which some People would say is the experience of.

My Yana evolved in of a driana the religious stuff was really intense. So now the Buddha is a deity. And to be come up with that means to be comma, deoti so how is that feasible. Well, what they did is they did something very, very clever. They. Showed People how they could become ADATA God, it's called deity yoga. Yoga in the sense of merging by the way. Plane and you're in the Tibetan language. Now you've probably heard that. Tibetan Buddhism is secret Buddhism, there these secret initiations. So now I'm going to give away the secret to all of you. Yes, that's right here's the secret of secret Buddhism. How do you become a deity? In a way that is not insanity or possession. By the way. How do you become a deity in a way that brings about the same incited liberation as the deconstructive process of early Buddhism. Very clever. Here's how you do it. You replace your internal talk with the mantra of the deity. You replace yourself image. With the image of a deal. And you replace your normal human feelings with the feel of the deity and you form the touch of the deity by making. Hand gestures mood dress, so touch feel image talk. Of a myth. You become the myth. As I say Not to be insane. And not to be possessed, but to gain insight into Watt. Insight into the arbitrary nature of self identification because you created this alternate identity from scratch. And you know. It's a map. Yet you becoming very clever. It was a way of meeting the People where they were at they were worshipping these archetypes. Buddhism had really moved from its early sort of good as a spiritual scientists just another guy, but an extraordinary guy too. OK, but as an archetype so now. So now become the archetype and you'll get the same insight into how the sense of self arises so once again. We're working with feel image talk aren't we? Broadly. It's another way to do focus on positive. As I defined focus on positive. So, in Tibetan Buddhism, they in the core of these if you look at the surface. It looks like they're doing. These rituals, but inside there doing DD, yoga, where there be coming. This deity than becoming this other day, then becoming this other deity. In order to see that. When you work with those elements. Those are the elements that create the illusion of self if it can create the illusion of a mythical self. Then it certainly can create the illusion of your ordinary self and you gain the same insights. So one of the reasons that I define focus on positive so broadly is to allow some students. Who wish to todo deity yoga? Some of my students that relate to that I would never encourage a person to do this. But some of them want to do it and it could be very insightful well. The focus on positive technique that I give you is so broadly defined that it includes within it. Not only early Buddhist loving kindness. But DD yoga, 'cause you're working with those elements in a very systematic way. Lot of times Westerners if they want to do this will not choose the deities of India and Tibet. They'll choose Western archetypes that certainly my case when I do this. I typically use love your hand like Wanna, Lupe, Virgin of Guadalupe 'cause I grew up seeing that in LA. And that's like you know that's a very it's very natural for me. So I use of Emory's yeah, so you got the little Jewish boy from LA does the Catholic Tantric practice? Well, that's the world we live in. But it works, you can do with any archetype. And in fact. Traditional way that you're supposed to be taught to do. The Rosary is you visualize the mystery. You have the certain prayer and talk space and you're supposed to experience emotions and your touch wise engaged with the rosary. It's the same elements OK.

That we could be aware of change and the forces and enerji that produce change. And I called that aspect that theme. The dynamic aspect of experience if the change has the form of. An abrupt diminishing then I call that a vanishing even if it doesn't completely vanish. And all the other aspects of change. I call flow. Now there's lots of different flavors of flow flow can be sort of like bubbly or it could be WAVY. And so forth. But in the formulation that I like to use behind all the different flavors of flow are 2 oppositely directed. Flavors of flow that will refer to abstractly as expansion and contraction. Sasaki Roshi has a list of several dozen synonyms for this contrast, an many of the synonyms are confusing don't seem to have anything to do with the other synonyms sort of weird People out. But what he's trying to do is point out that many things that superficially appear to be unrelated. In fact at a deep level. Reflect these 2 sides of nature. He'll sometimes call them put us process with minus can you understand for us who? For us Minusu. Yes told means and so plus it'll minus. Interesting Lee very, very seldom will he ever say. Are. Yo to yen in Toyota OK in is Jen OK and you always young right, although clearly these are related to the Dallas. The yen and Yang very seldom does. He say in your prefers to use the English minus. But behind it is obviously the Dallas background of E Asian thought. Mixed with the Indic element of the notion that there's a cancellation of yen. And Yang called 0 expansion is the principle of increase contraction is the principle of decrease expansion is the principle of outward movement outward force. Contraction is the principle of inward movement inward force. So that means that as you're paying attention to sensory experience. If anything increases that's expansion so expansion isn't this mysterious thing that someday if you finally grow up. You'll be able to experience. If you have a pain and it's getting bigger that's expansion. If you're listening to a sound and it's getting smaller and smaller and smaller as the airplane goes away. That's contraction. Don't tell me you never experienced expansion or contraction any increase any decrease. Represents these underlying principles. So what can increase well intensity level can increase. Of what anything but talk in your head pain in your body hot cold. Light so expansion right contraction. No more mysterious than that. One thing that can increase and decrease is intensity level. What else could increase in decrease well vibrations can speed up and slow down. The talk in your head can get louder and softer, but could also get faster or slower. The spiking pain in your knee can spike at a certain level that it could speed up a whole lot. Then it could slow down a little bit so the sort of frequency of something can increase or decrease. In your body you may be aware of. Pressures if you take any pressure. You can analyze it ask yourself is it outward inward or both at the same time frequently. It's both at the same time, and frequently their clashing producing a sense of discomfort, but that's OK. That's those are still forces expansion contraction forces. Have you notice that your mind could be scattered in many directions. And I can obsess on one thing. That could be looked upon as a problem or that can simply be looked upon as a manifestation of expansion and contraction. And not a problem, just part of the flow of nature. If the attention is scattered. In many directions at once. And you're focused on the fact that it's scattered. Then you have high concentration on expansion. And yes, you let that happen with this technique. An and you give up the need to have order. And you just let yourself be sort of. Always at once kind of thing, but there is concentration and clarity or clear that you're scattered and you're focused on. How your your blown in all directions at once so yes with this technique let that happen and if you can't get off something and it's like you're like nailed to it. You can parse that as the contract if force an not fight with it. Most importantly, The spatial scope of a sensory phenomenon can increase or decrease. As I have set up these categories touch sight sound feel image talk every one of them has depth with an height. Now the depth width and height might not be well defined might be sort of cloud like a nebulous but there is. A right left measure there's a front back measures up down measure roughly for any of the spaces. Even the mind has a front and a back visual part that tends to appear in front and an auditory part, that tends to be more posterior relative to that talk space. Not very well defined spatially, but image space. You got the images in the center of image space. The images around you images of your own body. At space, the space occupied by a sensor event. May increase or decrease usually? It does one of the other very seldom do all 3 dimensions of a sensory volume remained completely fixed. So if it gets a little wider expansion if it gets a little narrower contraction. If it gets a little larger in the front back. Demension deeper depth increases expansion depth decreases contraction lengthens expansion. Shortens contraction. Uh. Lengthens and at the same time pause in to the sides and in the front and back. Both. My balls, OK, it's expanding and Wonder Demension, attracting along the other if you take. Spaghetti dough OK or something and you pull it. It will expand. An contract at the same time. Any change in spatial volume along 1, two or all three of the axes. Counts as expansion and contraction for anything touch sight sound field image talk or the corresponding restful states for that matter. The increase in decrease in intensities. And the increase in decrease in frequencies and the inwards an outward pressures in the body and the scattering and grouping forces in the mind. In the end all present themselves if you look carefully. As stretching zan squeak and or squeezings of the spatial volume. Of experience a spatial volume of sensory experience if you have a pain. You know how you can measure it is with depth site take that altogether. That's it's spatial volume so. Things's quenching along one dimension, they push pull out along another mentioned and sometimes the whole spatial volume can increase the whole spatial volume could decrease all all three axes, it wants spreading collapsing. When you become very sensitive to the moment of arising. Of a sensor event, you see that as that sensor event transitions from not existence into existence. It occupies it creates a volume of space. And. When that sensor event disappears completely that volume of Space disappears that it occupies. If you Totale 100%. Affirm a sensory event at the moment of arising. If if you're just like instantly with it and instantly giving the big yes. Then. You'll see that as soon as it's arising it's already passing already passing. It's arising in its in its beginning as it send OK as TS Eliot set as its arising it's already passing that means there's a simultaneous growth. Of spatial volume and a shrinkage of spatial volume right right behind that in time so that it's both moving out and in at the same time. I just give this to you as a heads up. There is nothing in the world that you can do to make that experience available but. Just you now have a vocabulary in the language in just in case you should ever notice that as soon as something is arising. It's also passing temporally. Its space is expanding and spaces contracting right behind that at the same time, producing a bidirectional flux. At a local level. That will often take the form of. By flow and then a complete disappearance of banishing so both gone both got both gone. At a local level. That sums at a global level to the to an experience of. Everything is signed up is simultaneously born in between expanding contracting spirit flow and that expanding contracting spirit. Flow is peppered with trillions of vanishings that give it a profound tranquility at the same time. So it got literally goes everywhere. Everywhere meaning as far out as out and as far in as in can be and goes nowhere at exactly the same time. That's the theme of expensive contractive flow. Thousands of thousands of human beings over the centuries have become completely enlightened without ever once using the word expansion and contraction. So. Don't make a big deal out of this, it's just a theme that can be explored.","title":"The Theme of Expansive and Contractive Flow"},{"location":"expandcontract/the-three-dimensional-shape-of-simultaneous-expansion-and-contraction/","text":"If we want to say that you're looking for a shape the shape you're looking for is concentric spheres, spreading out and concentric spheres coming back.

At the at the same time, and it's doing that this way, this way, this way that way that way and that way. So it's like a 3 dimensional fountain that gushes from the center and gathers to the center. If I had to give a shape to it. It is intriguing. To look at the large scale anatomy of the human brain. I'm not sure that. This has anything to do with what I'm describing at all. But there is a there is a general pattern to what your brain does. Sensory. Sensory input goes, it, I'm grossly oversimplified, but to a great oversimplification sensory input goes up the back of your spinal cord. Into something called the Corona Radiata. That sort of looks like this is right in the center of your brain and that means the radiating Crown OK. And then it goes from there is processed in the Cortex. And then the sense in the sensory cortex, then it moves over the surface of the brain to the motor. Cortex and then the motor. Cortex sends messages down. Once again down through the Corona Radiata and down the front of the spinal column and control spinal cord controls the body roughly speaking, so roughly speaking, you have movement up and down the spinal cord simultaneously. And from the center of the brain out and then from the periphery of the brain in you have the sensory. Input and the motor output and whether this fountain that I'm describing has anything to do with that or not I don't know. But if you look at a picture of it. It sure looks like a picture of what I just. Of Uh, a gushing and gathering simultaneously.","title":"The Three-Dimensional 'Shape' of Simultaneous Expansion and Contraction"},{"location":"expandcontract/the-trickle-down-paradigm-of-transformation/","text":"Sometimes, while you're practicing meditation or as the result of practicing meditation. You remember things from the past. That you completely forgot. And sometimes those are emotionally charged so when they come up. In the present you greet them with equanimity and there's a sense of what in therapy is called Catharsis or releasing? You've heard of economizing well let's start talking about the quantum ising, economizing means bringing equanimity, which is non self interference. To a sensory event, so something may percolate up from your biography. You greet it with equanimity. UE quantum eyes, it and you get a sense that it's being released. This is sort of in the classic sense in the classic mode of psychotherapy specific biographical material has been uncovered. And has been. Accepted an integrated and that's catharsis. However. I would say that the bulk of the Catharsis. The bulk of the integration. The bulk of the purification in the depths of our consciousness that comes about through. Mindfulness practice. Does not take the classic form of specific? Memories or other material percolating up. Most of it happens without us knowing that it's happening. The classic example in my case. Is I did a reach attend a retreat in the Uber Kim tradition? Which involves sweeping the awareness through the body not halfway through the retreat I? Notice that there was a little bit of congestion in my lung area and so forth nothing. All that big a deal just some slight discomfort and I remember briefly thinking Oh that must be the effect of all the smoke that I put in my lungs from the last 10 years of smoking marijuana every day. There was no thought of Oh my God. I've hurt my lungs **** I should stop smoking marijuana nothing like that at all just. Just this awareness and then you know the retreat went on. But when I got back. I. Update past I didn't smoke any grass another day passed. I didn't smoke any grass. Finally, many days passed and I realized I just wasn't going to do it anymore. And there was no conscious decision. There was no weighing of cause and effect. There was no on the wagon off the wagon. There was no struggle there is no nothing. The part of my body that was. Enjoying getting high and the part of my body that was not enjoying being damaged. Apparently were allowed to talk to each other without my knowing it. And come to a conclusion that radically effortlessly unexpectedly. Changed a deep seated behavior pattern. So. Something happened, and the subconscious rewired itself. Sometimes. There can be changes that you don't even get a hint of at least I had a hint in this case, but lot of times. You do a retreat and mostly what you're aware of at the retreat is physically uncomfortable you can't concentrate. Are in emotional turmoil you're judging yourself, you're judging others and all that goes away only because you get sleepy. And that's mostly what your experience was. But then you leave the retreat. And you discover that. Something in your fundamental alienation separation from inside and outside is gone forever. Neighbors been blasting the stereo. Half the day. You realize it used to drive you crazy and it doesn't and it's not going to changes take place. While you were doing the practice. You might not have had any hint at all. That anything productive was going on. It's just you were uncomfortable your mind was wandering. But. In that environment. You created a situation where those circuits could communicate with each other. And rewire themselves. I make the claim that the bulk of the. Transformation of the subconscious or depths of our being. Typically takes place unconsciously. I call it the trickle down paradigm for working with the subconscious we shine. The flashlight of mindfulness on the surface of sensory experience and a certain number of photons go down to the very bottom of the Lake. And give The circuits down there what they need to rewire themselves with the surface. Either knowing very little or often knowing nothing. Of the rewiring process now a person might well challenge. This point of view, saying well. How do you know that's happening you're saying something happens, but we're not consciously aware of it? Any you know, I can say there are pink Kangaroos in this room, but only I can see them. Could you disprove that well it's non falsifiable so it's a meaningless statement so person might say? Well, that the subconscious rewires itself when you're doing meditation is a meaningless statement because. How do you know that's happening if you're not aware of it well you're not aware of it at the time you don't know what's going on necessarily but you are aware of significant permanent positive changes in perception and behavior after you have left the retreat. And therefore you can hypothesize that something like this is going on. We can't see electromagnetic fields. But we look at behavior on the surface and we hypothesize OK, something like the Maxwell Field equations describe what's going on even though we don't see it. We can hypothesize that from the effect so we can hypothesize reasonably I would claim. From the changes in perception and behavior that People experience. From the retreat environment. That something like this rewiring is occurring.","title":"The Trickle-Down Paradigm of Transformation"},{"location":"expandcontract/the-true-beauty-of-your-soul/","text":"I will sometimes use the words soul. When I do. I am referring to. Essentia Lee ones subjective world. The world of feel image and talk. Considered in terms of its? Deepest layers. In other words. When you Work with your subjective experience of practice that I call focus in. You can track the surface of your subjective experience in terms of explicit mental pictures, which tend to center in front of or behind your eyes internal talk, which tends to center in your ears. Or in your head somewhere, maybe symmetrical, maybe asymmetrical and then emotional type body sensations. So the emotional type body sensations. If their present. I say that they feel is active so you have feel image talk. So you can track your subjective world of thought. Emotion reaction desire and so forth will in terms of on the surface. Feel image talk. As the surface feel image talk sort of plays itself out you become aware that underneath. That explicit feel image talk are subtler and subtler and subtler levels of. Similar stuff but it's finer and more widespread. So there's Layers of subtle image activity underneath the surface image activity. Likewise, with talk likewise with feel. In fact, even when there doesn't seem to be any explicit talk going on, you can sort of hear rumbling in subtle activity and talk space. Same with sort of like snow on your mental screen a rumbling deep down an image space. And in your emotional centers in your body it's like the circuits. There are idling like the wheels are turning but. The clutch is not engaged so you're not emotionally going anywhere, so there are these subtle levels of Association and processing that are fine, but broad. I will sometimes loosely in a sort of colloquial way refer to those more subtle deep levels of feel image talk activity as soul. For example, when you get a sense that material is being released that the blockages within the depths of fit space are working their way out. I'll sometimes poetically say that the thorns are being sort of plucked out of your soul or the lumps in your soul or being worked through here. I'm just using soul poetically not in any. Theological or well defined, psychological sense to refer to the deeper more subliminal levels of feel image talk activity. One of the reasons that it's so challenging to untangle the field image dot is that it's not a one scale system. It's on the other end, it is definitely not an infinite mathematical fractal that where you just where you can drill down endlessly into subtlety? How many layers down are there? I have no idea. Some have postulated up to 4 layers in terms of the yoga. Chara school for example, in India but who knows? Maybe there's more this awaits a true neuron based neuroanatomy based science model for these systems. I don't know how many layers. There are down there, but you know it, maybe a half dozen this is a guess certainly. Not infinite literally, although it seems to us infinite because. Each one is exponentially both bigger an finer than its predecessors. So it seems to point to Infinity. But that's just an optical illusion. It's finite as far as I can tell and when you get to the base of the. Of the iceberg, so to speak you'll find that it is floating in the ocean of pure spirit. So I don't have to worry one of the things that makes it so challenging to untangle the fit system is that the tangling is at all those levels, but eventually it all sort of unwinds the skein on wines and things become very, very simple and when that happens, we could say that.

You can either say, well, I don't want to deal with choices at all, and you pick one technique and that's what you do. And so the basic mindfulness system was a catalog of techniques and. You decided to buy one and take it home and that's it. Another thing you can do is make a little workout sequence for yourself. Think of each one of the five ways. As a piece of Nautilus equipment and you're going to go through this. Psycho spiritual workout cycle every morning something like that. Uh. The metaphor with physical exercise is actually rather extraordinary once you start to make the comparisons is at least a dozen places where the the metaphor just works absolutely perfectly, including ending with focus on positive being analogous to going into the jacuzzi. I mean, it's like perfectly analogous because not only is it a pleasant bomb. After what might be a harsh reconstruction, but if you think about how exercise works. Exercise doesn't make you strong exercise destroys muscle. Exercises destructive but it's destructive in a way that helps nature. Improve. And the observing practices that we do in mindfulness. They deconstruct self and world. But in a way that helps nature reconstruct. Better. One of the things that helps the muscles rebuild in a good direction at the end is to go into the Whirlpool. So one of the things that I mean, the deconstruction. We do would automatically move you in positive directions anyway anyway. But you can help it along by ending with this jacuzzi and focus on positive which tends to then foster that direction. So it's actually a very nice metaphor. So you could just buy buy one technique keep things simple OK. I like to do I like to do, noting restful states body mind version? Relaxation peace blind quiet that's it. That's my practice. Or you can make a little workout. Sequence for yourself. Natural sequence. That I tend to follow is. Focus in focus out. Note restful states. Focus on change. And then do nothing. And then And with focus on positive but you can. Workout any sequence you want. Then. The most complicated way to use it is, you sit down and you decide. Which of these themes you'd like to pursue? And you start to do it and then you either stay with it and that's it or interest opportunity necessity comes up and you decide OK. I think I'd like to switch to one of the other approaches and that's a looping and branching algorithm gives you a lot of flexibility. But at the price of complexity, so simplest thing you can do just choose one and that's fine. Anyone of these ways. At one time historically was an entire path to enlightenment. So it's not like you know you're going to miss out on something if you do any one of them assiduously you should be able to get the classic results. Or you don't want to be a little more elaborate than let's hit all the Psycho spiritual muscle groups and you have this little workout routine want to be really elaborate. Then we come into the 21st century, the age of the algorithm. So now now. It's a flow chart and you're looping and branching to keep your interest up in to optimize the Efficacy. When I interactively guide. You we go to the algorithm, we loop in branch. And part of the reason that I set up the system this way is to optimize interactive guidance.","title":"Three Ways to Set Up Your Basic Mindfulness Session"},{"location":"expandcontract/total-happiness-1-of-5-may-happiness-be/","text":"You know what mindful awareness is as I say one person's paradigm. You also know that mindful awareness concentration sensory clarity equanimity are cultivatable skills that's an enormous discovered? So that these skills exist. Is a huge discovery than any human being? Who wants to was willing to allocate a reasonable amount of time in Enerji can cultivate these skills that's The cultivate ability of these things is utterly extraordinary, and this is the great contribution of Asia to have discovered. Systematic ways to cultivate these things and specifically India. Give credit where credits do they indic culture developed this like no other culture ever did science arose in the West. It's a real western thing now belongs to the whole world. The systematic ways to cultivate concentration power sensory clarity and equanimity arose India. Now they belong to the world that this is cultivatable and cultivatable to whatever extent you need it. This is this would be the gospel. I would say of Buddhism is gospel, meaning the good news well. There's the Christian version of what the good. Notes is the Buddhist version of the good news is anybody who really wants concentration clarity and equanimity kind of have as much of it as they need. If I had to put it in a phrase, If Somebody said why practice mindfulness. I would say. For total. Happiness. That phrase total happiness, which for me is a technical term that's a technical term highly technical term now. To call it happiness. Some People might object that that sounds frivolous, however. In point of fact the Buddhist greeting in the Pali language. The language that is closest to the Buddha himself is Suki Hoto. Which is usually translated may you be happy? But actually if you look at it grammatically. It's not may you be happy, it's me happiness be. It's a third person singular imperative may happiness being. Of course, implying to you, but everyone is the Universal Happiness Enlightenment in the sense of Nirvana on Ivana. Was referred to by the Buddha as dip Tadamasa Covey Covey Hara? Ditama means in the here and now. So Cummins in this case, we could translate happy and be harder means abiding. Providing and happiness in the here and now was. The book does. Reason to do this practice what he promised that People have to have so it's not ridiculous to define happiness as a technical term and then sort of look at that. So if you ask the average person. What what makes you happy? What do you mean by happiness? The first answer you'll probably get is. Something like this. I'm happy when. I get what I want what they're thinking of Primarilly is. I'll be happy when I get the conditions that I want. Object if conditions ordinary People, one of the things that they would want to get that would make them happy. Security. Security sex good sex relationships. Health. Good weather good job. A job money. Reputation recognition fame power. Good family life personal freedom freedom of expression food to eat. Water to drink her to breathe vitality strength. We covered it probe a little deeper well. People are thinking get object if conditions that I want think well. I use the word object in conditions circumstances. It's not just that we want to get certain things we also want to avoid certain things. Get a good reputation, but we want to avoid being shamed we want to avoid. The all the opposites of the good conditions if you had certain good conditions, but couldn't avoid certain other bad conditions that you wouldn't be happy, so there's also the notion of. Get conditions, I want and avoid conditions. I don't want. For example, I'll be happy when I have a good job and. My sister doesn't bug me anymore, OK, if we analyze a little bit more deeply. Anne asked the question well? How do we even know what are conditions are? The only way that we can know what our object if conditions are is through sensory experience. The parts of sensory experience that we that ordinary People call self. Are there body experience their physical and emotional sensations and their mind experience their visual thoughts and internal? Conversations internal talk. So most People would say. That I am my body my mind. When we talk about. The sensory experience part of happiness? What we get is I'm happy when I get sensory experiences, I want. And avoid sensory experiences, I don't want in body. In mind. I have a certain control over my image and talk there is what might be called a motor component. Thought is something you do it's an action. It's a form of Karma, but from another perspective thought could be looked upon as a sensory experience. Because thought comes to you through a visual means which is metal pictures and an auditory means which is internal talk so in the West mental experiences. It's not ordinarily thought of as a sensory experience. But I think it's very important to be able to. Conceptualize thinking as a tangible sensory experience because what's tangible is trackable and let's trackable is tractable.","title":"Total Happiness - 1 of 5 - May Happiness Be"},{"location":"expandcontract/total-happiness-2-of-5-ordinary-extraordinary/","text":"The sensory nature of thought seems to go very, very deep into the unconscious.

And the body is happy if it can avoid unpleasant sensations. Well, the mind is happy if it didn't get answers to things and the mind is happy if it can avoid confusion if it can avoid model. And model can be. Very intense. The aging process. Can model our minds very severely? Strong emotions can do the same losing our mental capacities is is. Not going to happen to every person but it's certainly going to happen to some People so not only do we?

It's going to happen to some of us OK job of the mind is to get to know stuff to get answers and when it can't get answers. Or we're still it's very ability to get answers is compromised and perhaps permanently compromised and the mines. Not very happy. So 2 things gets answers avoids the don't know and the model. For the month body is happy gets pleasant sensations, physical, emotional avoids unpleasant sensations, physical, emotional so that gives us a way to think about. Ordinary happiness mindfulness skills. Increase all these dimensions of ordinary happiness in contradistinction to the PO called ordinary happiness. There's another poll that contrast to that which could be called extraordinary happiness. Let's start with body experience? What we We think we want is to avoid unpleasant sensations. But what we really want is to avoid the perception of suffering that comes with unpleasant sensation. Perceived suffering. Equals intensity of discomfort. In the body. Divided by mindfulness. As concentration clarity and equanimity get bigger. Even though the intensity of the discomfort remains the same, the perceived suffering will diminish. And if Mindfulness becomes big enough. The perceived suffering due to physical or emotional discomfort in the body can be dropped to effectively 0. That's liberation from suffering of that sort. Mindfulness is directly related to a dimension of extraordinary happiness where our concern in the extraordinary happiness domain is not. Get rid of uncomfortable. Touch your field in the body are concerned is get rid of uncomfortable touch and feel if it's appropriate or if you can. But when you can't or when you should be experiencing those things because they motivate and direct you. Under those circumstances experience the mindfully so that they become more poignant. And less problematic. Although that seems somewhat contradictory. Their experience more deeply but the suffering the perceived suffering today this country drops so mindfulness pays off. Both ways allows the discomforts in the body to fulfill their function because you're having a complete experience of them You'll bring in concentration sensory clarity and equanimity to them. That's called a complete experience. That's not called getting rid of. Get rid of them and if it's appropriate or or you can and it's appropriate. But when it's not appropriate to get rid of them or you can't it would be appropriate. But you just can't. Then the mindfulness will allow you to experience that discomfort with diminished suffering and in the most extreme place no suffering. Again, the dimension of extraordinary happiness. Our goal is essentially not to avoid discomfort in the body. But to avoid suffering in the body by having a complete experience of discomfort in the body. Likewise, in the domain of extraordinary happiness. Our goal is not merely to have pleasure. But to have fulfillment now, it turns out that fulfillment equals pleasure multiplied by mindfulness. Small pleasure lot of mindfulness lot of satisfaction. Bad news big pleasure, not very much mindfulness. I can't get no satisfaction. The Imelda Marcos for not how many pairs of shoes will satisfy you. If you don't know how to derive fulfillment from pleasure. 100, * 0, is still zero 1000, * 0, is still zero 2000. I think that's what she eventually got up too, but. It couldn't deliver the goods I can't get no satisfaction. The dimension. Of extraordinary happiness are concerned becomes not merely getting pleasure. But deriving fulfillment and eventually. Enormous fulfillment from whatever pleasure is there. The preoccupation with avoiding. Discomfort is Replaced with the Noble Quest. 4. Freedom from suffering and the preoccupation with getting pleasure is replaced by the Noble Quest. Of achieving. Total fulfillment which of course implies? No more driven nahs. But does not imply imply for a moment, a lack of dynamic motivation. But you can have conditions that are producing pain in the body and there's no pleasure in the body. Still, happen extraordinary happiness is happiness independent of conditions. External object if conditions. What it mainly depends on is a user base level of mindfulness? And that's good news. Because. We can elevate our mind from us as far as we want so that means we can be in the realm of extraordinary happiness is no limit as to how happy we can be what about the mind. In the world of extraordinary happiness. The mines not preoccupied not in this or that question. It is interested in the question. And extraordinary happiness comes about when the mind gets the answer to the question and what is the question the question is Watt? am I? When the mines got an answer to that it knows its source. I would call that Salvation to know your source directly. And I would call that wisdom. The. Preoccupation with this with that question. Is in the realm of extraordinary happiness replaced with the preoccupation with the question?","title":"Total Happiness - 2 of 5 - Ordinary & Extraordinary"},{"location":"expandcontract/total-happiness-3-of-5-don-t-know-mind/","text":"Now you remember in the realm of ordinary happiness. The mind also needed to avoid something it needed to avoid not knowing it needed to avoid confused model states in order to be happy. But in the Demention of extraordinary happiness the mind can be completely confused. And that not be a problem. Now, when I say that the body can be in pain and that not be a problem. Maybe you think I'm cracked. But maybe you think Well, you know that could happen because I've had some experience where I was once in pain. and I stop fighting it and didn't bother me, so much lot of People have had that kind of experience once or twice in their life so maybe if I say. The statement, the body can be in pain in that not be a problem. Maybe I just sound a little cracked. I don't sound crack to everybody. But if I say that the mind can be in confusion. Even civility even Alzheimer's. And that might be a problem then People think. Maybe maybe is already too to be saying something like that. However. Equanimity with don't know. Is the basis? An extraordinary new kind of knowing. This fact has been discovered independently by 3:00 cultures and that indicates to me that it's universal. Totally independent without any contact with each other well there might have been some minimal historical contact. It was discovered by the ancient Greeks. the IT, meaning that you could suspend the need to know that you could train the mind away from its desperate need to have answers. And when you did, that it would start to have answers in new ways. That was discovered in ancient Greece by the sceptical philosophers who are called skeptics because instead of trying to find answers. They just observed skeptic costs, they watched. So the like what we do, they didn't. Ask questions like the other philosophers, they didn't debate. They let go of the need to have answers. And they discovered that if you do this in a consistent way as a discipline a disciplined suspension of the need to know. A disciplined confusion. A sustained confusion for a goal. Leads to a revolution in consciousness. They called the epic EEPOCHE, which means to suspend in this case, specifically suspend the need to know. It was rediscovered in the Middle Ages by Christian monks and nuns who called it dope to ignore anti and now we're going from Greek to Latin. That, it means. Cultivated don't know doctor learn it literally cultivated don't know where Catholic center here Carmelite Retreat Center. Venerable tradition. So who is the highest authority on the area of Philosophy in the Roman Catholic Church. The decline is yes, Thomas Aquinas. Who said They own Tom Club pair ignorant ium cognis pillows. In the language of the time. If I were to paraphrase into fully modern English. Would be if you want to know God directly. You have to know through a special kind of not knowing. And then it was discovered in Tang Dynasty, China, where it was called don't know mind and other things. Bodhi Dharma. When he visited. Imper. Long long booty. Emperor Wudi up the damn dynasty this master here visited the emperor. And they had a dialogue the emperor was a great patron of Buddhism. And the emperor asked Bodhi Dharma. I fed many monks and nuns built many temples how much merit have I made to which Bodhidharma said none whatsoever. I would sort of surprised the emperor and then the emperor asked him well. What's the highest principle of holiness to which he said wide open an nothing only. Which. Also surprised him very much. And finally, he said, who are you to which body Dharma said I don't know. So that's the Zen don't know mind 3 independent cultures have discovered that you can have equanimity with model and confusion. Now you might say well, OK, I can see that as a practice but come on senility, Alzheimer's. However. I have had the privilege of being with senile Masters. I have had the privilege of being with Masters, who had advanced outsiders. So I can report to you what it's like and it's. It's not like but it's usually like. It manifests in a very different way. Because. Of the practice in the realm of unconditional happiness. The issue is not getting answers to this, or that for the mind. The mines experience and the issue is not actually avoiding confusion for the mind. The issue is getting the answer. And the issue is avoiding confusion as a problem. To have a meaningful experience of the meaningless. So, in the realm of extraordinary happiness even if you were confused there would be a positive to that. And even if you were. Clinically, confused. Due to medical condition. It was still be on Okayness in that. That's why we say that the realm of. Extraordinary happiness is independent of conditions it's even independent of having having a functioning brain. This is an extraordinary claim. Independent of what condition the body and mind area if you are able to have a complete experience sensory experience of that touch field image talk state. Then you will be happy.

And in fact, we won't be happy unless that dimension is also their extraordinary happiness or happiness independent of conditions were merely OK to transcend the mind and body. Well. There's some pathological ways that People transcend the mind and body. But when People Tran send the mind and body in those pathological ways. The pathology leaks over into their behavior and that's how you know. But when People transcendent mind and body in a healthy way. The health must eventually. Seep into the behavior. And if it doesn't then they weren't taking feedback or there's some other problem. I take 2 dimensions in behavior. One might be called character talked about a little bit about that at the beginning of the Top character Cilla in the Pali language Sheila in the Sanskrit language. We can think of it in terms of positive behavior change everybody needs positive behavior change in their life. Well, it turns out that concentration power sensory clarity and equanimity are very related to changing our behavior. Because object is behavior is driven by. Body mind experience as you start to get a handle on your thoughts. And particularly your emotional body sensations. But also physical body sensations that might drive eating behaviors. And so forth touch field image talk are there? What drive our behaviors so if we want to change external behaviors avoid doing certain things. That we should be avoiding start doing certain things that we are procrastinating on those are sort of the 2 sides to behavior change well getting a handle on body mind states that are controlling those behaviors will certainly be relevant to controlling the behaviors themselves changing the behaviors themselves so character. Could also be called? Positive behavior change. What I have found however is that although concentration clarity and equanimity are very powerful tools to potentiates behavior change they may not be sufficient by myself. I won't go into details but most of you have heard. My own personal stories of struggles with behavior changes over the years an the fact that. I I just that not so many years ago spent 18 months with the psychiatrist. I'm working on a certain behavior issue. I needed something for the outside, some external behaviourally oriented force on me now I'll still say a large? Part of whatever success I've had with that behavior change has come from the practice. But I needed that external support I needed it from a mental health professional. The improvements in behavior. Improvements in character over the years. Is A is an important dimension in unconditional or extraordinary happiness another? Behavior demension besides the character piece. Is performance we have? Sports performance we have job performance. You know, there's academic performance. There are things where we want to be able to do the very best to be the very best that we could possibly be professionally intellectually academically. What have you the best that one can possibly do in terms of task performance that to me leads to extraordinary happiness because as I say. If you know you did your best even if it doesn't workout you'll still be happy. I put under behavior character improvement and performance improvement. Those are something that are object if although they are related to sensory experience. To sum it up. In the realm of extraordinary happiness. You're happy if your object of behaviors are. The best they can be. And you're happy. You avoid suffering and find fulfillment avoid confusion as a problem. And find the answer. Those taken together represent. Extraordinary happiness or happiness independent of conditions mindfulness skills impact all facets of ordinary happiness and all facets of extraordinary happens. But there's another dimension to happiness. We're not alone in this world what I just described is. Happiness for a person. So if I had. A lot of ordinary happiness and a lot of extraordinary happiness. I wouldn't yet be totally happy. I wouldn't be happy unless I did something to contribute to the happiness of others. For many reasons at the ordinary plane because I'm an ordinary human. And with regards to extraordinary happiness one of the facets of extraordinary happiness as you remember is to have the wisdom that knows your source. And if you know your source. You know who you are means you know where you come from? Where you come from is where everyone comes from an automatic consequences of that is, you cannot help but seeing everyone as sort of yourself automatically the issue of the happiness of others becomes relevant to you. If we want to speak of contributing to the happiness of others it makes sense. To consider that that service that contributing can be done. Both towards the ordinary happiness of others and towards the extraordinary happiness of others. So when you contribute to the ordinary happiness of others that's what People ordinarily mean by service. You support group causes. You give to charity you philanthropy eyes volunteering Hospice part or all of your job can be seen your work could be seen as service. And some People are fortunate that they have jobs with a large service component. If there a mental health professional or a health professional or in any of the helping professions. There's a large surface component right in what you're being paid to do. People find that very fulfilling certainly what you give to your family. Creation and raising of children, setting them up to half conditions have pleasure in their body, have knowledge in their mind. The main one for most People will be the family. The raising of the family is is the service to others. That contributes to the ordinary happiness of the world.","title":"Total Happiness - 4 of 5 - Self and Others"},{"location":"expandcontract/total-happiness-5-of-5-the-activity-of-teaching/","text":"The activity of fostering extraordinary happiness in others, I called teaching. Just by the fact that you do this practice, you are already a teacher in my very broad formulation. Because I distinguish 3 levels of teaching. The first level of teaching I call subtle teaching as the result of doing this practice. We change, particularly People who have known us notice it. But as it gets stronger and stronger as the months years and decades go on. Everybody notices it if only at some suttles subliminal level just where you're coming from has this impact on People. That's a huge servant to the world. So everyone that practices from absolute beginner to the master who can look at you and put you in a trance. Teaches at the subtle level, then the next level of teaching I called the explanatory level. Somebody asks you a question. About what you do and you can give a Coherent description of what you do Sunday did Kodomo that means that the Dharma is crystal clear. Somebody hearing a clear description. A model. Of this practice may think. That sounds desirable, even if you're not trying to Convince them that is designed. Just you being able in words to coherently describe what you do I call that the descriptive level of teaching. Explicit level of teaching you're saying. Hey, I'm going to teach you techniques. I'm going to teach you concepts. I'm going to show you how to apply this in your life in specific if you have questions or you need encouragement come. See me and we're going to have a sequence of lessons or I'm going to be giving sitting group that you can join and you could talk to me about your practice, I'm running retreats. Your explicitly now a teacher. I like to distinguish within the explicit teachers. Certain special sub categories of explicit teachers. First there's the paraprofessional. A number of you are paraprofessionals. At a retreat you can do all the explicit teaching that I just mentioned and put out your name to be a facilitator so that would be at a pair of profession professional means you're a full time. You live perhaps by. Arms. Dama In other words, Christian term is arms. Or you have a different fee structure but you you're a professional this what you do. There's a certain subclass of professionals. That. Are capable of confidently and competent Lee? Dealing with the issue of classical in alignment. Particularly can deal with that issue if a person happens to have a sudden enlightenment experience. We have to know what to say in those cases. Not every professional teacher can or for that matter. Is required to be able to deal with that issue? At least not in the be possible tradition. Then maybe a little different story. There is a watershed between teachers that can lead you to enlightenment. By teaching and teachers that can really deal with the issue of what happens if somebody does get enlightenment. That's That's a whole other from my perspective, that's a special skill. Also to deal with what very occasionally happens doesn't happen often, it's only happened a few times in my many decades career, but there can sometimes be a thing where People get. A sort of enlightenment experience that has a mixture of. Pathology with it. It's straddles enlightenment at a condition called DPDRD realization, depersonalization disorder. This. Special class of teachers can deal with that issue too. If it should come up so let's just call the Masters for now. For lack of any. Other term. Among Masters. There is a very, very, very special class of Master. That's a good time. Because it was asked what's the difference between A and on our hot rods fully aligned fully purified that what makes a certain are hot? And. The answer is. Where there was no path? He discovered a path and made it available to the world. That's the traditional formulation and I'd modify that a little bit. I would say. A single put. Is a master? Who discovers something new an important about enlightenment as a result of that? There is widespread and profound. Positive change in the direction of human history. Not just change the course of a few lives in a good way. So that's a bit. I'm not at all sure that the next but will be one person. The next put there may be a team. A team of enlightened scientists. For example, If we think of Buddha's meaning discovered something that has not been known in the past and that is deep enough and powerful enough to change the course of human history that might turn out to be a team effort. Might who can say. This thing gives us a map of total happiness. This is where we started. Ordinary. Happiness for yourself. Then we talked about. Extraordinary happiness. For yourself. Then we talked about. All these lead to service to others. Ordinary happiness for others. An extraordinary happiness for others. Under extraordinary happiness for others. I mentioned teaching there's one other category. And that is supporting teaching. That's done right, the dama that teacher Dhamma. When you support teachers, you support their efforts to bring extraordinary happiness to others. So nothing gives us I don't know if you could see this from where you are, but. This is This is the details filled in. So. Now we know. At least by. One way of looking at things what mindful awareness is we know that it is cultivatable to any degree. And. We also now have an idea of a lot of very wonderful things that can result. From mindful awareness things that mindful awareness fosters. Looked upon under the simple concept of total happiness.","title":"Total Happiness - 5 of 5 - The Activity of Teaching"},{"location":"expandcontract/tri-modal-rest-flow-thinning-out-into-nirvana/","text":"Rest states flowing is a huge window of opportunity.

I'm still going to be uncomfortable. I can see that that will change with time, and it will change in two ways. First your body will acclimatize to the posture. It'll just get used to it your legs will stretch your. Your muscles get used to it, and so forth and it won't be as uncomfortable as it is in your first retreat or several retreats, so there is a change that takes place in the body. More importantly, it change takes place in consciousness your relationship to discomfort gets rewired so that. Even when discomforts there, it becomes less problematic. It will improve with time due to these causes in general when you deal with a challenge. Of any sort the first thing you want to do is ask yourself. What is the sensory challenge involved here. So what what's involved in the sensory challenge of physical discomfort in your body is certainly the physical discomfort. However, there may be a significant component of feel image. Talk reaction to the discomfort. In addition to the discomfort itself. The physical discomfort. Has typically local intensities? But it also tends to have a global subtle spreading influence on your body your whole body. However, that global spreading influence maybe below the threshold of awareness. It may be subliminal. So you may not detect it. If you don't detect it. Then you don't work with it. Basic principle in mindfulness practice. You only work with tangible sensory experience. You don't sort of like well. I know some things there. What's wrong with me. I can't get to it. I can't detect it and so forth. I know there's this or that. Under there, you know why my blocking it, etc, etc. That's not the thought pattern that goes with mindfulness practice with mindfulness practice. It's whatever is available to the senses that is what you work on and whatever may be below. It well that gets worked on by a trickle down effect, so even though I say that there is often a global spread from the local intensities. It is also often the case that that is not detectable. And if it's not detectable don't worry about it don't be concerned, however, if you happen to notice that. That when you get a sort of local splash here, there's a little something here. A little here. Little here and those are touch their physical reactions to the local intensity. Well then if it's it's come up to the surface of awareness, then that's something that can be worked with. Potentially, the sensory components of your Physical discomfort are certainly an awareness of various local intensities, perhaps an awareness of a more global spread. This is all uncomfortable touch. Then reactive to that you may have mental pictures triggered by that. You may have announced could be pictures of the body part where the discomfort is or they could even in the extreme case be symbols that represent what's going on or they may be pictures of the energycap flows that are there like I used to get images of like knives stabbing OK or like Hammers banging like monsters like biting and things like that, and of course I call that. Disconcerting imagery right and then you get the talk on the talk is like Oh my God, Oh my God, or it's like all this sucks or ones is going to go away or you know, I notions ends asleep, the Bell should be wrong. Or it doesn't bother him, he doesn't get you know, he doesn't give a crap. It's like. But what about the rest of us, OK, so the overall gestalt is local touch, perhaps an awareness of a global spread of the touch and perhaps some. Subtle or not so subtle arisings infiel image Top so this. These all come under the category of what I call ordinary since sensory experiences, you formulate a strategy for working with this. So one strategy is focus away from it. Just ignore it all. That is a valid strategy if you can do it focus on what restful states. If you can positive feeling * talk if you can. Far I used to try focusing and actually I do this with pain patients focus on sights and sounds, but take you away from the body and the mind. It is valid to do that as long as you realize that that it's a mindfulness practice In other words. As I define it mindfulness is a threefold attentional skillset concentration clarity equanimity. Those don't all have to be directed towards the same sensory event. You can direct your concentration and Clarity Twords. Let's say the sounds while at the same time, having equanimity with the body mind eruptions. You just not intentionally focusing on them You're still having a cocoon of equanimity with the sensory challenges and sort of surrounding the sense, we challenge. It's just you're deciding I'm going to put my attention elsewhere and sometimes putting the attention elsewhere. It can really help with the equanimity. And give a chance for the eruption to sort of cool that. So it is not the case that that represents suppression or denial the focus away strategy. The way you know it's not suppression is that you are giving permission for that. Sensory challenge to arise. You're just not intentionally focusing on your clarity and concentration is being directed to something else. Which could actually help with the equanimity on that thing so it's not suppression because you're giving it permission to be there. You don't have an agenda that somehow you're going to make it go away. It's just your selectively attending elsewhere. That is number one and #2. On occasion, you're willing to turn towards it. If at least on occasion, you're willing to turn towards it. And when you turn away from it. UE quantum eyes, it, but your concentration and clarity is simply directed elsewhere. So you're still developing basic mindfulness skills by a focus away strategy. If your focus away strategy is formulated that way. Then you're not suppressing and you're not deny. Because on another occasion, you're going to turn towards it. You just developing the same basic mindfulness skill set in another way that is easier for you, or more attractive for. So it is OK to focus away from things if you have that very clear conceptual framework that I just gave you. You may or may not be able to focus away. Sometimes I can do it. I can like just focus on restful States and I can keep with the restful states to near fainting levels of pain. And it really it creates huge equanimity and huge purification flavors. I'm not focusing on the touch or the feel of the image just wherever I could find rest on just like relaxing and whatever I can do you know if there's some because pain? Can stimulate feel image talk but paying can also turn off feel image dog, creating peace blank quiet lot of times when you're in physical pain. You don't want to relax the body. Why why don't you want to relax the body when you're in physical pain because if you relax the body you'll become it's likely you'll become aware of the spread. That I'm talking about the tension that muscle tension in the body covers over that spread but actually it's Penny Wise and pound foolish 'cause if you relax the body then. Yes, now, the uncomfortable touch is going to suddenly take over your body when you give it permission to spread volumetrically like that. The pressure dissipates from the local intensity. Once you discover that then you're willing to relax the body. And let its and let it spread. So, sometimes, I just focus on restful States and let the pain drive me into deeper and deeper states of relaxation peace blank quiet. So if you can do that? Great. But you may not be able to do that. In that Case No problem. Alternate strategy turned towards it.","title":"Using 'Focus Away' w.

These the answer to all of these questions is the same answer. If we're going to do a focus on it if we're taking that strategy, the IT, meaning now. You name it anger fear sadness embarrassment in patients to discuss confusion. Any of the emotional challenges. Same basic principles apply? Untangle and be free. That's one really basic principle and then work with the parts work with the whole work with elements work with systems. In other words, work at small scale of organization work at large scale alternate wide scope and the narrow scope. So that you.

Apparatus the situation. And you let time pass. And when you have an intense emotional arising there's good news and there's bad news. The good news is feel, and image am talk all three elements of probably pretty strongly activated. When you get subtle emotional arisings. Mid scale or micro scale emotions that come up in daily life. They may not noticeably activate all 3. You might only be aware of the talk part for example. So there is in a sense, something good about having a big emotional Vesuvius. I know there's also like something bad about it because it's like miserable right. The opportunity is you probably have strong eruptions, not Justin talk space. But in image space and feel space. You remember the situation you relive the situation you rehearse about the situation. That's going to involve image space OK and then you've got the eruptions in field space better. Definitely not subliminal OK, there's you know, there's the ache in your heart OK. There's the butterflies in your stomach. There's the cold fear up here a spine. There's the general shake over your whole body. There's the tightness in the jaw. There's the I want to hit someone in the arms, etc, etc, etc. All the components are active. They're not subtly active it's all there. So work with the parts work with the whole. Focus for a little what's the weakest link often the weakest link his image. Space not inevitably. Of course, depending some People get some very strong things archetypal things weird things in image space, but I find for myself. Among the 3:00 if I have an emotional upper upheaval typically the image is the weakest link. An the next week is actually for me talk. The most challenging is the field. In the body. Physical discomfort. You can. You know your body has a natural tendency to go into equanimity with physical discomfort physical discomforts just part of being an animal. And it happens to animals, so the body sort of knows what to do. Uncomfortable feel actually any all the field, not just uncomfortable feel. Feel. The somatic component of emotional experience. When you're dealing with feel OK. I'm being poetic here, I don't feel understand. You're fighting with Darwin. You're dealing with something. That has been honed over millions of years to control you. It's been honed by evolution. To control us? To control our behavior. It's been honed to be hard to have equanimity. OK. Crowned by evolutionary forces. I don't know if you've ever had the experience of strong feel arising. And getting the sense that. This isn't just me. That this is like the this thing that's happening in my body is the tip of an iceberg and it goes down and out and it's like everyone that ever had this. Happened to them in their life all of millions and millions of sentient beings. This is not just me, I mean, this is like the whole evolutionary. Development of the limbic brain which goes back at least to advanced reptiles. This is the monitor lizard. It's like these sensations have been fine tuned by the greatest engineering force known to us, which is evolution. Sensations anger fear sadness embarrassment in patients discussed interest interest. You can't ignore either. If you wonder why you're running all those entertaining fantasies OK just look for the interest flavor. It's controlling you. You think the minds controlling but the reason you're running those entertaining fantasies is the interest flavor is saying. Fantasize entertain yourself and you'll get more of me. They're designed. To be That we can't ignore them and it's hard to have equanimity with them, meaning the different flavors of feel it's hard to be matter of fact about them, much harder than it is with regards to physical discomfort. However, they are just body sensations. And. When a person is 8 years old. They are controlled by rage tear grief and shame. Hopefully, by the time their 80 years old, they will have learned something but usually they haven't. And why haven't, they because every time those sensations came up. They could not be ignored and they could not be viewed matter effect. That person never attempted to untangle. Or just observe. Ah, etc, etc. No no growth in skill took place. Over that lifetime. So when it comes time to die and those things come up very strongly perhaps. Free card city. But good news. We're in this situation where we can train ourselves. Is this retreat environment? Is? It's vaccination against future suffering Stuffs coming up. And we're retraining deep circuits. So untangle. What part is feel what part is image? What part is talk you can free float among them all or you can just tease out just the image for awhile just the talk, for awhile just the feel for awhile. Tease them apart so that instead of multiplying together, they merely add. And then tried to the best of your ability to totally open and affirm that. Not press it down, but also to not hold on.

Feel, Image & Talk Challenges - 1 of 2"},{"location":"expandcontract/using-turn-towards-w-feel-image-talk-challenges-2-of-2/","text":"I find that I typically don't have just one flavor of challenging field. I may I may say to myself, I'm angry. But like and like I say I'm not sure this is true of other People or whether it's a stage in practice or just idiosyncratic to me, but I may say to myself, I'm angry, but when I look when I do a flavor analysis of what's going on? It seems to me that. It's like wine. It's got a full nose and it's got some tannins and there's hints of Raspberry. And Apple with with long syrupy finish. They give you this descriptions like? Did somebody just make this up I mean? Does somebody actually experience that when they drink this wine if you're not a wine connoisseur. It is like? What are they talking about? Well, there's all of these nuances in wines if you're into such things? Well, I guess I'm not much of a wine connoisseur for a number of reasons actually probably that's a good thing. But I have sort of become an affective some esthesia. Affect if is the fancy Latin word meaning related to emotion somas body as Thesia is sensation so affect if so much. Thesia is the long Latin Greek way of saying feel now. I detect all these subtle nuances. Like Yeah, it's anger. But that his sadness there and Oh yeah, there's this fear of my back, OK, so suddenly significant. Subtle flavors that may be very mild relative to the main flavor. If they multiply in have a huge effect if you got 10 unit SUV. Sad let's say 10 units of anger. But you got 2 units of. Fear. And 2 units of sadness. And you don't notice the fear and sadness. There, there, then instead of having 10 + 2 + 2, you're going to have 10. Times, 2, * 2. They're going to multiple they're going to weigh in multiplicatively rather than additively. That's part of what I mean when I say subtle is significant so. Divide and conquer that's another way of saying untangle and be free. So and if that doesn't work subdivide until you do conquer your noting feel image talk OK well. Maybe we need to divide the feeling to flame. And then I'd work just with the anger and then just with the fear flavor and just with the sadness. Flavor work with them individually until there is clarity is little more equanimity. Then, when I generically note feel I'm aware of all of 'em, but they've been individually clarified any quantum eyes so. Now, as an aggregate their clarified and quantum eyes if that doesn't work subdivide until you do conquer? What's after you broken it into flavors? What's next right the flavors into locations. I'll work just with the sadness. And I do what I call radio sweeping so OK, so I got the ache in the heart. So go to the core of that now how far does it extend to the rightness sort of sweep the awareness out like a cone going to the right until I come to the end of sensation. Maybe it's in the body. Maybe it's at the skin. Maybe it's between the skin on the wall. Maybe it's beyond the wall. I move out here, I get that whole sector. And it's like OK that's just the sadness just in that sector on the right come back in now. The sector on the left just that flavor? How far does it go now in front behind above below so I do flavor by flavors sector by sector. Until I get it to manageable pieces. It's a time space volume of one flavor of sensation. And that's That's Untangled enough so that I can. Penetrate that penetrate means get a sense that my awareness is soaking into it and my being is opening up to it, and then you integrate it. So I worked with all the flavors in all the different all the flavors in all the 6:00 sectors. OK and I worked with the image I worked with the talk OK. Now let's go back to generic too broad OK just not feel image talk, but now individually have sort of. Been worked with them individually. So now collectively their clearer and more equalized clothes getting closer to complete experience. You have to let go of the agenda. To get answers. And you have to let go of the agenda to get comfortable OK. The normal reward is get answers, I get comfortable. If you let go of the agenda to get answers and get comfortable. You still you still get a reward at some point you get the taste of purification. And even if you don't have answers and you're not comfortable. That's enough of a reward. Easy place to learn it in pain. Much more challenging place to learn it enraged her grief. Shame embarrassment humiliation. Is it learnable by? Me or you or actually any other human being? Absolutely. You just have to want it. You have to want it. You have to want it a lot you have to realize it's important. If you're willing to do that then. You. Start to see that yes, there's light at the end of the tunnel. Sasaki Roshi talks about becoming human being of complete feeling. OK. So that's an awesome attainment to be a human being of complete feeling. Can you do it? Yeah. Yeah, you can do it, there's no person in this room that can't do this, if they want to and if they take measures so the measures are implement the technique. Do it on a consistent basis here, you have nothing to do, but it it's wonderful in that sense, now of course. Because we're dealing with. In a sense the ultimate evolutionary challenge right, it's the robot. Trying to Gain control of itself. Trying to be free. The robot was designed by evolution to be a robot so it's the ultimate challenge really. When those sensations come up. They were designed by evolution to give. Immediate. Approximate. And intense responses. For the animal in the Velde. But. Immediate approximate an intense responses are not necessarily called for in human society. But because they were honed by evolution to do this. Instead of motivating and directing which there meant to do and that's fine. They often end up driving and distorting the they is feel active the feel flavors. Instead of motivating a directing. Which they do? Do many times and that's fine? We're not trying certainly not trying to get rid of feel. Or deny it in any way whatsoever, we're trying to love it to death. To completeness. When you have complete feel it only motivates and directs it does its job. It loses its power to drive and distort. But it's a long, long task. Yes, I just described a tough job. But somebody's gotta do it. Guess who those somebody's are.","title":"Using 'Turn Towards' w. Feel, Image, & Talk Challenges - 2 of 2"},{"location":"expandcontract/using-turn-towards-w-physical-discomfort/","text":"Now we know what the IT is in the case of physical discomfort. It's the local uncomfortable touch, possibly the global spread. And possibly feel image talk reactions that's the IT, however. I'm giving you general principle that you can apply to any sensory challenge. Now there's a tendency to think that Oh if I'm going to turn twords it. I have to turn towards the most horrible intense solidified part of it. However, that is, although there's nothing wrong with that that is certainly not necessarily the case. Where I like to start is I look at the sensory challenge and I ask myself? What's the weakest link? Which component in the sensory challenges least intense? I'm going to go for that first? Typically. For me, I find that the. At least at the beginning of the discomfort the least intense components are actually the feel image talking reactions. They're not too strong, yet they're just a subtle hint. So often, I'll start with that I won't even go to the uncomfortable touch. I'll go to OK. What's going on in feel image talk reactive to this, or in general? What's going on. Because I know if I if at some point I lose it and freak out the freak out is not in touch space and freak out is in fit space so I want to get some momentum going in and if at some point become unwilling to practice you know, I like to hell with this. Etc, etc. That's going to happen in fit space, not in the physical bottom touch space can take a lot feeling in stock space is pretty vulnerable. So so I start in feel image stock. Then when I go to touch I tried to detect the subtle global spread if I can. And after many, many years of practice usually I can. and I work with that. It's widespread but it's not that intense relative to what's happening locally, so I sort of like work with that. I note that touch touch sort of zoom into those things, sometimes zoom out to try to get the whole spread it once which does help with the dissipating zoom in means work with a small part zoom out mean so that's spread. The attention over the whole thing, then I go into the local intensities. So, which is that's the strongest link. So. When you work with the sensory challenge, you could focus away. Or you can focus on it when you focus on it, you want to get a very clear classification of the sensory challenge all its components. And then decide well do I want to go to this, which component do I want to go to know. I want to work with them. All at once, etc, etc. So like I say I typically work with the weakest link and then I sort of work my way up and then I work with it all at once. But usually by that time, it's breaking up into flow. Meaning that it's not so solid anymore. It's beginning to show way. Venus bubbliness that kind of stuff. So now I'm noting touch feel image talk, but it gets very flowy, so at some point I'm just zooming out and I'm covering touch feel image. Talk all 4 simultaneously as a flow field. They integrate into a single body mind arabesque of Energi. And if it works right the. I just get this. Flavor of purification and get this sense that. Because of the way that I'm. Experiencing this moment every moment of the of my life in the future is going to involve less suffering and more fulfillment. And Furthermore, the poison and pain that has been stored from the past, is getting worked out. So the present is reaching into the future, making a brighter future for me and the present is reaching back into the past and cleaning that up for me, I called that experience the flavor of purification. Probably the most important watershed in a person's practice is when they start to develop an awareness of that flavor because after that, it takes off like a hockey stick. It's exponential because now now you're getting a reward an actual reward for your for your mindfulness you're actually tasting. Not. You know when the retreats over you know when the sits over. But like right now in this instance, you're tasting that this is doing something significant and productive for you so there's. Not a reward there, I personally. Have seen People. Sit for 3 days without moving. And I could tell you how it's done. Stung with a smile on the face. So so Watt. Somebody's genetically engineered to do this a human can do this. No a human can train themselves along the lines of what I just said, so that the sense of this is meaningful an purgatorial. As opposed to meaningless and hellish. That sense is present moment by moment and so there's a smile on the face even though the pain is hour after hour right on the cusp of fainting intensity. And this is the easy thing. Now you want to know what the hard thing is. OK, this isn't that easy I know. But relative to something else. This is relatively easy when the uncomfortable touch breaks up. You're beginning to have a complete experience of uncomfortable touch when the uncomfortable touch turns into purification flavor. You're well on your way to complete experience and you remember, I talked last night about. The two things right getting over the self in the world and improving the self in the world. You get over the self in the world by having what I call a complete experience of yourself and the world. The relatively easy thing is. To have a complete experience of uncomfortable touch. The harder thing is to have a complete experience of uncomfortable feel.","title":"Using 'Turn Towards' w. Physical Discomfort"},{"location":"expandcontract/vanishings-and-noting-gone/","text":"OK, so I wanted to. Talk about one of the themes of focus on change, which is noting abrupt Deminishing's. And my simple one word label for that is gone. But as with all the words that I use virtually all the words that I use. We have to be careful because the meaning is not identical to the meaning and colloquial English when we say gone. It implies gone for good typically it's like gone in a date coming back, but gone is just an abrupt diminishing of something that you happen to notice has abruptly diminished so it doesn't mean that it won't come back instantly, but it's still gone. Also gone does not imply every part of it is gone. You could be observing an image. And let's say it's a person so there's ahead. There's arms and so forth. And at some point. The arm, disappears, but the rest of the images there will arm abruptly vanish is evaporates so that was a partial vanishing part, part of what you observing disappeared you notice *** you note that has gone. So gone does not imply gone for good. God doesn't mean that every single part of what you were observing disappears. For example, let's say that you have a widespread sensation in your body sensation arises like burst of pain. And it's got a local and it spreads out broadly. Let's say that you zoom out to cover it. You implement that option with the noting and as you're covering it like the left quadrant sort of like. Abruptly, collapses, the rest of the pain is there, but a chunk of it went cut Chuck. So that's an abrupt vanishing of part or an abrupt diminishing perhaps a diminishing to complete finishing. So, in abrupt, diminishing of part of what you're observing that counts is it gone so part of it to disappear and it may or part of it can abruptly diminish and it may abruptly diminish all the way to no longer existing or it might just abruptly. Damen ish sort of to lower level or a smaller size. So essentially flow is change that in some way is continuous. It's either WAVY or it's like pixelated so that even though each one of those little vibrations might in itself be disconnected. They sort of like tend to form something that seems fluid. But abrupt diminishing's at the macroscopic scale. Those are used the word God for that. There is a tendency to assume that this is a very esoteric category and you know, maybe a 5 meditate for 20 years. I'll be able to detect this so disabuse yourself of that notion. Every in breath comes to an end. Every out breath comes to an end. That's a touch sensation and it ends and it's obvious that the flavor called in breath that sweep of sensation stops for a moment and is replaced by the flavor called out breath. So don't ever say that I can't detect any vanishings. That's always there. Now you might say well. That's trivial, but all gonza run created equal. I don't know if you quite catch the significance of that phrase. Maybe that just seems like a very enigmatic and strange way. Maybe you think I'm just wordsmithing to get your attention or to make it sound like I'm. I know something that you don't or who knows what OK but all gonza run created equal. Doesn't matter how? Ordinary and Banalities, an airplane is passing and it's like sound sound sound sound sound gone. Let's say, well, so of course doll. However, as you. Are. Paying attention to that kind of thing you are gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually over a long period of time. Developing a sensitivity. To detect the unborn source of consciousness. Each one of those is a little Teeny. Learning. That, in and of itself. Would seem completely trivial, but once you begin to some that. Over many, many, many, many instances. Let's be honest, probably over weeks months. Years of practice. Uh. You start to notice that those moments of gone as I have defined it. It seemed to be momentarily adverting that is to say. Directing. Your attention towards. Something that's actually not a thing. And. Therefore, it can't really be sensorially experienced but. Can be contacted let's put it? It can be contacted through the senses? It just can't be experienced as a sensory experience. And as you contact that more and more and more and more. 10, * 100, * 1000, * 10,000, * 100,000 times. If you have that category. Uh. It starts to become clearer and clearer and clearer to you. Now the clear can only be in your senses obviously. So you might say that the. After effect of noticing Avanish Inge. Becomes more and more and more well defined in your sensory circuits. And you begin to discover some rather things that are intuitively obvious and some things that are actually quite counter Intuitive. What is intuitively obvious is that if you're having an unpleasant experience in your body and your mind and you're able to pay attention to the moments when parts of advantage that gives you a sense of relief. What is not at all intuitively obvious is if that you're having a pleasant experience and you notice the banishing that that increases your sense of fulfillment. That is actually quite counter Intuitive. However, it is sensorially true, although logically it doesn't make any sense at all. The Tibetans have their own enigmatic phraseology. I'm not the only person in the Buddhist world that speaks the talks weird. The Oneness of Bliss and void. One in the world is that well actually it refers to a whole lot of things but. In the end, it's what I just talked about. And what is also not intuitively obvious is? If you have a neutral experience one that is neither pleasant nor unpleasant. And you know it's finishing. That there is great sensory fulfillment in that also it is intuitively obvious that if you notice vanishings that that might. Reverberate through your senses as a restful experience. That is the result of noticing the moment when a burst of talk comes to an end. Might be followed by some quiet. That's intuitively obvious. That you can have relative rest states what I call relaxation light silence peace blank quiet. So someone or a combination of those could begin to pervade your sensory experience as the result of noticing vanishings. What is not intuitively obvious? Is that? A sense of great richness. Should come? From noticing vanishings it would seem like Bleakness would come from noticing vanishings. But actually a sense of richness can result. The way I like to conceptualize that is that? The complexity of self and world is reduced to the simplicity of flow waves. And but that then. Contains within it all the richness of the self and world is in those waves and when the wave comes to an end. In the gone. The richness is still there, the re chests. Is still there? The assumption is. When you're given this category that you are supposed to be able to detect gone. In all your sensory experiences that side sound feeling miss talk relaxation light silence peace blank white. Uh. If you make that assumption, then you are setting yourself up for failure. That is not the assumption. If you do focus on change restricted to noting vanishings, noting God. The assumption is you will be able to find banishing somewhere in your sensory experience. If only Are. In the fact that if you have a lot of chatter. You have a lot of sentence is if you have a lot of sentence is you have a lot of periods each one of those endings. Is a God talk talk on talk on? Or. You're still alive, so you're going to take another in breath and it's going to come to an end. You're going to take another out breath and it's going to come to an end. So the assumption is that you can find gone if you have a lot of chatter and if you're still breathing. And the assumption is that that's all you ever have to focus on in order to do the technique absolutely perfect all gonza run created equal. Sorry owes teacher. Uh. Gives People koans of course, it's Rinzai Zen, but he says. I'm hope I'm not misquoting but I think sorry. You said this the very best students don't need koans. They do their entire enlightenment process with the breath. Noticing. That what happens at the moment when the in and the out breath ends. What happens at that instant is all there ever is ever? So that's complete enlightenment, you're living inside 0. So that's a few things to say about this theme. Ending in Sanskrit is Nero to an IRODHA. And. That's also a synonym for Nirvana. And Nirvana means to blow out literally but it also means to quench. Fire of suffering. But it also means to quench your thirst in the sense of being completely in Totale fulfilled hence the recess. In the void.","title":"Vanishings and Noting Gone"},{"location":"expandcontract/vipassana-mindfulness/","text":"Literally. If we look at the etymology that is to say the origin of the word Vipassana. We can analyze it into the prefix vi and the word Passana. Passana means seeing. It comes from the root pus in Poly or push in Sanskrit, which means to see Pusha T is to see. And although it might not be immediately evident actually that route in Sanskrit Pusha T is related both to the Latin Spec array. Spec, which means to see Spec becomes splash becomes push in Sanskrit and it's related to the Greek scope skepsis that kind of thing. Essentia Lee, the car sound of Indoeuropean can sometimes become a share sound in Sanskrit, so that's how you get Spec becoming splash, becoming push an V has. Several meanings it's actually derived from V. And we is the same route that gives us duo or the English word 2, which is really 12 right TW Oh so the DV and the TW. Are the indoeuropean root? That means 2:00 or separate or apart so the corresponding Greek word? Is dia di IA? Which would have been pronounced dia in ancient Greek if you look at how dia is used in forming words in English. Dia has a meaning of through. For example, diathermy is to send heat through a person as a healing modality on the other hand. Dia also means apart or separate for example, a diagnosis is to know separately. Ortenau distinctly a diacritic is a distinguishing mark something that allows you to separate similar things so. Not surprisingly, the corresponding word incense or the corresponding prefix in Sanskrit V. Means those 2 things it means both separate. And through so literally vipasa not would mean to see separately. But it would also mean to see through. So see separately in my interpretation is the ability to separate the basic sensory elements of experience which I like to classify in terms of touch sight sound feel image and talk. I've described the meanings of those elsewhere, so the person not in the sense of separate sensory. Elements we can also have even finer separations different flavors of field can be separated different flavors of touch. You can distinguish different kinds of images images that are of People places versus objects. And so forth so to separate the sensory strands is one meaning of V plus or not to see separate. But we personal also means to see through that means that. Once you separate a strand you intently focus on that strand and your awareness sort of soaks into its interstices and that has the effect of. Causing it to soften dissolve. So that it shows you it's empty and vibrant nature that seeing through or soaking in aspect also has the effect of. Reaching down into the subliminal neural circuitry into the unconscious itself, so that there's a kind of trickle down of clarity bound to the depths of. Ones subconscious levels of processing so I take vipasana to mean the 2:00 fold. Endeavour of separating strands and then soaking into those strands and literally seeing through their something that's Now the person are also. Has a third meaning the V can be combined with person ought to mean insight In other words, the haha or wisdom experience. The change in paradigm. That we call. No self or insight into the marks of existence or enlightenment that change in paradigm that wisdom or insight. Is also implied by the word rip us enough so vipasana means? Separate as I'd like to interpret it anyway, it means separate see apart. See through and see into your true nature or insight and it has all three of those meanings. In one word so we don't have anything like it in English. There's no English equivalent. There's no word in English. That means separate your sensory experience into natural components soak your awareness into those components and as the result of that you will experience a paradigm. Shift called Wisdom Vipasana means all of that as one word. So, in my usage, I Essentia Lee Usvi personal and mindfulness as synonyms now strictly speaking. Historically, the word mindfulness goes back to suti or such a Patana goes back to a different word, but really the notions are in my way of thinking are. Essentia Lee, the same, the way I like to set up my definition of mindfulness involves the separating the soaking into which I call the sensory clarity. Of course in order to do that, you have to have concentration power and then. The equanimity piece is not implied by the word. Repulsa not etymologically. But in terms of practical practical considerations. All mindfulness teachers emphasize this sort of gentle matter-of-fact sometimes it's defined as non judgmental. That's not the term. I use but I prefer the more traditional equanimity term, but all vipasana teachers emphasize. That, In addition to the clarification aspects, so that's sort of how I understand the terminology.","title":"Vipassana & Mindfulness"},{"location":"expandcontract/what-are-your-specialties-as-a-teacher/","text":"Someone wrote in and asked what are your specialties as a teacher? I think the first thing that comes to my mind. Is that I attempt to take the missed out of mysticism? All around the world we find People that have had deep experiences of meditation. And perhaps gone beyond deep experiences of meditation to experiences of no cell for enlightenment. And scholars of. Comparative religion, who study such things say that they're studying comparative mysticism. I think a more contemporary term would be contemplative studies, but it pretty much boils down to the same thing. Mysticism sometimes refers to what I call the realms of power that sort of like the new aging kind of stuff. That might be called mysticism with us small app. But mysticism with a capital M as is used by trained scholars of world religion has a very different meaning it means the path into deep States and then the path beyond deep states to experiences of quote Enlightenment if you look at the standard works on mysticism. Most of the older ones. Unfortunately written by People that were not themselves Mystics. Which is a little bit like sex manuals written by perpetual virgins? It's Books on the nature of music written by People that are told death or maybe deaf. But if you look at some of the older books on mysticism. The first thing that always appears is. This can't be described in words OK. That's almost the defining feature of mystical experience now it is quite true. Within. The core of mystical experiencing experience of direct contact with the source there. Most assuredly are no words. No words in your head no words coming out of your mouth. Because there's no help there's nobody there is no time there's no space so certainly know once that is true? But can everything surrounding that be. Precisely put into words. I think so actually. That goes against a lot of established doctoring, but I think we can do this we meaning the human species with enough time, so I would refer to that as taking the missed out of mysticism. Or another way to put it is developing a? A vocabulary around. These really deep spiritual practices that has the same precision and rigor as the vocabulary that has developed within science and mathematics. Now it took a long time and. Centuries of contention and confusion. For science to develop the precise vocabulary, it now halves. This was not and not a quick thing and not an easy thing we can speak about the natural world, in a very powerful and precise way. Now, which we couldn't save 500 years ago, 1000 years ago and so forth. So I think something like that can occur with regards to the mystical or contemplative experiences that are universal to humans around the world. So I call that taking a missed out of mysticism. And that's sort of one of the things that I view as my specialty. Another thing that I view as a specialty is that the. Way that I Work with People. Is interactive? In other words, my system is designed to be taught and deepened and sharpened. By real time interaction with the coach. So if you come to a residential retreat with me. You will have at least 1 or 2 times where you'll have 90 minutes where it's just you and me. Well, not exactly just you its? Um effectively just you and that's a little complicated to explain how I do that. But I multiprocess. Several People working on telephones, but each one is privately working with me, I give you a technique. You get set up I go work with somebody else 510 minutes later, I come back OK, when you did. That technique this, or this may have happened. Tell me which one happened depending on what you tell me were going to either keep to the same guidance slightly modify it to give you some new information give you a choice of options suggests that you do this, etc, etc. It's an algorithm that loops and branches, then I get you optimized your optimize now for the next 5 or 10 minutes. I'm off processing somebody else doing the same thing for them. You don't, they don't hear what you're going through 'cause you're all on separate telephone lines and then I come back to you OK what happened. Um now if you call me up at home if you're someone that comes to my retreats. I actually give you my own home telephone number and you can call me at home. Then you have one on one interactive session with me. Unlike traditional systems. That sort of like OK. Here's the cushion. Here's the technique now go off and do it come back in a few hours come back in a few days come back and. You know, whatever and we'll see what's happening. I do Micro Interactive coaching like having a personal coach next to you, while you're using pieces of exercise equipment. My metaphor is that my five ways are exercise stations. And if you have. Someone from the staff of the YMCA is next to you while you're using the Nautilus equipment. You're going to have an optimal experience of using it so another specialty of mine is this interactive. Personal coaching way of teaching the practice. Another thing that may be unique. I don't know if it is unique. But it may be unique to my approach is that I didn't develop my approach alone. I developed my approach. Through taking feedback from students and taking suggestions from students. Maybe 50% of what's innovative and what I teach I didn't discover a student discovered sometimes a student with not a whole lot of experience, but and interacting with them. They had sort of seen something that was very significant so for 3:00 decades, I've been. Intensely collaborating with my students developing the five way system. It wasn't just like OK. I'm alone, then I'm going to figure out how to do this so it's actually been sort of distributed collaborative endeavor and that maybe that's certainly is unusual in the history of these things I don't know if it's entirely unique. But it's probably another distinctive feature of what I do.","title":"What are your specialties as a teacher"},{"location":"expandcontract/what-is-enlightenment/","text":"Can you tell me what enlightenment is? So. Moment by moment you've probably noticed that you have thoughts right. Set correct and moment by moment you probably notice that you have body sensations. You've also probably notice that as soon as a thought arises or body sensation rises. There's a tendency to say this thought is me. At this sensation is me. That correct nothing mysterious so far. The next part, you have to sort of use your imagination. Imagine that you still had thoughts and you still had body sensations, but they? No longer immediately trapped your identity. So, your identity is free free to be inside your mind a body like it was before, but also free to move outside of your mind and body to inhabit briefly anyone's mind and body to merge with them. Or to embrace the entire universe. Or to abide the still point of the turning world beyond time and space. Nothingness that precedes The Big Bang so to speak metaphorically speaking. So. After Enlightenment, People's identity becomes elastic. And the mind and body is no longer. A place you're locked in it's a home you comfortably can abide in but you can leave anytime you want. And that's why we also call it liberation being set free.","title":"What is Enlightenment"},{"location":"expandcontract/what-to-expect-and-do-after-a-mindfulness-retreat/","text":"Appan leaving the retreat. Some things that are good to keep in mind. Exactly 1 of 4 things will occur. In the days subsequent to this retreat for all of us those of you that have heard this talk before know what those 4R. Can you remember its exhaustive and exclusive classification of the basic effects of a retreat? You will. Either have Afterglow only. Or you will have aftershock only. Or you will have both. Or you will have neither. So what do we mean by afterglow? Well afterglow tends to? Occur more and more frequently as the months years and decades of practice progress. It tends to be more and more predictable result of periods of intensive practice, although not absolutely guaranteed. So after glow means you're calm and peaceful you've got all sorts of energy and vitality and cascading insights, maybe even Epiphanes. As I always say People have no difficulty processing afterglow. So what is aftershock? Aftershock is your incredibly a sensitive. Tiny little things rattle your cage, you know that's a great expression rattle the cage if you've ever thought about it. The cages are some scar's right. Are the limiting forces deep within us? Ann. Things happen in the world and it rattles that prison of. The habit forces. And that's OK because otherwise. Bars of that prison will never be broken. Without them being rattled in the within the context of the practice. So. It when it happens during a retreat. It's called Yogi Mind, Yogi is the Buddhist context means us meditators are yogis so that's sort of like. Hypersensitivity and things just like you know. Causing ballistic reactions and so forth. Um that's a natural part of this path. A part of the deep insights and purification So what happens during a retreat. We call it. Yogi mind well when it happens after retreat. I call it my own word for it is aftershock. So you're like really sensitive and vulnerable and this like no skin on you to shield you from the insanity of. The 711 And also this sense of stuff percolating up from the inside like there's nothing holding it down your order ordinary ordering principle seems to have been blown away well. That's the price. You pay for deciding that you want to have an extraordinary ordering principle. So we have sort of OK away that we were stable. And now but and it sort of works, but we could be destabilized. So we want to have a deeper kind of stability. But we may have to go through a temporary period of instability. And then we go to this new new depth so. It may seem that you've lost your ordinary ordering principle don't worry about it, you're on the path to an extraordinary ordering principle. There can be because of that disorientation sense of disorientation. And so forth these are the phenomena of aftershock. Uh. So. If you have, I'm not saying you will have aftershock but some People do. If you do have aftershock all you have to do is remember 2 things. Why it's happening and what to do about it? If you remember those 2 things you'll be fine. This path is. A path of. Uh. Learning a new coping mechanism. For human existence. The normal coping mechanism for human existence could be characterized by the phrase tighten up and turn away. The Titan lap, meaning don't have equanimity in the turn away meaning. Don't be clear don't pay attention to things so if we're learning clarity and equanimity. Yet then were innocence. Learning the opposite coping mechanism that most People use. So since the 2:00 coping mechanisms are in some sense diametrically opposed. We can't avoid from time to time in our growth process. what I call awkward intermediate stages, where the old coping mechanism has been somewhat shed. So the measure, the being is somewhat open. But it's not so fully open that things just pass through. But it's not closed the way it used to be that. Relatively Shields, us, but not really so in that awkward intermediate zone. We get aftershock phenomenon that's why we feel vulnerable disoriented. Sensitive to The Big 3. Anger fear sadness in various forms. And our cage gets rattled and so forth. So there's an old cliche about the only cure for the ills of democracy is yet more democracy and the only cure for the ills of these temporary side effects of the panacea and powerful radical Medison called mindfulness. Is more mindfulness? So that's why it's happening. What to do about it recycle the reactions the practice caused reactions? The reactions come up in touch feel image stock typically feel image talk. Typically feel. Um what to do well, you have techniques. And we you apply the techniques to those reactions. And that optimizes the growth process. So what if you can't remember that. To do that. Because I sometimes say that there's a an inverse relationship between. Activation of feel space and IQ. Have you noticed this is something that we humans. This is one of the great humility, humility pieces of being human? At least it has been for me to acknowledge that field space gets activated. Uh particularly with negative field. My intelligence drops. And therein we have? What is probably the fundamental engineering flaw in our species. Which is? That the field is actually meant to motivate and direct rapid response to situations. But Unfortunately it. Can also drive in distort? And so a situation comes up it activates feel. And we need to act. But our intelligence is diminished, but still, we are convinced. We have to do something and therefore what we do is sometimes less than optimal? How do you know that because 5 minutes later or 5 days later or 5 years later you look back and say? Why did I do that? So. And during times in my life when I've had a lot of emotional stress is. And this phenomenon has been sort of on the surface like day after day after day, which is bad, but also sort of good because you can get. Is sort of like get to know it 'cause? It's like head? Ain't going away so you learn things or one of the things I notice twas. Oh yeah, I can see as the feel activates my ability to organize words to respond coherently to think coherently I can see it just goes down. And when I when I realize that it's like OK. Unlike. I'm like Room temperature IQ now an I'm trying to respond to this. It you know complex situation and I realized I shouldn't be doing this, I just have to walk away. And just meditate until I get a little smarter again. Uh so in any event if you can't be amazed that you may not be able to remember what I just said when the Doo Doo hits the fan. Then you're going to need to remember something simpler than this formulation. And. That thing you need to remember is the location of my telephone number. Or someone like me. Who can remind you of what you already know? And then take you through step by step. When I get calls from People so here's how it works. I think you all know this, but let me just repeat it. So I turn off my Phone when I close the Dharma store for the day whenever that is. That makes it easy, because there's People all over literally all over the world that may want to call me. An the rule is simple call. If the Phone rings. The Dharma store is open. I don't care if it's 3:00 in the morning. Eastern Time, where I live and you'll get me. If the Dharma store is closed you'll get the the voicemail and if I'm away on retreat. That's the bad news? It may be awhile before I can get back to you. I try as I've been answering calls during this retreat. So, but I can't necessarily get back that immediately. You don't have to call me when it's a crisis, though. You can call for tuneups or what have you. When People call it an it is a crisis. I'm happy and sad? I'm sad that the person is in a crisis. I'm happy because I know there's a based on years. Decades actually of experience that there's a very high probability that person. After we worked together for an hour, 2 hours or whatever it is will experience what I call MBE maximum meditation mileage. Out of whatever they're going through. So that's how that works so now you know about after glow aftershock. Both could happen at the same time you can have. Like the afterglow stuff and the aftershocks stuff or you might not get any of these effects. Now the tendency is to think. If you don't get afterglow or aftershock, then well, I you know. I it wasn't a productive retreat, but that's not at all true. The gold standard for? When People want me to evaluate is there practice working I never ask them about their subjective experiences. While they're doing formal practice. I I only ask 1 question and looking around the room and I know I've asked. This question for about 1/2 the people in this room touch base with your practice. It's only one question that I asked first which is does it seem that you're that you're more fulfilled an suffering last and your behaviors are improving in the real world in daily life of the answer is yes, then the practice is on track. So it doesn't have anything to do with did you have aftershock to drive after going? Did you have flow? Did you have this? Did you have that? It's like OK? Watts the impact in daily life? So. Now you know the four things that could happen and why they're happening and what to do about them. 5 things you need to be successful with this practice. Keep them in mind, appan, leaving the retreat. You need to do a little bit of self practice, most days, I have a ludicrously small minimum. 10 minutes, but that's 10 minutes of real formal practice, not 10 minutes of bubble bath meditation. Or meditation while you're doing, Taiji try. Not that there's anything wrong with Taiji Tran or whatever, but talk about sitting practice. And if you only do 10 minutes, then do it was spoken labels. So you if you don't have quantity you gotta guarantee quality. So little bit of self practice each day that's one thing. Uh. A lot of practice every once in awhile typically that's in a group is called a retreat, although you can do self retreats. You can just go off by yourself and Meditate, but the point is it's like a jam session as opposed to daily practice. You doing a lot of practice all at once. That's what we came here and we have achieved that. Little bit each day, a lot every once in awhile. We have to be make an attempt to bring it into daily life. Try to pepper the day with. I call it practice in life. You know 30 seconds here. A minute there. While you're walking to the washroom while you're waiting in line. Go to some technique of your choice. So that you're not going unconscious unbroken all day. So every day there's there's little at least surgical strikes in the thrust of life and you've heard me say over and over again. That, it is pivotal that you develop the ability. To start on a die? All rest. Site. Side. All rest. Sound. Touch or if I wanted to go in feel. Feel. All rest. Image. Ready to go anytime. Just at the drop of that and as I said in the group process why. Because when stuff comes up in daily life. You've got a magic window of opportunity of about 2:00 to 3:00 seconds. To establish mindful awareness. After that, the terrorists are in the cockpit. They are running the show. An they could well. Crash your karma. So there's just that little window and you have to train yourself to instantly be on it. With some technique in day-to-day life. Otherwise, it goes from sensory experience into object if behavior. And if the object is behavior is driven and distorted that's called making karma. Law of Karma what goes around comes around. Meaning that they'll be a lot more uncomfortable feel image talk than just that in the end than just that moment of feeling stock that you failed to be complete with. So it multiplies. So if possible, we want to avoid that happening. So. Little bit each day. Lot every once in awhile pepper the day with micro hits. And have some sort of regular contact with teacher coach doesn't have to be just one teacher and it certainly does not have to be the perfect master. Should be somebody competent to guide you? And typically you get that you're guaranteed of that contact with. Coach or trainer. When you come to retreats like this, or if you do the home practice program, which are telephone based retreats during the self. There's an hour of self practice in those 4 hours where you can call whoever is running the retreat. And get that way you can get theoretically monthly contact during that retreat situation so. Some sort of contact with somebody who can monitor the big picture of your practice. So that's 4 isn't it a little bit each day lot every once in awhile pepper the day with micro hits at least. Every once in a while certainly wants certainly you know every six months or so. Contact with somebody that's watching the big picture of your practice? What's number 5, #5, is keep that up for the duration. It's were in it for the long haul. Time is basically our ally. So you get results you know, some quicker some not so quick, but you just keep it up. So those are the 5 things you need to be successful on this path. You might say I don't have much time that last factor cause I'm old well another factor enters in. Which is the aging process? Is a natural enlightenment process? Now the fact that it doesn't turn into that? It often is not the fault of nature and it's the fault of human culture. But if you have a practice then it's much more likely to be that an so it becomes an ally so it takes you to the no self. So you've got enough time. So let's see 4 things that can happen after retreat. 5 things you need to be successful, with this practice, so with regards to the periodic re treatments. What I recommend is that? When you complete. Any given retreat you sign up for the next retreat. As a habit. You mark it on your calendar in ink. You pay. In advance and put down a deposit you tell everyone you're going to do this retreat. It's a Fed Accomplis. If every time you complete a retreat you. Guarantee you sign up for the next retreat in it's on the calendar, then each retreat generates its successor. And you're guaranteed of a lifetime of retreats, so if you make that habitual that's very good. That's a very good thing to do on I would strongly recommend that. The very first day I see our times doing OK got a little bit more. The very first day I talked about what's the big picture. The big picture is this path is about. Transcending the self in the world seeing beyond the self in the world innocence dissolving the self and the world's sensory experience. On one hand. And improving the self in the world. Improving our individual lives improving the situation of humanity. And it's about the complementary relationship of those 2. So as we As we leave the retreat it's good to keep that in mind. We've been mostly doing sada, not work on ourselves for ourselves. Now we're going to go out into the world I just talked about continuing your sod in awe. But. We move more towards the surface position as soon as we leave a retreat service in what sense well at least in the subtle sense. You remember last night. I was saying that the positive changes in our affect. Which is more positive feel OK? And the the tranquility. And Energi. Which is the restful States and the flow that come about through doing this practice within us? That get People pick up on that all be, it, perhaps subliminally. But. Just walking through the world, you purify the land. They say the Bodie Sodfa creates a pure land land in the sense of environment, the whole environment, including the beings in the environment. So the you will certainly take the effects of this practice with you. And just walking through the world just interacting with People at the airport or. People you pass on the street. That's a service that you're doing automatically and effortlessly. Then there's all the other forms of service. Including the explicit service of. Uh. Helping the conditional happiness of People. When we go out into the world we could be doing that. And then We can help the unconditional happiness of the world first by that subtle enerji that we put out of joy. Tranquility and the flow of nature flowing through US. Perceptible to others. And then by describing this practice to People, you can all do that. And some of you by teaching this practice in an explicit way so I'm leaving a retreat. It's good to remember that all of us are teachers at at least one of these levels so we're going out to teach.","title":"What to Expect and Do After a Mindfulness Retreat"},{"location":"expandcontract/which-teachers-have-influenced-how-you-teach/","text":"Someone wrote in wanting to know. What teachers had influenced me and? What sorts of? Things I had in my background that have informed the way that I teach meditation. There's an interesting story about Sir Isaac Newton. He in some ways could be looked upon as. The key figure in the history of Western science innocence. Although science of course, had a long history before him things really took off after he published his mathematical principles of natural philosophy where he was able to link a new kind of mathematics calculus to a description of the natural world. This caused a revolution and it was recognized in his lifetime. How extraordinary his contribution was now this was a kind of quantum leap. Beyond anything that had occured before and indeed it did. Sort of. Create the soil fertile soil from which modern science has. Roll. So he was praised a lot in his lifetime. And he would on occasion say, well, if I have seen further than other People. It's because I stood on the shoulders of Giants. He was referring to People like Kepler Galileo converted phys and so forth. As a teacher, I don't know if I've seen further than any other teacher. But I can say for sure that I have been privileged to stand on the shoulders of Giants. On one hand. I have. The. Spiritual teachers that have influenced me. The strongest influences are. From a man named Joe Shoe Sasaki Roshi, who is at Mount Baldy, Zen center, then associated with him for. Oh. Over 2 decades now well over 2 decades. You can find him very easily on the Internet. He is arguably at this point at the age of 102 and still going strong. The Senior Living Buddhist master in the world. That's been a big influence on me. Although I don't in any way think of myself as teaching within the Zen Linneage. He was the senior teacher available to me when I was living in Los Angeles. When I come back from Asia and even though I'd have many, many years of practice. When I came back, I knew I still needed somebody with vastly more practice to kick me in the butt and inspire mean keeping on track so associated with him even though. That way of practice Rinzai Zen koan practice is not really to my personal proclivity. But in any event I needed the contact with somebody like that. So I don't teach in SM way, but I would say that his paradigm his model for how consciousness works. Is has had a profound influence on his paradigm is essentially a reworking of the notion of impermanence as it was formulated centrally in early Buddhism is rework that into a vastly larger than more general. Model for the nature of consciousness. At the name of this channel is based on. The name of his approach, it's all based on seeing impermanence in terms of expansion and contraction. So that's one huge influence a second influence on me has been through the personal tradition. The mindfulness tradition in specific have been influenced by 2:00 lineages of re personal practice, both come from 20th century, Burma. One is the Uber Kinlin Edge, which puts an enormous emphasis on body sensation. And I also emphasized body sensation not to the exclusion of other things. But just understanding how important body sensation is was something that I picked up from that tradition. So that's an influence, another influence is from the Mahaffey sad en linea age of Burmese V custom. I took from that the noting process. However, I have modified the concept of noting and the implementation of noting I've changed it somewhat from the way that it is done in the traditional Mahasen method. And I don't have time now to go into the details of that, but that has been an influence. Because most of the techniques that I teach involve noting sensory phenomenon. I've also been influenced by my original School of Ordination Bud Rihanna in the Japanese form, which is called Xinggan in Vajrayana practice. They put a lot of emphasis on. Visual experience auditory experience in somatic experience. You'll sometimes see the front of the expression body speech mind well body. His body speeches auditory and mind refers to mental images in this case that particular work. It's used refers to the visualization process that somatic visual auditory way of working both with. Subjective experience of object of experience that's something I picked up from the battery on a tradition so I stand on the back of these various Masters. Stand on their shoulders. I also further back stand on the shoulders of the prehistoric show monic explorers of consciousness whose names we don't know, but Who is rituals and ceremonies ordeals led to them entering states of concentration and equanimity? Which eventually developed? When Civilizations arose into the meditation techniques of these various lineages. But I'm fortunate to stand also on the shoulders of Sir Isaac Newton. And Euclid. Anne Francis Bacon. And Richard Feynman and Albert Einstein. And James Clark Maxwell. The whole science tradition, the whole western mathematical empirical rigorous sceptical pregnant pragmatism has profoundly influenced me the way that I teach. Is? Eh. My best attempt at a fully contemporary fully modern. And as close to science as can be at this point in history. Version. Of what that other linneage of Masters and prehistoric shamans. Had developed. So I get to stand on 2 sets of immense shoulders and I am immensely immensely grateful.","title":"Which teachers have influenced how you teach"},{"location":"expandcontract/why-meditate/","text":"Meditation optimizes 5 fundamental dimensions of human happiness. The first dimension is reducing suffering. The ability to experience unavoidable pain. With less. Problem. The second is elevation of fulfillment the ability to experience even small pleasures with enormous satisfaction. The 3rd dimension where my meditation impacts is self understanding. It's actually helpful to understand yourself at a psychological level, but where meditation really shines is to understand who you are at the deepest level. The 4th dimension is meditation will help you make object. If changes in behavior so if there's something you're doing that. You need to stop doing or something you should be doing that, you're procrastinating or pudding off you can use meditation skills. To behave, More skillfully in the world. Reduce suffering elevate fulfillment understand yourself at all levels, including the deepest. Improve behavior. And ultimately. To find within yourself a spirit of? Serving. Or contributing to the happiness of others. That comes from a spontaneous love. And actually that spirit of love and service is a concequence of success in the other 4 dimensions. As you suffer less or more fulfilled as you understand who you are, and as you have a handle on changing how you carry yourself. All of that sums up ultimately in how you contribute to making this world a better place.","title":"Why Meditate"},{"location":"expandcontract/working-through-the-primal-feel-strata/","text":"As you know, I like to have people be sensitive to the fact that certain body sensations are emotional in origin. And, I have a hypothesis that when people are noting those emotional Feel's that in fact, what's happening in the central nervous system is activation and what's called the limbic system and that there is distinct neuronal apparatus that underlies the emotional type sensations in the body. And emotional sensations in the body are hugely important in my way of thinking in terms of their influence on human perception and behavior. So, as people work with this category of the emotional body or Feel space as I call it, you might think well as the result of meditating as the years go on, things get sort of mellowed out, cooled out, that kind of thing. But actually what happens... typically is that you get strange changes that are sort of weird for people. And, they take the form of things that would really, really, really bother anyone, like, don't bother you or not much. But the flip side is that little things can cause these huge explosions of somatic emotionality. And you wonder like what's wrong with me? What's like sort of happening to me? So what I tell people is, if you work with the emotional body, one thing that you can expect is that things will change. But you can't predict what direction that change will take in terms of: are things going to be more mellow, more intense? Are the flavors that come up going to be more appropriate or inappropriate. They seem to go through wild fluctuations and it's important not to freak out when this happens and wonder what in the world is going on? I would say there are some things that we can say are long term trends. Absolutely definitely long-term trend. Uncomfortable sensations are going to become less problematic for you. And absolutely long-term trend, Ppleasant emotional sensations are going to become more fulfilling for you. However, in terms of local fluctuations, don't be surprised if there's some really weird chaotic kinds of things. What to do if that happens is, simply, recycle the reactions. The model that I like to use is that we have within us this freaked out infant animal deep down within. As we meditate we develop another self, which could be called the meditator self or the concentrated clear equanimous self, or the witness and at a certain extreme, we'll call that the no-self, or the higher self. So what happens is thatthis super adult part of us shines its attention on the freaked out infantile animal part that remains and integrates, or we could say even metabolise, or if we wanted to be a little more poetic, we can say eats up, literally nibbles away at the freaking animal infant within. And as this higher self or no-self or meditator self, as it's sort of like nibbling away at this freaked out infant animal, it's deriving nutrition from that. It's growing. Which is good And the freaked out animal infant is shrinking. Which is also good. Except, as it shrinks, it drops to even more primitive levels. OK. And that's why you get this weird sort of like: Oh my God, what do I have inside of me kind of thing. So, it's actually a sign of progress. The surface of freaked out animal infant, it's like getting integrated. Its energy, what the energy bound up in it is going into the super adult. That's good, but you sort of like nibble nibble away a layer, so it shrinks it smaller in a sense its influence over you is diminished, but it exposes a more primitive stratum. And so it goes until you sort of work your way through this aspect which might take a while. So as you get closer and closer and closer to becoming completely free, you are now exposing more and more and more chaotic intense levels of pure body emotion. So, this model helps me to have a conceptual framework for why it sometimes seems that that tiniest idiosyncracies of a person, our sins, crying out to heaven for vengeance or why someone can insult me with all kinds of lies on the Internet and I don't even give it a second thought. But, if somebody cuts me off in traffic, it's like this huge, you know, it's like you know, like I'm going to kill him, you know. So, it's like weird, ok. That seems to just be the way it works. I just wanted to share that for those of you that are wondering if you're on the way to the booby hatch. No, you're on the way to the Source. But as they say membership has its price. So you're joining the club. Many, many, many human beings have taken this path so, welcome to the club. But, membership has its price.","title":"Working Through the Primal Feel Strata"},{"location":"expandcontract/working-with-shinzen-s-algorithm-cross-chart/","text":"We have 4 themes that are in the rectal linear configurations. So you work with your ordinary states. Physical emotional sensations, external sites external sounds internal mental pictures internal talk. So that's a whole. The whole approach. Bull semen no touch sight sound feel in its abbreviated in there. We also have a way of. Enjoying restful states. So. We you can note the corresponding restful states physical relaxation and so forth relaxation light silence peace plan quiet. You can start there, you can start there actually you can start anywhere. Now we've got. Explorer dynamic states so you can not flow you could not vanishings. There's another way to work with restful experience. Which is the do nothing? Scott like 4 themes, but there's actually 6 procedures each of which has various versions as you'll remember. So you can start anywhere you can go anywhere. Well, one way you might use it is, you just pick. One technique 1 version and that's all you're going to do. In that case this represents. A Sears Roebuck catalog of spiritual spiritual practices and you decide to make 1 Purchas. And that's it. So maybe maybe you like noting restful state so that's what you do and you don't worry about all this other stuff. Another way to go about it is. Well, you like several of them and you arrange them in a workout sequence for yourself, like a Nautilus cycle. Each one of these is a piece of workout equipment. Now, those of you that were in the PM group process today. I gave you up I gave you the full Psycho Spiritual Nautilus Cycle. We started by noting ordinary states. Sort of like OK, we started the course level of ordinary experience. Untangle. Then we OK, let's note the corresponding restful states thinned out little more pleasant. 'Cause we're a little more settled now OK now there's could be flow. In the ordinary or the restful so we know the flow, then we not noted vanishings, now we've got quite a momentum. So if we do nothing there's likelihood that they'll be concentration clarity equanimity. Even though we're not trying to make it be there and indeed even a likelihood that they'll be quite a bit of rest fullness and Energie even though we're not in any way intentionally doing anything. So we sort of like OK. This is what in Catholicism would be called infused contemplation or passive contemplation. You're not doing anything anymore, letting this source do you? And that should take you into that and where do you go from that? From where do you go after crucifixion only one place resurrection? So you reanimate in a more positive way by a focus on positive now. You could start back here again right. It's a cycle if you come back here. Now you just noting what is but because you've been through this whole thing? What is is probably a little better than what it was an hour ago? OK and then you just cycle around OK and cycle rounded cycle around and it hits all the Psycho spiritual muscle groups. So the one I just. Showed went Ordinary rest. Flow banishing do nothing positive and then you can go back to order. This was designed to. Make it easy for. A person to interactively guide you. Once you have internalize these categories. If something comes up in the real world that. Blows you away. All you gotta do is call me or any facilitator that I've trained in this system and you will be back on track. Lickity split. I mean within 1/2 an hour. I don't care. How big it is I mean, I don't care. How big it is this gives a standard vocabulary. That a facilitator can be there to remind you most of us are not going to do the monastery thing. So. How are you going to get the industrial strength? Experience is that People. Get when they expose themselves to the intensity of traditional monastic practice. How you're going to get it is OK, you're not going to go to a monastery? But is the monastery going to come to you, you bet. You'll have an injury will have an illness you'll have. Something happened. You'll be betrayed. You will betray you. Will be mugged stuff is going to happen. Stuff is going to happen. When it happens. That's a monastery. If you know how to use it as a monastery, but there's maybe a little hard to remember that, you can do that. And it may be quite hard to remember exactly how to do that. On your own. But if you call me or someone like me. And if you're already familiar with this system. We can get you on track very quickly. I do it everyday People call me. You know, I just got mugged in la at gunpoint adjust my son. Just got arrested my best friend just committed suicide. And. You know, OK, so they have to talk about a little bit and then we get down to work. And. That person. Is now in as intense a training situation as anybody ever put themselves through? In the name of practice. And because there's an external person leading them through their able to get. Profound. Permanent. Growth out of that, so that's why I created this thing to be. Something that you could sort of internalize or you could internalize that is optimal for an algorithm approach to optimize your experience that you might not be remember how to do. But. Eh. Professionally trained facilitator does know how to do. And will take you through. And that's how it works so. Use let's say you start with ordinary states well. Maybe there's a lot of flow. Or maybe there's a lot of banishing so let's explore that or maybe? You start with restful states you want to start there and things get pretty restful so OK. Now let's drop the effort in let's do nothing. And then well where to go from here well natural place to go from nothing. Whatsoever is to a new good something etc, etc. So you Lupin Branch. You can start anywhere, depending on what comes up. So another way that you can use this is to sort of loop and branch that makes it more complicated. Don't have to do that, but it gives you flexibility. That and that gives you the ability to. Optimally deal with. Both windows of opportunity and Walls that make challenge. If you even if you don't use it as a looping and branching optimizing algorithm. When something comes up in your life. And you call for an interactive guided session and now OK. We're going to take this catastrophe. E and we're going to make it into your monastery. This is how will work. I'll take you through the algorithm an with a lot more bells and whistles that are on here. 'cause I've got all these special exercises. If the standard stuff doesn't work my looping and branching. Algorithm is huge so you sort of Doc your little computer program inside my huge computer program or one of my facilitators and we optimize your experience and then you're going to be able to get that maximum Psycho spiritual growth out of the do, do. Of of life.","title":"Working with Shinzen's Algorithm 'Cross' Chart"},{"location":"expandcontract/working-with-the-agitation-flavor-in-meditation/","text":"Sometimes, when we do meditation practice, we experience calm and tranquil, states but sometimes when we do meditation practice, we experience agitation impatience restlessness and so forth. There is a tendency to think when that kind of thing arises that I'm doing something wrong, but it's not OK. I would say that not only is it OK, but actually it's quite natural. I'm experience of restlessness in the body is a certain flavor of emotional experience in the body. I use the word feel to refer to body sensations that seemed to a person at a given time to be emotionally nature and I have a sort of list of common flavors of field that come up for People, the biggest uncomfortable ones are anger fear sadness. Shame slash embarrassment. But right after the Big 4. Comes what I call agitation or impatience. Now it may not be dramatic like anger fear sadness and shame. But the Don't want to sit still antsy kind of feel is very significant because it informs the day-to-day life of everyone. Most People are. Hopefully not living on a day-to-day basis, with rage tear grief and shame flavors in their body. But almost everyone experiences usually below the threshold of awareness a kind of. Subtle agitation impatience quality in day-to-day life. That's what given gives that sense of being driven and frenetic that inability to stop on a dime. Is primarily due to agitation flavors that sort of driving? Now, therefore is the goal to get rid of those agitation flavors. Well, no, I wouldn't really say quite that the goal is to be able to have a complete experience of those agitation flavors. What do I mean by a complete experience I mean that you experience it with an extraordinary degree of concentration censored clarity and equanimity. These are technical terms within the basic mindfulness system. But I teach and I've defined them. Elsewhere, when you bring enough concentration clarity and equanimity to any ordinary experience. It becomes utterly extraordinary. And that includes negative experiences uncomfortable experiences like agitation flavor in your body. It's desirable to be able to have a complete experience of the agitation flavor. That doesn't mean however, that you necessarily have to. Work with it. When it comes up. You may choose to focus away from it. So you're practicing everything is sort of Common. Whatever let's say you're focusing I don't know you're focusing on your breath for example, your breath sensations. And all this agitation comes up. So what should I do. Well, one possibility is to just let it be there, but in the background. And you keep bringing your attention back to the breath. But you don't think it's a bad thing that it's there. You don't try to suppress it. You just don't intentionally focus on it, you just keep coming back to your object. Now I would say that you're not. Bringing concentration or sensory clarity to the agitation. But you are bringing equanimity to it, even though you're not focusing on it, you're letting it be in the background, you're coming back to the breath. So one strategy would be just let it be there understand it's a natural thing. You let it be in the background. You keep focusing on what you were focusing on another strategy is OK. Let's not turn away from it. Let's turn towards it. Then you would be bringing 3 things to it, you would be accepting it as a flavor in your body, so that's the equanimity piece, but you were doing that before hopefully. That was already helping a little bit, but now you're bringing concentration and sensory clarity, you're intentionally focusing on it, and ignoring other things. And you are trying to be aware of the locations the changing intensities and so forth. And as a result of that that agitation flavor will cause you less and less suffering. And as it causes you less and less suffering. It will less and less drive. Your behavior in day-to-day life in general when a challenge comes up. One has the option to either turn towards it. And work with it as an object to focus or one has the option to just let it be in the background and stay with what you originally doing you can learn something for both ways of working and I usually encourage People to explore both possibilities that gives you flexibility the price of flexibility, though, is complexity. I mentioned that one of the. Weak points of my approach to meditation practices that I give People a lot of options that also could be taken as a strong point of course, so I give People ways of turning their attention away from challenges onto restful states or positive states or the energie flow of the experience and so forth, but I also give People ways of bringing their attention. Towards the challenge and accepting it as an object, perhaps solidified uncomfortable objectified but you're opening to it, turning the attention towards the challenge if when you're practicing the agitation flavor comes up. It's certainly not a problem. It's certainly OK. In fact, it's totally natural that that's going to happen. From time to time? What to do about it well. There's a lot of things you could do and they're all good which should you do should you turn towards it. Should you turn away from it. Well, I would say it's desirable to have the ability to do other approach because both are legitimate and both are productive.","title":"Working with the agitation flavor in meditation"},{"location":"expandcontract/zen-ox-herding-pics-part-1-of-3/","text":"The Chan or Zen School.

And it's called the 10 Oxherding Pictures surely out in Mandarin pronunciations, you use in the sino Japanese? Neo means an ox. And the ox symbolizes. The nature of consciousness. So they call it the Shinyo OK, the ox of consciousness, the consciousness symbolized by the ox. But to understand consciousness. In other words, experience our senses. Is also enlightenment so the 10 oxherding pictures can be interpreted in 2 different ways. One is they show you stages on the path to enlightenment. The other is they show you the process of. Uh. Understanding or truly grasping, Watt consciousness is but of course, those are exactly the same thing. I would like to go through them. I don't know if you can all see this, but this is the first picture. And this is called searching for the ox. Notice that there is no ox to be found. The Chinese verse that goes with this says the Oxherding Boy is completely lossed. There's no trace of the ox. There's only the cicadas chirping do you understand who the oxherding boy? Is and what the cicadas chirping? This is the situation of most People on this planet at this time, Unfortunately. They know they want something. But what they think they want.

They haven't experienced enlightenment. But something gives them an indication that. There is this possibility. Maybe they heard a Dharma talk. Maybe they had some experience when they were little that they never forgot. Or when they were grown up. Maybe they had a friend that came to a retreat. Etc etc. They get some indication. That there's Another possibility. Beyond the Trenchant fulfillment of the twittering world. So this is called seeing the footprints. Everyone of you has seen the footprints. Or you wouldn't be here. You might guess what the next step is. He sees the tail on the ox, the tush. And a few hairs of the tail. Hasn't really seen the whole ox yet? But can you see, there's the tush and the tail and it's like Oh my God, it really exists. I haven't seen it all but I have seen a little piece of it. Most of you are at least in this category. You've gone beyond. Just seeing the footprints OK, you've actually gotten a little visage of who you really are. Or you wouldn't have survived 2 weeks. In silence. So you seen the ox. But that's not. The same at all catching the ox. You see, he's got he's got the whole locks. And he's got a hold of it. Now we could. Say that this would be. Perhaps ones first glimpse of no self. Stream entry or kensho type experience. You've actually seen the whole locks. The nature of consciousness, which is. No thingness. And you got a handle on it. But it's still running wild.

Quite relaxed. But he's looking the other way. Is writing the ox backwards? Do you understand? There's no informed consent to enlightenment. Enlightenment is better than you think it is, and not nearly what is cracked up to be? Which one of those did you want to hear? Both or one both or neither. Enlightenment is like is like continually falling off a Cliff and being completely comfortable with that. A great and powerful. Beast carries you. And you have to give up. Your investment. With where it's going. It's the Ultimate Act of surrender writing the ox backwards. The flow of impermanence. You fall. It's like falling down but you don't fall down you fall up into existence moment by moment, which is what pro teach us. Some would Potter means it's a falling but a falling up. Without any fixation without needing to know. What's going to happen next you simply fall into? What needs to be done moment by moment? So this might be called the act of true faith. As opposed to belief. Which is holding on to something? Faith. Is? Letting go of the need to be oriented. The need to have answers. This is surrendering to the flow of expansion and contraction. Writing writing on the wave. Of. The dynamic wave of nothing whatsoever, Nahs. And letting it carry you. So that's quite a profound active. Faith what comes next. The ox. Has now carried you home he's home? OK. And he's completely. At rest. He's found final repose of the spirit. In his home. And the ox. Is gone? Only who he really was remains. Just the person. That. True authentic human with no fixated position whatsoever. And. No more need. For a mind as an object. He's home. He rode the ox home. Complete enlightenment. Nirvana. But there's 3 more pictures. What could they possibly stand for? Well, if you read the books. They give you various. Explanations. But uhm. I was privileged to. Discuss these pictures with a Japanese Zen Master, many years ago. Who told me that there is an oral tradition? About these 10 pictures. That has not been written down. That really it ends here. This is complete enlightenment this is final repose. Pictures 89 and 10 represent. The substance. Form. And purpose of enlightenment. Substance in Chinese is called T. Which literally means? Body. Are the form? Let's call Sean which is just that the form or the appearance and then what it's good for what it's used for is young and that's the application or they use. So T Sean Young, according to this row, she's oral tradition. The last three of these oxherding pictures. Uh tell us. The substance. The appearance. And the ultimate use of enlightenment. So you can hardly wait right. Substances coming up first. What is made out of the matter? The matter itself. And here is the substance of enlightenment. No substance whatsoever. Right. When the emperor *** Bodhi Dharma. What is the first principle of holiness? What did Bodhi Dharma say wide open an nothing holy? What's the form of enlightenment?

What is it going to be about? This is my favorite and the last. Essentia Lee, the Chinese version of Santa Claus. Roly Poly Guy, the bag full of goodies. Going into the marketplace handed him out. There anyone who wants to take him. Very ordinary OK. The kind of person you wouldn't hesitate to talk to. The kind of person you might not think. Even. Was in any way special unless you knew what to look for? This is actually a historical character. Someone that existed in Chinese history. He was known as the cloth bag monk. And that's essentially what he was a bag man, a street person in the capital of China. During the Tang Dynasty in China, there was this well known sort of St person. That was a kind of Buddhist monk. But all he did was play with children all day. And just hang out in the market Payson schmooze with People. And everybody knew him and he was just sort of this like friendly guy and. You know easy to get along with you never really think there was anything all that special. But it was always just sort of around for People. Particularly, like to give out. Gifts to children things like that, and at night, he used to sleep in the snow. Uh. That should have been a giveaway right there that there was something. A little unusual about his Physiology that may have been the result of. Of something he was known to the citizens of chang'an, and they called him the boot. I harsh on booming's cloth. Diamonds bag and Hushang means among the cough bag Monk 'cause. He carried around these gifts to give to People. The Emperor of China at that time was a Buddhist and meditator. Who had his own Imperial preceptor his own sort of master right would have been like the most authoritative? Monk in China of the time they call that the gouache are that's the the teacher of the emperor so one morning, the gotur. Said your Majesty. I don't know. If you're aware or not, but the most enlightened. Subject in your Kingdom died this morning. And the Emperor said, who And the Imperial Master said. The cloth bag monk. The Emperor couldn't believe it. Brazil's like that was the most enlightened person. In my Kingdom. 'Cause everybody just took him for granted. So this becomes. A sort of ideal for what an enlightened person should be like. Very. Ordinary very easily approachable just there therefore you. Nothing all that special in the Indic Formulation. Unenlightened. Being is a God. Is an archetype? But in the Chinese formulation. The enlightened being is. A sort of. Pudgy. Easily approach. Guy hanging out in the streets. Available to People. Uh but with these gifts to give. So this is called? This last picture is called entering the marketplace with hand outstretched. We may start this path for various reasons. But if we stay on it. In the end. This is where we end up. We end up with what's called the Dow Shin in Chinese, the Bodhichitta. The intense. Call to be of service to our fellow being in one way beings. In one way or another. It's an automatic consequense of. Having. Understood the nature of consciousness, the nature of. My mind. Which is the nature of nature the nature of the source it's an automatic consequense of? Knowing that your source is everyone source, but knowing that for real not in a sort of. Feel good belief kind of way. But in a very tangible way moment by moment really inescapable in your moment by moment perceptions of things. We're going to be going into the marketplace. When we leave here. Metaphorically. We have a bag full of goodies. And we can go with hand outstretched. Not that we're going to lay any trips on anybody. But. You have a gift to give. The gift of the effects of your practice. You may never speak about it explicitly but your pores will. The pores of your skin that's teaching. That's going into the marketplace, giving a gift to People. If somebody asks you what you did, in your capable of giving. A reasonable logical code coherent description of this practice. You're giving a gift. To someone. And some of you. Already and many of you eventually will discover that. You will end up actually teaching maybe 1 or 2 People. Or maybe more People, you may have heard the. The cliche when the students ready the teacher appears. Well, I don't know about that, but I can definitely tell you that when the teachers ready, the students appear. And you may notice that happening. To you. Do not be alarmed. And understand that in the end. Uh. This is the. The final goal of this practice.","title":"Zen Ox-Herding Pics - Part 3 of 3"},{"location":"expandcontract/zen-vipassana-becoming-impermanence/","text":"Impermanence is not just. Eh. Characteristic of sensory experience. Impermanence is a kind of Energe. That is. A vital Energi that you can learn to ride up In other words, impermanence is cheap. And so. The idea in the Zen style of experiencing impermanence is yes, it's the same deconstructive thing I described. But then you're also interested not just in form is emptiness. But you're very interested in how emptiness becomes form moment by moment. Briand yashma iron to use the Hebrew Kabbalistic term? How there's a rising of something from nothing well. The nothing repolarize is into this kind of Energe and in then they want you to ride on that enerji not just to observe impermanence as an object, but to literally become impermanence and there is a kind of bouncy springy. Vitality to the experience of emptiness as it is. Encouraged in the Zen tradition and that was fostered by a certain. Rhythm of practice. If you've ever been to Zen retreats where you're never allowed to fixate in repulsing that we move so slow that you disappear. In then you move so fast that you disappear. And that the idea is that that. Your I would almost say all those may sound a little bit inscrutable that. In mindfulness practice. You first. Observe impermanence. And then down the line hopefully. You'll learn to ride on impermanence. In live it, I have it animates you that, but in Zen, the style of the monastery the style of the training. With its spontaneity and it's Demand to perform without thinking. What that does is that causes you to ride on impermanence and if you live in permanents? In that lifestyle. Then eventually you'll be able to see impermanence in your sensory experience. It's almost like they approach the same issue from opposite directions. So then it has a kind of bouncy vitality to it, and a kind of claw or creativity that is. Characteristic of it, sometimes the Hinayana form of Buddhism that be personal. It's sort of like prosaic an sort of like I don't know lowkey. And. Doll and boring, but it's like a good it gets the job done. It's like a carefully crafted essay, but Zen stylistically is like an energetic pole. So. It's a whole different style of Enlightenment, a whole different expression of enlightenment. Yet it's the same enlightenment.","title":"Zen, Vipassana, & Becoming Impermanence"},{"location":"expandcontract/zero-and-one-part-1/","text":"What is interesting about zero and one? Is that? They are two of the main paradigms that have been used historically to describe the mystical path. The contemplative path. The path to enlightenment. In some traditions. It's described in terms of a oneness experience. That's very common around the planet and in some traditions. It's described in terms of a kind of 0 or emptiness the. Word in Sanskrit. For the number 0. Is shonia or shunyata? Which is also the word in Buddhism? Which for the emptiness emptiness as the source emptiness as the nature of sensory experience, so the same words are used the very same. Sanskrit word the bigger an experience is for us. The more overwhelming and experience is for us. Is just a measure of how large the polarization the splitting of the zero of the source? How far it has split? How much time space volume and how much sensory intensity has been born in between that polarization and if we can have a complete experience of such a large polarization the zero that comes. When there is a reuniting which inevitably happens for us will be a deeper purification a deeper enlightenment. Then, for a small challenge you might say. The one could be looked upon as. One is any size you want is one. Uh. Alternatively, you could say that one is. The combined effect of all canceling stretches and squeezes OK multiply by 3:00 and divided by 3:00. That's one. One kind of polarization. Few multiply by 1000 / 1000. That's another kind of expensive contractive stretch squeeze polarization so they play analogous rolls if we think of nature as being capable of. Creating distinction. And and Wiping away distinction if that's in some way of fundamental activity of nature. Then that would be reflected in our consciousness. Certainly. If we are able to fully give ourselves to the forces of division the forces that. Pull to the right pull to the left that stretch. It this way that squeeze this way. If we fully give ourselves to those forces. Then there's nothing to get in the way of the neutralization. The coming back and if you want to think of it as coming back to a Oneness. You can or if you want to think about as coming back to 0 neus you can also do it that way so. Let's talk about the experience of Oneness in the sense in some of its guises we might speak of. The. Alienation of thought and feeling. And. We could then speak of the healing of that alienation. And a unification. Of thought and feeling thought arises through. Either visual thinking auditory, thinking or both at the same time. And emotionality arises through the limbic system in the brain, which causes. Affect if so much thesia nice fancy way of saying body sensations that seem emotional. If you pay attention to what happens when you experience anger fear sadness embarrassment impatience discussed interest joy. Love gratitude humor smile, etc, etc. These have flavors in the body there. Initially, maybe nebulous, but eventually there just as distinct as hot or cold. The Soma, the body can be trained into emotional high resolution screen. There's no official word for body sensations that seem emotional in nature, so I call it Watt. Feel just have a word, and notice. I say feel not feeling 'cause feeling has a gazillion connotation. So I sort of made an unusual noun using feel as a noun? To point out that it's a technical term within this system so we have the body sensations that seem that are emotional in nature to us. We have mental images in internal talk now when you have a complete experience of feel image talk. You are too busy experiencing it, too fixated. A complete experience is an experience where there is an extraordinary degree of concentration clarity and equanimity. So to all coming together, we can't always have all three of these facts. Sometimes we can't have any of these. You may have noticed. We can't always have all 3. When all 3 do come together at a certain critical mass than ordinary experience becomes utterly extraordinary, an my word for ordinary experience that has become utterly extraordinary is a complete experience. Now it's a technical term, though I don't need complete in the sense. It was intense. I don't mean complete in the sense that I don't know you stayed with it to the end. That's part of it. By complete I mean that there was a certain critical mass of concentration clarity and equanimity present from beginning to end in that experience that constitutes what I technically call a complete or full experience. We can't always have complete experiences, but sometimes we can and with practice. We can have it more and more and more. And when we have a complete experience of something that's ordinary it's utterly extraordinary because it's utterly paradoxical, I read the Saint John of the cross poem to you lie noche to give you a flavor of how something could be sensorially rich. And yet also utterly transparent, and vacuous at the same time as a single experience. So ordinary experience becomes extraordinary in that it becomes both. Deeply fulfilling and no longer there. And therefore ordinary experience becomes extraordinary because it's paradoxical I just said what. Something that really doesn't make a whole lot of sense and I'm afraid many People would probably think is irrelevant to anything. Maybe they just think this is philosophical speculation or wordsmith 3. I'm sorry I have no choice. That's how you know when you start to have. Complete experiences you end up having to say this stuff whether you want to or not. One could also say that when you bring a certain critical mass of concentration clarity and equanimity to an ordinary experience. It becomes utterly extraordinary. You could also say when you bring an extraordinary degree of concentration clarity and equanimity to an extraordinary experience like a God manifesting fully in front of you. That experience becomes utterly ordinary. That's the path of liberation as opposed to the path of power.","title":"Zero and One - Part 1"},{"location":"expandcontract/zero-and-one-part-2-of-4/","text":"We can't always have enough concentration clarity and equanimity to have a complete experience of something. But maybe we can have a little bit of concentration. Or, a little bit of clarity or a little bit of equanimity. And that's not too shabby. Maybe we can hardly have. We can't have any concentration clarity and equanimity at all under certain circumstance but we can have equanimity with that. We can accept that that's the case and we can continue to. Do formal practice despite the fact that we have essentially no concentration. No clarity in all equanimity. However, we're still setting the stage for nature to do its job, where catalyzing a natural process. We're giving nature what it needs on the surface. It seems like we're wasting our time. Doing a formal practice because it's like total monkey mind total confusion mind total like lausten, emotional chaos sleepy. Aches and pains OK, it seems like we're wasting our time however. Deep down. Slowly changes are taking place, even under those circumstances because we're giving nature a chance. If you have a lot of concentration clarity and equanimity great you can explore the possibility of complete experience. But if you can't have concentration or clarity. Maybe you can have some equanimity. If you see what I'm saying there's always a way to look at it positively so if you can't have all three try to have one or 2 if you can't have any at all keep doing the formal practice. Um because that's still doing some good in the long term, so you can always go do? What seems like going through the motions. It's still better than just completely acquiescing to desperate and hopeless wretchedness, human condition. However, on occasion and certainly with practice. Given enough time enough time might be a lot of time folks OK, you'll start to get hints of an experience of sensory completeness. Where things get really extraordinary is when you can have a complete experience of feel image talk? All at once. That integrates. The mind and the emotions into a single arabesque of empty Energi. So there's a Oneness and nothingness there. The world of concept, and the world of emotion, which are often thought of as you know the head and the heart being separate OK, so they had in the heart literally are integrated that's the Oneness theme. OK, they're integrated by having a complete experience simultaneously of feel image talk so. Completely present in the moment that there's no. Time to fixate them and they manifest as a wave rather than a zep articulate thing called the cell. Or thing called? Thought and feeling. So that's quite an integration that's quite a theme of Oneness right there. But there can be a broader theme of Oneness. That would be the theme of integrating not just the head in the heart. But the mind and the whole body, not just the emotional body. But the physicality of the body touch space as I call it if feel is the emotional sensations. All the other sensations? What are we going to call them. The Itches and makes the pressures and pains the sleepiness sensations ordinary Physiology. The pulse etc. Etc hot and cold bladders full stomachs empty. All that sort of stuff. I call them touches whether they're on the surface or on the inside. Body is touched feel space well. There's a tradition in mindfulness practice. It's not a requirement that it's something that's done by some People sometimes it's very interesting. You can learn a lot from it. It's done in other traditions too. But in our tradition. It's called strong determination city. Edit Anna in the Pali language and it means you make a decision for a certain period of time. I'm not going to make any voluntary movement. Typically, it's a minimum of one hour, but I guess you know theoretically could be anything. One hour, 2 hours, 3 hours for half a day. Whatever you want to do I did a retreat once? In Australia was a 2 month retreat and it was great. It was like not I didn't have to run a retreat. I was taking a retreat for 2 months. Didn't have to do anything but meditate? And, of course I wanted to make optimal use of that time, the way the schedule work. There was this nice 4 hour slot. In the afternoon. So I decided the first day OK. For the next 2 months. I'll do a 4 hour strong determination sit during this slot see what happens you know what happens right. Edit aid pretty. What happens is that after about an hour you start to get some really significant pain? And then after about an hour and a half. Your you know your Gnashing your teeth in your Your hands are now a sweaty fist. And you know, then your body starts to shake uncontrollably and then. You're flooded with huge emotions of fear and mental confusion and distorted thinking Ida Shun and then start to lose control of your body your eyes start to go up into your head and you can feel like it's horrible really, really bad, however. It is, after all. Just a huge eruption of touch feel image talk, the will. The freak out is in feel image talk, the pain is in the touch.","title":"Zero and One - Part 2 of 4"},{"location":"expandcontract/zero-and-one-part-3-of-4/","text":"Divide and conquer time honored method work with each one individually. Go to talk space. I mean, it's just like going crazy. Rides just like no no no no no. No, you're crazy. You know you're going to hurt yourself. You don't have to do this. And so let's just talk work with that and images images of. Stabbing OK burning grinding torture you know it's like really those are just the rational images. There's then there's the the hell realms. The archetypal images, where you start to like like look into the depths of Hell and beings you see being tortured and tormented all over the planet and all sorts of archetypal really weird. And like former lives of having been tortured and you know it's just all but it's just image. Just image activity and then there's fear and rage and feel space and sad poor me. That's still the hardest one for me to deal with sort of deal with the fear and the anger stuff that sad for me that is so primitive. I remember that boy that's the first feel I remember as a little baby like pour me sad. So you get like the fear and the sad. At a kind of impatience late. An agitation don't want to sit still kind of flavor like an antsy when India Titias called Schpilkas. Yes, that's an inch focus. Yeah, those are you know the language means pins and needles kind of thing, so you've got like. You know three at least 3 on comfortable fields and you got this crazy things going on in image and talk and then you've got like the local and global pain right there's the local. Stab burn terror kind of stuff an you know it's like being site being beaten like it's being you get hit. You get like it a whole bunch of times pipe at my bank and then it just like ripples. The whole body of Bang Bang and then it goes Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang local and global right by bang and then it goes locally. Propagates through your body space and subtle is significant those little pings. They're not nearly as intense is the local punches. But actually that's where the bulk of the suffering is so work locally work globally work with in the touches zoom in zoom out sweep through it just throw everything I have at it and we're only to the three hour point there's another hour. The first time I did it. Towards the end of the 4 hours things started to break up a little bit. That's along I know that's like wow. That's a long time. But. Doing it day after day after day after day week after week after week after week, there was learning see it's not about how much you can endure. It's about how much you can learn from what you. Do indoor so just to somehow in do or something if you don't learn from it by learning I mean, your cells don't learn you. You know if you don't retrain the body. Then you just endured it. So it's better to go through something mild. And have a clear learning experience than it is to somehow you know soldier through in a macho vein and somehow well, I endured it but. If he didn't learn very much what's the point. If you learn, though it's worth it. So it's if I tell this telling this story. I'm realizing maybe it's not a good idea to tell stories like this, because People will think well. Gee if that's what you have to go through flu. I think I'll I'll take my enlightenment in a subsequent life. But. The issue is not what is not like OK, you're going to have to go through **** like this, if you want to get anywhere on this path that's not what I'm implying. The issue is what can you learn by the time I was up for 4 hours since I mean, I'd already had 20 years of meditation practice this isn't. Well, although actually when they started me in Japan. I had to go through things comparable, but not for 4 hours. Maybe a couple hours so I already had a lot of experience and had worked with these phenomena and so forth so as I say the important thing is what you learn learning is some of it is intellectual, but primarily it's retraining your touch feel image talk circuits, so that they learn not to fight with them selves because it's the fighting with this. It's the fixation around this that causes the suffering not the intensity. Of the touch feel image talk eruption. So anyway, what started to happen on a pretty regular basis. By you know a few after a few weeks of doing this every single day. Is that it would sort of reach reach a certain intensity at the midpoint and then? It would like really dramatically break up. It didn't just get worse and worse and worse and worse endlessly. You think it's going to get worse and worse, but it's sort of. It's an inverted parabolic thing OK. It's a goes up and then it like goes down. And what goes down is not the intensity of sensation that just goes up. What goes down is the suffering? When you have an intensity of sensation an no suffering you have a taste of purification so there's actually a positive in that. It's not just an absence of the suffering it's a presence of a kind of taste. I don't know how else to describe this. It's an awareness that because of how I'm experiencing this in this moment. Every moment of my life to come will be different. More fulfilling. And the Holdings that I have from the past are being broken up. It's A kind of knowing I can't put it into words. It's A kind of knowing. That the way that I'm experiencing this moment is cleaning out the past. And creating a brighter future. I call it the taste of purification. Once that taste of purification comes on you actually are getting a reward in this. And that's becomes a huge motivation to. Explore the edges of experience so. What eventually happened was? That was that. I came to know this territory, so intimately that as soon as I would sit down the pain would start at the same time. My thoughts would start and my emotions would start they'd all start at the same time. The. Talk image and feel reacting to the growing touch. And as soon as they would start. They would just flow together. They'd float together into an integrated arabesque of Energi. And as the pain got bigger and bigger and the thoughts and emotions arose more and more. It just got more and more and more integrated so there was not. And I. Not so much of an there was still some of something of a sense of an eye. Experiencing and it called pain, but not so much. Not so much as ordinarily be anyway. Let's put it that way. There was a oneness between my thoughts and emotions. Representing the I and the pain representing the IT. And. They. Were they float together? And gave this taste of purification.","title":"Zero and One - Part 3 of 4"},{"location":"expandcontract/zero-and-one-part-4-of-4/","text":"That came to represent for me. Are tangible experience of? Not just an integration of my thoughts and emotions, but the integration of my whole body mind self. So. I still don't like discomfort, OK, but I know now that whenever I have to face discomfort. It will lead eventually to the same experience I've come to expect that to happen on a regular basis eventually. And the experiences. That the entire body mind becomes unified and it's a really delicious experience anyway. That's Oneness, an even larger scale, so we can have the Oneness of the? Thoughts and emotions, but we can also have the Oneness of thoughts and. Emotions and the emotionality and the physicality of the body. So most People would define themselves as a body mind. Entity when you get body mind unified as flow. Then. That's That's an integration of yourself. But how about the outside world how about the world of sights and sounds. What I just described was a kind of other? The touch an myfile image talk, which is sort of. The perceiver. The IT of the touch and the me of the fit the feel image talk. Becoming a single flow. United when you have a complete experience of Sight. External seeing And at the same time. You have a complete experience of your thoughts and emotions about what you see. Then the exact same thing happens your I never fixates on the external side of the flower for example, here so. The flower is a flow of light of colored light. And the I looking at the flower is a flow of. Feel image taught colorations you might say. And those 2 flow together. And that gives a unification of inside and outside along this dimension. And. Even easier for most People is with sound that's probably why People like music, so much. Because they whether they know it or not they can have an experience of merging or Oneness with the music. But if you understand the sensory components. And how Allowing. Your thoughts and reactions to the music to arise without any interference so they just flow. There suffused with concentration clarity and equanimity so they become simply a flow of energy. And the music itself is relatively easy for People to experience that as a flow of energy the hard part is to experience the listener as a flow of energy. What I found interesting when I ask People about their experiences of music People that work meditators right? Lots of People talked about the music gives them a kind of Energe. And that means that although they don't quite have the categories clear and they don't quite realize the potential when they're having that kind of quote Enerji with the music. The music is beginning to cease being thing, and it's starting to become a flow. A doing now that that's that's the easy part, the hard part is. You're going to have thoughts and emotions that react to that music to experience them with constant so much concentration clarity that they flow. And. The music is also flowing so the music and the listener, literally become a single integrated arabesque of empty Energi. And if you can do it with music you can do it with ordinary sounds and if you could do it with ordinary sounds. You can do with annoying sounds like somebody breathing in the meditation Hall when they're not supposed to or your neighbors blasting the stereo or you have to room with somebody that snoring, etc, etc. So you have these various rageful reactions to the Sonic invasion. Well let's feel image talk and then there's the flow of the sun, it turns out that. Impermanence flow change. Is the Great Integrator? It integrates. The head and the heart. It integrates the mind and the body. It integrates the inside and the outside. It's a vacuous integration, though it's it's a one and a 0. At the same time. In addition to integrating the head and the heart. The mind and the body, the inside and the outside. There's an even more awesome level of integration. We could say that broadly. Touch sight sound is it? And feel image talk is me. Broadly. So self and world. Can be integrated? But there's one more. Contrast. Deeper than the contrast between. I and it. Is the contrast between both of us? And the formless source In other words between creation and creator if we want to use a somewhat Western paradigm. When that connection becomes. Integrated. When there is one with the 0. Ultimate 0. That's the ultimate integration. That experience of. Living Nirvana.","title":"Zero and One - Part 4 of 4"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/1-working-with-intense-emotion-guided-stephanie-nash/","text":"OK, so you mentioned you wanted to work on some specific issues. Anything you'd like to just tell me briefly about those issues before we start to work in terms of what it is, and what your goals would be in working on it? Yeah. What I'm working with now is a strong? Feel component that has. You might call it touch. I sometimes called secondary field with that tension that comes around the field can lock into quite a dramatic degree when it first arose it seemed triggered by external event. But what I is a response and emotional response to an event. But I think it became clear that as I processed it that it kind of worked as a magnet to draw years. To? Who knows what other stuff up with it that matched that. Emotional frequency and then for awhile now several days. I've been working with it there. I let go of their having to be any talk image component an it's just a huge amount of Field Which. I have techniques and ability to process but it's. Quite a a significant event an I thought Ah time to call in the big guns. An I thought you could help me with this and maybe someone could benefit from it help. Let me ask some questions so I can make sure I understand the situation. Ann you're having a lot of emotional type body sensation. Not all feel right. But I think that you're saying that you have. A muscle tension reaction to that feel when it arises when I think there's a very, very strong field and because it is so non stop. An intense that the body just starts to tighten around it in a way that I'm working not only with the field. But I have to kind of work with the tightening that comes around it. And so I might work with one then work with the other, but there's no question the core. It's feel, and everything else is just because it bends so intense for so long. The bodies just starting to and I'm literally now experiencing physiological. Things in the body just simply from that tightening around the field does that make sense and so you want to work with this sensory phenomenon. The underlying emotional sensations or feel as we would put it in the technical vocabulary body sensation. That seems emotional and then there's a kind of physical response in the form of muscle tension an that muscle tension. Some People consider that to be a fit purely physical sensation. But because it's so linked with the emotions. Some People consider it to be and it to be in and of itself. An emotional sensation that we can parse it. Either way to bring on what's natural for that person. I have a few other questions to ask you it sounds to me like you've already been working with it in the way that I would be that I would consider optimal by that. I mean that you're sometimes focusing on the tension reaction, sometimes focusing on the underlying feel itself, which is the general strategy of dividing conquer so and I've been I've been using a lot of. Flow is probably where my natural strength is and so and I can work with flow and almost immediately have some kind of response to that of going into it, but then it's re arises in Rican deal. so I thought OK. I've gotta maybe more deeply or maybe you can just help me well probably the strategies that you are using? Are already optimal but that's my guess? It's simply a matter of continuing with them. But let's just do some interactive stuff and we'll see what comes up. I'm not sure that there's actually anything new to add content wise it may just be a numbers game of continuing what you're now doing but like I say, Let's see what happens do you have a couple more questions? Does the tension reaction that you're referring to? Does that? Tend to come up. In a pronounced pattern. In real time or is it more of an going sort of situation. By that I mean, is there a clear sense of they'll be an eruption of field and then there's a tension eruption of fuel. Then there's attention or is it that attention is sort of there. In a fairly on going way or does it tend to fluctuate moment by moment with the fluctuations in the feel a little bit of the second a little bit of 3rd that the field is pretty continuous pretty intense. But there is a rising and falling depending on if I'm able to give it. You know if I'm able to stop and go into it, sometimes it might multiplying effect times 10 and become quite. More than what you wanted to deal with that. I'm assuming that's a part of the process. Sometimes my work with it will help it flow. The tension does not correspond directly to the field and I've in what I'm calling the tension is just from the feel having been so consistent. There's a kind of uh not breathing in a tensing in its creating stuff in the back end. So it's not really a moment by moment tensing. Physical muscle tensing around emotional body sensation. It's more, the result that the emotional body. Sensations have been ongoing for so long that you're getting this secondary sensation. Yes, and there may be a settle other than from what I'm describing the thing that I'm aware of is then literally parts of my body start to hurt and I know it's just from the bot just getting tired. The body kind of getting tired from working with the school. Now let me ask some other questions. The. You talk about the field, breaking up into flow and I'm assuming that happens with some consistency. You know whenever I focus in on it. Yes, that that's about the tension reaction does it break up in the flow? If I'm focusing twords that yes, yes that can break up Ken Break up into flow, as well. They all do kind of. Like a rubber band snap back into place a lot. It just feels like. There's just been a momentum of break up into float, but then they can re solidify so you can actually have the tension. And the feel both turn into flow with your practice can you have you attempted to do that during? Practice in motion like walking minute practice is pretty much yes, I I have to otherwise I wouldn't be able to function. I wouldn't be doing this today, if I wasn't so you can already get them both to dissolve into flow, which is. Pretty but when I'm doing an action In other words, If I'm stopping and all of my awareness is going into that I can go total flow. But when I have to also do this activity or talk to this person or do something like that. All of my attention isn't on it, so there's some congealing. All you know, I can do enough flow to function, but I'm I'm not you know floating on clouds. All the way through I do have periods where something like there's certain activities that help the flow. If I'm when I'm doing a laughing meditation or or when I'm facilitating somebody. I literally don't. It pretty much all goes flow during certain activities. But the rest of the time. It's having to kind of keep some awareness there in somewhere in his hair just to kind of function.","title":"1. WORKING with INTENSE EMOTION guided Stephanie Nash"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/2-working-with-intense-emotion-works-with-stephanie-nash/","text":"Couple more questions. Is the? Which is? The source of the greatest distress is it the feel or the tension real feel absolutely so you're not so concerned with dealing with the tension well. That'll go when the field so the core issue is intensity of activation of emotional body sensation absolutely OK. That helps me hone in a little bit more on what are? Target right have you attempted? Well, I should say as you know a basic principle in mindfulness is divide and conquer case in point you have divided this experience into OK. There's the emotional body sensations. That's one component. Then there's the muscle reactions to those at the second component, so that's already a divide and conquer and that is already given you some relief that the average person wouldn't experience under comparable circumstances. As you remember a second axiom as if that, if divide and conquer doesn't work. Remember, what I always say subdivide until you do conquered in this case have you attempted to break the feel into specific flavors. Anger fear sadness In other words? Have you applied the noting feeling floating feeling flavor technique to this intense arising? Yes, I have? what I have found to be more helpful. Is the investigating? Where exactly I'm feeling what OK it's a clinching here? What are the boundaries? Is there more pressure in? Is it pushing out you know? am I coming up with a moron kind of investigating it without necessarily putting a label of the quality that that's been a little more successful in helping me go through it, the but I could tell you the quality the subdivide principle can be applied with regards to either the. Quality right which is the noting field flavors so that gives you the spectrum anger fear sadness interest. What have you. But the subdivide principle can also be applied to the spatial aspect of things. So then let's just let it go just could happen during a real session, so divide so you can subdivide into. Flavors but you can also subdivide into locations. So it's an application of the same principle. So you're saying that sub dividing it by individual body locations has turned out to be more productive your location and quality. Of sensation you mean so it's a little. Both yes, I'm over an location getting specific about. Those yeah, so you've already made the major thing that I would first try because you've internalised the algorithms and you say that that does help do you note the location like with the location word face now haven't been doing that out loud? Been tracking the location and then it sounds like you're staying up for a little. While in a location naming my awareness around inside of inventory kind of what it's like when I'm inside of it. It's so much easier than when I'm outside of it. For me well that. Once again sounds like pretty optimal strategy. Tell me what are the range of flavors involved it's primarily fear flavor primarily to a almost terror panic? Play sphere an intense fear and there's absolutely sadness. There's absolutely, yeah, is there any reason for it or is it just erupting in the box. I have like? I said I think there was an event or 2 that triggered it on the outside, but this was out of proportion of that and I saw that and as I kind of worked with it, I found that the particular story the surface story. I see I even knew is silly, but as as I let go of their needing to be a story. I kind of just went into this whole huge feel an as I've gone down in layers. I'm seeing kind of flickers of like Oh fear of annihilation that I'll be killed in any moment. There's not a logical right in other ways into this not really coming from the object of external. I think it taped. I think whatever this was on the outside hula fear tapped. Everything like a magnet, I think it drew everything up that resonated at that frequency and it's just kind of really throw me at how huge it is an or they say in Ohio huge use was a huge but really it's taken all my technique or skill to be functioning, so we're having a huge upwelling of. Uh. Fear potential an sounds like 7 and are they equally strong. The fear in the sadness. I'd say the fear is probably it's probably like. The fear is the cake in the sadness is icing that's also going down through the cake food analogy actually that's probably a pretty accurate description because that's what happens they tangle and interact. And you say very little mental image or internal talk accompanying this first. There was a lot. But as I go down. It's almost pure body? How 'bout very subtle image or talk activation set liminal that balance of something subliminal stuff is where that Annihilation came up that is starting to suggest some strategies. Let me ask you. Further I say annihilation, but the thing that comes up with big killed like like anybody at any moment could kill you know, an * but it's fear and this is good. You've heard me a million times talk about how before we break through. These things they need to become my phrases continuous and ubiquitous. Continuous means unbroken in time ubiquitous means everywhere in the body. And we have to going toys, if that's happening, yeah, then a process of. Permanent purification is happening so people of course. Are averse to the notion of letting something like fear sadness become continuous through time an Omni directional in the body ubiquitous through the body. But at that Penny Wise and pound foolish because being unwilling to pass through that temporarily keeps them. Always sort of Damocles of fear hanging over their head and likewise with the other negatives like sadness anger and so forth so. You have to reach a point where it's completely irrational completely over the Top intense. Doesn't stop in time and is in every cubic centimeter of your body if not of the known universe? You know In other words, perceived as larger than the body. And and say OK I would allow this to go on forever. It's at that point that you're getting optimal catharsis in the sense of cleaning out. So what it's taking awhile but I'm getting a clearer hearing you say that makes me feel better. You know, I mean, not I still work, but you know it's kind of just helpful to have somebody say, 'cause I've just been working on it by myself without talking when they want in that it's really helpful to hear it. But just helpful to hear that you know, yeah, I would say that this. This is the stage before People become free.","title":"2.

Plus, the still point. There is the dance of our humanity, which is A3 jobs. Appreciate self in world get over the self and world improve the self in the world. All right. Tools for doing those jobs are. Our attentional skills concentration sensory clarity equanimity. Those skills are applied to and cultivated within. Are visual auditory and somatic sensory experience? Here we have the dance of nature. From expansion contraction interplay in implied by Planck's constant at the very small level of things. This is the Friedman. Equation. Cosmic density. Which is the interplay of? Expensive matter and contractive metal expensive matter energean contracted matter Energi. That determine the ultimate size and shape of the universe and so forth. This stands for numerous structures in between the largest and the smallest that. Have. Can be looked upon as having expensive contractive? Enter play like a star is. Formed by the interplay of. The outwardly directed photon pressure from the heat and the inwardly directed force of self gravity, and numerous scales. We see this. So this is sort of the dance of expansion contraction contrast with in the material world or nature. And that's reflected by mutually canceling polarities within the mathematics of the complex number field. Which allows for addition? Scaling which is multiplication by a real real number and sort of Twirling, which is imaginary exponentiation or Fazer. This is the stretch squeeze aspect of generalized, multiplication and this is the turn to the right turn to the left, which called a Fazer. Fazer aspect of multiplication, which is the Twirling. And this is the. This is like a dancer that you know moves forward moves backwards stretches out pulls in toils to the right turns to the left so we have this abstract dance. Of the numbers. And we have the? The material the dance of nature itself. Time space matter and energy. And then we have our senses. And our sensory attention skills. Which allow us to do the human dance? This was put in a center in the center is the still point of the turning world. Which is the source? Of all of it. And this is. A way of. Summarizing in a modern way. What I would characterize as the pythagorean agenda? Pythagoras had this revolutionary idea lived around the same time that the book done did. I could be off by century or so, but roughly. You know, 5th 6th century BC that kind of thing. This revolutionary idea. Bet. The endeavor of the human soul. And. The nature of nature. And the nature of number or a single unity. And so. This is a modern way to think about. Um. I. Vindicating the pythagorean agenda. And down here 3 dances. 3 dances in the still quite. What sort of cool is that? The Pythagorean's. We're often represented. By the pentagram the 5:00 pointed star that's where this all comes from. So. This is all Maj to my. Ancestors already Israelites so we have. We have the The Greeks and the Semites all this 3 dances. 3 dancers at the still point of the turning world. Neither movement from North Taurids. At the still point there, the dances.

This is this is shifting the nature of my experience in a way I hadn't expected. Probably the first T moment. Came a few months into the practice. When I started to notice that at the end of our set. The Voice that had always been screaming in my head. Although it was still present it was like, at a distance. It wasn't screaming anymore. I didn't have to listen to it. Instantly I never experienced anything like that was like the internal talk by the end of a set the internal talk hadn't gone away. But he was like, at a distance who was muffled. That wasn't you know. Whole New World for me. So I went to my teacher and I said, my sitting scotting getting interesting and he said. Oh, in what way and I described this phenomenon. And he said Oh that's good, you're starting to go into Samadi. Into a state of high concentration. So. Then he said now you have anything that you experience on the cushion. You must eventually be able to experience in daily life. And I thought This is crazy. I could barely get a little heut of that quieting of internal talk. Um. After an hour of focusing on my breath? How can I possibly maintain this in daily life and he said. Well, you can just do it that was a pivotal experience that was really new and something that who would have ever thought. That was possible for someone like me to experience even a few moments of quiet of internal self talk. I would say the second dramatic thing that ever happened to me came. At the end of my first week long. Zen retreat in Japan, which was this * Riffic killer ordeal. It was in the summer very first night they like broke 3 sticks over People think the mosquitoes like an inch long that could bite you through your clothes. And it was like you know, Japan is very moist, so In summary you're just like sweating right. And you're not allowed to move at all. No matter what and by the way this is a good example of what I mean by horrifically bills that I would like People, not to have to go through by working smart with precise vocabulary. But. Because if we talk about this People say, Hey, you know who would ever put themselves in that they don't see themselves in that scenario. So you don't have to do this kind of thing, but the first time I did do. That kind of thing I buy the and I nearly had lost my marbles. I was starting to have insane ideations, literally insane thoughts. Like a torture victim basically and my whole body was shaking with pain and I thought I was going to cry. I was, I was sure I was just going to start bawling. And it was the last. Set of the last day. And I was just holding on and in my whole body was shaking and I was just holding on for dear life. And I realized I was about to cry, but not just crime, I mean ball breakdown. And I started to scream in my talk space. You're not a baby. Don't Cry. You're not a baby? Don't cry like that over and over again. And. Suddenly. For no reason. I dropped into equanimity. Big time. It wasn't just the quiet OK that I've described before my entire being dropped into a spontaneous equanimity. The way you know that's happened is the pain level is. Exactly the same but the suffering level. Dramatically. Reduces or perhaps even goes away. And in this particular instance. The suffering completely went away, so I went from. Near fainting level of pain. To my body totally relaxed. Yes, the internal talk turned off. And the pain turned to do a kind of flowing enerji that was just massage in my being. And it was like I could have stayed there forever. The physical body was literally breaking up into a flow of spirit. And. Then the Bell Rang. That ended that set. I was never the same because. You know you can hear somebody say this but. If you haven't experienced it. Why should you believe it and I would have never believed that that could be the case. So that was extremely dramatic a few years later, one day at the end of day, I sat down. I haven't meditated that day, I was doing self inquiry at that time. Asking, who am I. And at the end of the day, I sat down and I said, who am I. I looked at my boundaries. And they vanished. And they never came back. And I was tired, the same ever I didn't said I just got up. I got up I just started to walk around and communicate with the walls. And they were. Me. And so is the whole world. And next morning, you want to went to bed that night. I thought well that's going to go away, you know it's like. Woke up the next morning. It was there an it never went away ever my whole life, I was, I've been privileged. That was after I'd meditated for about. For years, so it's been 40 years now, so I like 3536 years ago. And it has nothing to do with Out concentrated your heart is just is. That was obviously huge watershed there that's what gives me the confidence to teach.","title":"3 Key Moments for Shinzen Young"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/3-things-shinzen-got-from-joshu-sasaki-roshi/","text":"I've heard you speak of enlightened Masters. An you spoke of Roshi is being a Masters master when you met him. And I've heard you tell stories of other teachers that you lived with in your encounters I've never heard you when you've talked about your influences of what's influenced your teaching. I've heard you talk about a new book, en linea. Dura has he say it all. Lenny it in terms of what they rotten, noting or body sensation or but the only teacher. I've heard you really speak a venue shift totaly when you talk about him is Roshi meeting Sasaki Grocery. Bro. She is a general title in Japanese for any mass any Zen Masters called of Roshi. But yes, Jones Shoes Sasaki * * Yes, if there are other light and Masters that might come into this conversation. We've that too. But my interest here would be to have you talk about what it's like to? Be in his presents and work with him and what having this man's. I don't know energy input into your life, but that is for you is a teacher because I don't know who else you go to? For your support. When I came back to the United States I. Realized I still needed a teacher, but I didn't have anybody that I could go to within the tradition. I wanted to work in which is the mindfulness tradition after I've been back here for a few years I was drawn to mindfulness because it could be extracted from the cultural million ready and the religious matrix of Buddhism and presented as a fully secular practice. And so that appealed to me and I like the systematic nature of mindfulness. But by the time that had happened that. I was probably the senior mindfulness teacher in my part of the world, but I needed somebody vastly senior to myself to kick my *** And the only place I could find it was in the Zen tradition. Which is not the tradition? I really wanted to work in although I was familiar with it because I have lived in Japan and so forth so Sasaki Roshi was certainly the seniors and master in the United States. At that time and he's now argu arguably the senior living Buddhist master in the world at 102. I love having started his practice monastic practice at the age of 13 do the math. How long is This guy been practicing. I had to study with someone so it wasn't really in the tradition. I was drawn to do all teachers. Think I need someone to kick me in the *** to do I mean, most? No. Some People a lot do. But some People go off on that's one of the ways that teachers. But the wheels sort of come off if a teacher doesn't put themselves under some other teacher. They get a certain degree of experience and then there's sort of often but then now they don't have feedback loops and their students won't give him feedback as they are in all of them and problems can develop so I wanted to make sure I see very healthy of you to send I need somebody. I think it's just a safety was like a safety net, you know that even though at that time I had practiced for a long time I still wanted someone else, I've gotten 3 things from him one is I learned. Not to suppress my sense of self. In my initial years of practice. I thought other but does says Enlightenment is no self. If I have any sense of self. Then then I'm not making progress and suddenly I was suppressing self preferential body sensations, mental image is an internal talk, the stuff that self preferential that gives you the sense of self moment by moment I was suppressing that I was trying to get rid of that and Sasaki Roshi is a very balanced teacher, so he teaches that. Yes, there's no self. And then there's full self and those are both know self experiences. OK, there's self has nothing whatsoever. Uh as TS Eliot said this still point between 2 waves of the sea. And then there is The Wave, which is the personality arising not as a thing. But as a doing and I've been suppressing the doing of self. And so he disabused me of that imbalance in my practice that was the first thing that example or did he still bias. Direct teachings like all he constantly emphasized that always cycling between experiences of of 0 self? And the re arising of the feeling thinking Self, and then it goes back to 0 and this is a natural process. Everybody participates in it. Enlightenment People realize their participating in it, and really enlightened People participated. It wholeheartedly without preference. One side versus the other so I got you disabuse me of my notion of preferring no self to fullness of tuun fixate itself. OK then he gave me the paradigm of impermanence in terms of expansion and contraction, which represents a vast generalization of the early Buddhist concept of a Nietzsche or impermanence. An and it's a far more flexible an encompassing model and puts a whole positive spin on what in early Buddhism was sort of looked at as part of suffering and added negative spin. So I got that expansion contraction paradigm, which very nicely Maps on to mathematics and physics and it's just a very, very useful way of guiding People into the experience of improvements. I got that from him. The other thing I got from him was sort of the direct vibe. When does when you're with him. He is space, expanding and contracting and that tends to reach out and sort of pull you into his world and then but then you have to go back to the meditation Hall and you have to internalize that sample of enerji see some People they get shut the part. They get a ZAP of energy from a teacher, but then what do they? Do immediately after that? Well, the thing bajans to the teacher and they talk about how great the teacher is and. Etc, etc. So it becomes a whole devotional thing, and then they're just a leaky capacitor that loses that shot be and then they need another recharging what I like about Zen is they never talk about it, but when you go in for the Zen interview. You get ZAP of the flow of nothingness from that teacher, but then what do you do you sit around and then sing the praises of that teacher and get into a whole cult no they send you? Back to the meditation Hall, where it's cold in the winter or there's bugs. Biting you in the summer. You're sleepy you're getting beat up you're getting yelled at all of this **** is happening now? Can you apply that flow that you got from the teacher to this situation, meaning you internalize it and true they make it yours. So you become like that feature not a devotee. Of that teacher that's the difference between the gurus app in one tradition and in the Zen tradition and that's I got that from him within that context. So those 3 things dis abusing me of my subtle tendency to suppress the self. Giving me this incredibly powerful paradigm that Maps nicely under science with regards to impermanence as the fundamental insight. And then a sort of direct transfer of that. Flow of impermanence from him, but within the context of making me strong and independent of him because I would immediately have to go and actually apply and internalize it and make it my own.","title":"3 Things Shinzen got from Joshu Sasaki Roshi"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/3-watershed-moments-shinzen-remembers-the-self-separating-from-the-source/","text":"There is the very instant when something starts.

What happened was it felt like my skin all over my body was burned with singeing very hot and the neurologist. Everybody, said it was probably in response to the pain. They couldn't. They said it's just your bodies into an alarm alert mode. That's getting activated by this fear so like I have that In addition, so you talk about hot. You know, I've got that on the outside. This kind of thing in that that will definitely that directly corresponds with the intensity of the field, OK, so is that that's enough isn't it? That's a lot to work with, but actually I need a little more information do you think that it's? That is interacting with subtle levels of talk or image. Very very slow why do you mean interacting by that I mean that fear? And sadness might be intensified by. At subtle subliminal activations of visual or auditory thinking. What I think is happening and this is just having been working with it now for awhile? I think it's like if there's a deck of cards. That's all the images and thoughts that we have in a pool that one hit something and it went down and if there were like little shavings of metal. I'm sorry. I went back away from deck of cards will shaving all of those came up in each one of those is an image or it could be image or talks stuff, but it's just like in so you might get little flicks like of popcorn, but it might not be enough. To go Oh yes, that's what that's when I was fat exactly what I mean? When that comes up. It can poke it can it can it can kind of like add a little of a little bit of a wood shaving to the fire, but it's like the feel called that up and then that might poke in the feel a little bit. But if I stay with the field. They just kind of hang out so the answer to the question is yes, there is interaction with subtle. Her which OK is significant, yeah, and also characteristic of Catharsis. Although it may primarily come up as body feel flavors. Subliminal auditory and visual thinking often enters into the cache salt, especially the visual. Because People don't usually hear hell they usually see how. Although in theory, you can hear it, too, but image spaces where the monsters are. That might be linked to all of this so that gives me some of the more information that I need OK now believe it or not yet more questions. OK, we go as well. We gotta see what's really going on and I don't just doing your house? Yeah, Well, you are very warehouse. MD is called differential answer my huge diagnostic skills. OK, so. The let's see here. Have you ever had the experience of having strong fear. That was pervasive through the body, so dissolve into flow that it no longer cost you suffering. Yes. How about sadness? He had ever done, OK, so then you've already done what we're going to be working towards where you going to be working towards that experience. Yet again because it's a matter of I mean basically. What let's see 1234 maybe there's 4 kinds of human beings? I mean there's a lot of ways to classify humans right. But maybe one way to classify all human beings is. There's most human beings. Who have never had the experience of physical pain? Flowing so completely that. It turned into a flavor of catharsis rather than a flavor of suffering. Most humans have never had that experience so that's most humans. Then there are the humans that have at least had that experience once. OK. Uh. Then there are the humans that have had that same experience, but with regards to rage terror and or grief. That's a whole other thing then physical pain. In terms of what it's like when that breaks up so we've determined and I think harder. Incomparably, harder because pain is just pain. Are the emotional sensations have been honed by evolution to grip us and control us and destroy us. They've been honed by evolution for that task that's what the hell is hell is. Rage terror grief shame flavors that have become so activated that they are able to. Convince you That not only will this be all you ever experience from now on there actually able to convince you that you never experienced anything else. There have that much distorting power, so that it seems like eternal in both directions. That would be hell. Purgatory is when. You've experienced those sensations enough that they can't cause that illusion anymore. But they're still there and you're working with them. And then The interface the threshold between purgatory and Heaven is when it turns into flow. We've been talking about so believe it or not one other question besides feared sadness. Are there hints of any other flavors in there? Like anger or shame, yeah, I actually looked specifically for them. I think the shame flavor. Can like if something happens in the extra word that embarrasses me? I feel that shame and that can trigger all this. You know it's irrational it's irrational to the present Bush told machine flavor or is it pretty much we're dealing with. Sad and had if we call fear had had had for alliteration, so I could use it. I know Nick Airport. 'Cause there's mad sad glad and had your changing my feel favors here OK don't come back that will get back to health health. Here's what's interesting you know that heat. I talked about in the body. It shares territory with shame and embarrassment in terms of the flush and so it can trigger it. So they all kind of interlinked in that way. It's all information that I need to do the guidance. And I think I have enough.","title":"3.  WORKING with INTENSE EMOTIONS guides Stephanie Nash"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/4-working-with-intense-emotion-guided-meditation-1-of-2/","text":"OK let's do it, OK, OK, so take a moment to stretch up and settle in and focus for just a second on physical relaxation into the pasture. OK, we're going to start by working in the fierce sad system. So at any given. Instance instant rather, they'll be exactly 1 of 4 states. Just fear just sad both. Or another. We're going to ignore everything else. We're just going to penetrate that once system of affective so much thesia. My wife talking makes sense. Quillan till the last 2 words, I don't recommend kinda. Greco Roman for emotional type body sensation key. I love it. Though I know OK. So I'd like you to note fear sad fear an sad or none. One of those for it. You might fear Ansett or both. Let's use fear and said with a boolean. And and operation so will get the four logically possible states of the fear sadness system. Any questions about that OK. Out loud. Fear and sad. Fear and sad. Fear and sad. Fear and sad. Fear and sad. Now go to mental labels thinking the labels rather than speaking OK. Is it still mostly both at the same time? Yes, take up. Now we're going to work just with the fear. I'm assuming that there is one or more areas of local intensity for the fear is that correct yes is it one or other several disconnected. There's probably one primary one that spreads out and it has little branches to it and then there's. A little bit of a journey to a secondary one for the most part. OK, so. The primary ones spreads branches how broad the primary. One is right at the center of my chest like right in between my rib cage called broadly are the branches spread through the body. It kind of comes down around to the side and in there, but it kind of spreads out a bit like the core center is kind of there in a kind of big odd shape and then there are ways in which I think it kind of reaches suddenly like subtle veins. Kind of going out around to the middle of my back, OK, excellent detection skill. I'm assuming that the. Sutler ramifications are of less intensity? Absolutely. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to just work with fear, the extremely not sad. I would like you to zoom out. To the subtle ramifications focus on them, only every 10 minutes. Add I'm sorry every timing out fear OK go out to the sun ramifications and work towards perfect equanimity with those subtle sensations because there's subtle. It may be possible to have complete openness with them. Even though you can't do so with the local intensities that are at the epicenter of it. So we're going to use the zoom out option on the noting. You're going to zoom out. To cover the subtle Sprint and work towards perfect equanimity with that, and don't concern yourself with the local splash of the center at all just with the global ripple in a rhythm with the mental labels of fear. Word fear any questions about that. No, you want me, I'll just repeat it back. I'm zooming out. I'm going to keep noting fear with mental labels. But I'm going to when I note fear zoom out to the sutler tributaries, so to speak of the. Of the experience of fear in my body, not tuning into the. Main Grand Central Station part of it. It's perfect. And yes, it by mental label. I mean think, to myself fear to indicate that that's the flavor and then you zoom out and then I'm just going to have to do that on your own for a few minutes OK. Able to do that pretty good. Yeah. Is there any hint? Of flow in. The global spread of the fear Oh yeah, it's pretty fluid. Yeah, it flows it, it's interesting. I tend to be flowing in general, but when I worked with this, it would it first I got like little hits of not like I started feeling not other flavors, yeah, and then then a little ticklish. But if I just kind of kept with it those which is. You know if I just kind of dismissed aid, with them dissipate so you're able to get the global component in the fear flavor to flow. Yeah, OK. Connect flow spread into the local intensity, so that you get a local global flow with the fear you know, I think I started to naturally start to do that and I think that's when the nausea started to. I think my body, but let's go for local global so that means you'll remember that there's my Standard formulation of the noting technique zoom in zoom out from the earth ways. So we're going to zoom both ways out to the perimeter. To the mix and say shows there an ride the momentum of the flow. That's there and simultaneously zoom into the core intensity and see if you can get them to get that local splash global ripple. While keeping the zooming so simultaneously, either zooming in and out into the core out to the perimeter and you're doing that. Precisely to facilitate. The spread of the global. Flow into the local intensity. To be awareness is moving in, and around at the same time, it got it. Slight you have a phrase that you came up with this sliding slide both ways. You're going to slide out with your awareness and let it facilitative global circulation of fear and you're going to slide in and let that. A facilitate a local circulation of fear, so you get both the intense areas and the peripheral areas. As a single fear flow.","title":"4. WORKING with INTENSE EMOTION - GUIDED MEDITATION (1 of 2))"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/5-working-with-intense-emotion-guided-meditation-2-of-2/","text":"And we get a little sense of that. Oh yeah, so that's That's a catharsis of releasing of fear it creates this kind of center of this. It's kind of a deep joy that kind of comes up the center, but then I get really hot, yeah, let the joy be there, then the Heat. Be there that these are all really actual stupid catharsis, OK and if the Heat produces more fear than just dissipate that in the fear except that we're going to let go of the fear now OK. And don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out what we're going to do same procedures start with the periphery of the sadness flavor work with that. See. If it's amenable through zoom out process to an experience of a global flow. In the sadness. If that's feasable do that and then. Go in and look for the local flow in the epicenter and you're going to get a local global flow in the sadness if if indeed that's Sort of doable at this time, I'd like to explore that do ability of that. With regards to sadness just give it now. Sometime. Get a little hint of that, yeah since the sadness doesn't have the same vein network of spread. I just kind of instead of since I didn't quite have this subtle area. I just want around the boundaries of that's exactly correct that corresponds to the subtle. It's just less widespread that was made the boundary soft and then treated that lights right? That's what I would have had so you're able to get a little sense of that, yeah, OK good? Yeah. Now. I'm going to have you. Do a fairly intricate concentration. Where are you going to attempt to experience simultaneous? Lee. A kind of River of fear. And a kind of River of sad. That flow through each other. Interpenetrating without interfering. So it's almost like you say that again Oh yeah right? There's the sadness flavor and it's a sort of like. Giant liquid drop that sort of expanding and contracting right right and there's the fear flavor and it's a giant liquid drop doing the same ascential dance right now, you know how. Like in ghost movie. You see that, like the ghost can walk through the wall right right goes passes through the wall. The wall gives no resistance. Now imagine you didn't have a ghost in the wall, but you had 2 ghosts. And they were both. Doing their own thing. But they could pass through each other without disturbing each other. When they occupied the same place at the same time, so you can have these 2 ghostly waves. One flavored fear the other flavors sad and there, so did dancing except in unlike physical dancers. They parts of them even all of them can occupy the same place. Uh so they? They're constantly waving and the waves pass through each other without disturbing each other without developing pressure areas where they would clash does this metaphor makes sense. Yeah. Have you attempted to do this with the fear and sad not in this not this round. This may be the middle part of the missing piece because you could get them individually default. But then the next step is collectively default because if they both flow at the same time, interpenetrating wherever they need to without interfering then. They won't multiply together into over well. And that so the ability to have more than one flavor. And to separate the flavors have all the flavors flow and then have the flow fields. Interpenetrate without interference is a sequence that I take People through when they're going through big challenges that are. That are Poly Chromatic. IMO the Poly Chromatic. Body distress, meaning a lot of different colors in the body then we need to train. The colors to flow through each other and Interestingly dance. It's an interesting. Intimacy that women. It's like they're dancing through each other as well as with each other and to the extent that they're both flowing. You'll get an even more powerful flavor purification and and hopefully a significantly deeper sense of relief. Cape Cod House had coming. Uh. OK. Bread in Watson. When I when I allow them both to share the same space and not and I'm recognizing how I've been keeping them separate and keeping the line between them. And when I allow them to just kind of do that. The kind of joy. I talked about before with the fear it's very intense version of that and then it kind of seems to ignite this kind of PT like. Energee up the body and it gets very hot, but it's getting it's enrapture riff yourself. Rather counter intuitive facial expression proves it? Yeah.","title":"5.

Let's say is rather counter intuitive facial expression proves it. Yeah, it's really interesting because, as it does, I find myself wanting to comment on it, and I'll go up and talk a minute and then and then it loses it a little bit, yeah, and you have to come out to be done purely in them, yeah, comments and then it does trigger some. Little chocolates to go visit there all about it in your use of practice allowed you to say that and not sort of go down that yeah well. Pressly's motivation to kind of stay with this, it's kind. It's it's intrinsically rewarding no next step. See if you can have the fear in the sadness. Dancing with, and through each other with your eyes open. And you may find D focusing the eyes initially. Helpful. So we can maintain it somewhat into more ordinary experience. It's interesting when I am. 'Cause I kind of go in and out here as I do it and I'm going to talk all keeping my eyes open, but I'm getting to where I'm horning in on the one specific place in the body. They both share in a powerful way an if I can just kind of keep track of flow there, letting it be, whether it's red or blue you know. It. It kind of helps maintain it with my eyes open. Now see if you can keep some contact with that. Even after we make some eye contact. It may be a little trick here, but Up this. Is what we just did here is probably one of the missing pieces in the? Of the solution to the situation that you described an not sure it's all of the missing pieces. I've got a few other ideas. Besides this, but I think for this is a good for this session one. One Epiphany is we have price of admission. I leave that money on the table. The you haven't done this before. This theme well, I've never. Inter digitation was a word, You used to use and it's so interesting as soon as you guided me on this, I thought. Oneguide somebody else in this. I'll guide somebody else in this but I didn't think of it for me. I was just holding remember to do this. You remember to get the flavors to do that. I have other People didn't remember that you could do it for yourself. I was just all my circuits were just so full. I guess or would you know that goes to a very general principle in the way I set up my approach to meditation which is that the assumption is that? When People face real challenges. Even People without a background in practice if you interactively guide them will be able to have pretty dramatic experiences pretty consistently dramatic positive experiences. It is also been my experience that People that are quite good at meditation when they're faced with realize life challenges can easily forget. But all you need is somebody to do this right. Oh yeah, I knew how to do that, yeah, and then now you're set. You know this is one session. We don't need 20 years of therapy here. It's OK now. You don't know what to do so. I think that's excellent, but I will for subsequent sessions. Remind me that I had some other ideas of why can actually just tell me now and they're like nicely play it and go member. You gotta finish it so the other thing is that OK one missing piece was well. The 2 flavors have to simultaneously flow and through each other another possible missing piece. Is that you're getting significant interaction with subliminal thinking? Right and you might want to look in that direction and the way you look in that direction. what I was going to have you work through work with is a special exercise that with all the years we've done. I'm not sure we've ever done. This one, but I'll ask you have. We ever done, noting feel sources. What that means is I have. You note if there's No Fear. You say No Fear if there is fear but it's not triggered by anything you're aware of you say just? Fear and then you specify if the fear has been triggered by fear from image fear from talk fear from sound feel from site or fear from touch. Now we have an Evernote noted fear. I call that noting field sources and field can be generic or specific that that was the next thing I had in the Hopper to try after this, because what may be happening is that you're getting significant triggering. From from other senses that are activating the fear in real time and usually what you know how I always say. OK, what is science in a nutshell? How much of what? When an where interacting in what ways and changing at what rates typically. I emphasize the what the where the rates of change, but some of the special techniques are designed to elucidate the interactions specifically what's triggering Watt and I find that when People are going through significant? Intractable fear experiences or emotion in general, but especially fear literally a few minutes of noting. What is triggering that fear in terms of broadly of the broad sensory categories so we can now detect No Fear fear but not a triggered by anything OK? Don't fear fear fear from image fear from talk and especially subtle image and subtle to the subliminal stuff, the way you know that's happening is you get a tug twords image space or a Tord stock space. No content awareness at all but the next instant. There's a spike in the fear and the body now. You know that the sun. Quite aware of having that yeah, the subconscious well. It turns out if you ask yourself if you constrain yourself in real time to note did it come from image talk sight sound or the physicality of the body 'cause. It's gotta be one of those one of those, 5 right that. Keeping track of the of the whole system somehow that vastly reduces the over well. So when you're doing that, you're zooming out for example of in for me. I'm less aware. I can tell when I've gone to image space. But I'm not seeing tangible image at this time and I'm a little bit of a sign of subliminal and hence highly significant activity. An I'm aware that with talking with talk. I can hear a little more of a rumble but I still can't so am I equally. Awareness equally distributed between image and talk are you don't have to actually worry about how to distribute your awareness OK because most People discover they know as soon as you give them.","title":"6.

You've got the beginnings of a mindfulness practice and then the core curriculum is set up so that there are sort of level. One programs in the five ways. And there's a Part 2. That's sort of like a more detailed deeper version and you take that the next month. So after you take Part 1, one month in part due the next month. Now you know that entire way so that in theory in say 10 months if you were to participate every month. You would have learned all five of them, but you may not want to learn all 5. You may want to just learn one of them and stay with that, so we have the intro. Pro we have core curriculum that teaches the part one and Part 2 of each of the five ways and then we have for People once they learn those techniques. They have deepening retreat sharpening retreats and special application retreats. The sharpening retreats, I guide them interactively with special exercises that sharpen their ability and then the theme retreats. They apply the techniques to certain themes like dealing with pain or dealing with emotions or dealing with behavior change or decision, making any practical. Practical applications that they can have wow. So yeah, so it's a very carefully organized curriculum and basically. I would say to summarize it and it doesn't cost appreciable money. In fact, if you don't have money doesn't cost anything and we tell you how to get. Are really cheap long distance calling So what happens? Is People call in their socializing. Then there's an hour and a half guidance around the theme, which may involve kewene then People hang out so People can your guiding but People can actually ask you question interact with me in the group setting and then after an hour and a half. Everyone hangs up and they practice on their own for an hour during that period of time they can stretch and get coffee, not sitting well that's right. But also during that period of time they can call me personally. 90 People no typically what happens is there's about 60 People and about one out of 10 has a need during that program to talk to me and they have my private number. We public we give out when you register my private telephone number that goes with the turf so. It's usually about 10% of the People need to talk to me and I can usually handle those in that hour period. So you actually get a chance to talk. If you really need it 1. On one with me and if I back up, then I make an appointment with you to talk to you. Later that day or very soon afterwards. So it serves as the potential for touching based personally with the teacher any month. You need that and then after that, after that hour they come back and. We have a group Q&A for 1/2 an hour. And then they everybody here is everybody here is is the other the other questions and then there's another hour of guidance. And then there's a little more socializing and and 4 hours have passed and you've had 4 hours of a retreat like environment. All the features that you'd get at a residential retreat. A talk guidance chance to work on your own chance to talk to a teacher chance to hear other people's questions and experience. It's all packed into 4 tightly organized hours don't have to leave home. Don't have to leave your family don't have to mess with your work schedule. Well, because anybody can get 4 hours on some weekend usual question. If I've never meditated before an I'm going to be doing one of these for our retreats. do I have to get those cushions. People have or? How do I know what? If you go to basicmindfulness.org there's a document? Which is about the posture OK so I don't have to like burn incense or now there's no particular environment needed. You don't even mean it's nice if it's quiet but it's not required if kids are running in and it doesn't matter because that's the whole point of mindfulness. You deal with? What is so you don't have to burn incense you don't it's nice if you can get off and it's a quiet environment. But if you can't that's just part of what we work with.","title":"Advanced and Specialized meditation on the phone.  How phone retreats work."},{"location":"shinzenvideos/after-enlightenment-love-deeply-act-effectively/","text":"Speaking of motivation. Um. Why do this practice if someone asks you if you had to summarize? And sort of like simplify. If you had to just say one thing. Why do this practice? I would say so as to be of optimal service to others if I had to just say one thing. Um. There is this. A series of. Pictures. From China but it's also found in Japan, Korea, Vietnam called the 10 Oxherding Pictures. Uhm the first YouTube that we ever put up was a talk that I gave on the 10 Oxherding Pictures. Here God only knows how long ago. Maybe Stef knows I can look it up my teachers use them. It's a metaphor from that sort of lost probably N Americans. But anyone from Asia that grew up was particularly S. Southern parts of Asia would know what the metaphor was so young boys go off into the forest and they look for a young water Buffalo. It said ox, but it's actually a water Buffalo, you know they have these very big horns. They find a juvenile water Buffalo, and they they catch it and they make a relationship with it. Um and Tainment, an it's a lifelong relationship and then as the boy grows up often their peasants. So there going to be a farmer and the ox grows up and the ox is used for tilling the fields and also to ride on into town or for pulling carts and things like that. So them it's a metaphor for the process of enlightenment. So it starts out that you. You are completely clueless you just this can't wandering around without a clue. Which is where everyone starts pretty much? And then you get a clue, the clue is you see you see the. Footprints of the ox. You haven't seen the ox, but there's an indirect indication that this critter exists. So that would be maybe you read a book or you heard a Dharma Talk or maybe something in your life sort of told you that there's more to life than what most People think there is in terms of what's possible. So you see the footprints. And then it builds on that you follow the footprints until you see the tail. So all of you have reached the point where you've seen the tail fee had a a good meditation and we've all had good meditations right? That's sort of seeing the tail. It's not really the same as seen that the ox, though, that's a little different then you. You see just sort of the rear end of the ox, OK, but you are seeing the ox. Those are those glimpses. That many of you have had. Of all. It's not a stream entry, but it's sort of like in that direction, but it it evaporates. But now you've actually seen the ACS at least part of it. Uhm and then there is. Seeing whole locks and it's like there for you now that could happen suddenly. Often, that happens or the gradually over a period of many years, so that is really wonderful so the ox represents the nature of nature of the nature of. Consciousness the word there's a word in East Asian languages, Mandarin Chinese. It's Shim in Japanese. It's almost identical shin without a tone Korean is Shim and Vietnamese his thumb. Which sounds more like the Cantonese some as in dim sum and actually she needs to warm your heart or touch your heart literally. Oh, so. It means hard, but it also means consciousness. Sensory experience motor experience broadly translates cheetah in Sanskrit, so this is the channel. This is the ox. That represents the nature of consciousness. AKA sensory and motor experience. So now you seen the ox. You've seen the nature of consciousness. But you're not done by any means, in fact. You just begun the challenge as wonderful as it is to have actually seen the nature of consciousness, which. Is sometimes called the put the nature? Uh or the activity of the Dharmakaya body of the absolute but it could also be called the activity of impermanence. AKA expansion and contraction that's the paradigm that I like to use. So once you've seen it good, but now you gotta get on it, you got a rope, it, and then you gotta learn to write it. And that's very challenging because that ox can Buck very intensely. In other words stuff happens. In in your life in the world. Uh and the ability to stay on that ox, no matter how intensely it Bucks. Is a long long training? But at some point you could stay on and then you write you write it home. It just carries you. Hope. Now. That takes you to. The ace of the pictures. So. There's an oral tradition, not a written tradition, but an oral tradition. In Soto Zen and the only reason I know about it is that a Soto Zen Master. Told me Uh. So. On the Internet you can see one of my youtubes where I actually do something that most people in the Buddhist world don't do that. I actually describe the moment that I saw the whole locks. Uhm but there is a tradition of in send that. You're supposed to go to a senior master. Um and Uh sort of. Describe the experience you have and then see what they have to say about it. So I was in the US at that time, so I wasn't in contact with my teachers in Japan. Um an and the only person that I actually personally knew that was like a Zen Master of great stature and great seniority relative to me at the time was my Azumi Roshi. Some of you may have heard of him. He was his lineages very prominent in US Buddhism. Zam at this point, so he was the only like. O sheet that I knew. And but I didn't know him very well. We just you know, I talk occasionally 'cause you know, I was living in the Buddhist ghetto? what I called we used to call the Buddhist. Ghetto is in Korea Town. It's like where New Hampshire and Vermont and Olympic that area. There lot of Buddhist centers. There was a Korean centered thomasa or something and was since in him master soon son. There was sent center of La where my 0 she was there was the international Buddhist meditation center where I was living. So. The Sensor Valley was sorted down the street and over the years you know, we've done things together. But I I didn't really know myosin. We wrote you very well. But he was the only person that I could think too. 2. Go to an I have a bit of trepidation because. I didn't really know him that well and I'm going to like talk about this thing and. You know a lot of Times, some of those said Masters sort of ferocious and I mean, I knew what I had experienced I wasn't really. Nervous about that, but I thought there's a pretty good probability you know they? The general style and Zen is no matter what it is, you're wrong that is a general styling. That may or may not be the best pedagogical approach. You'll notice that is not the approach. I use sort of the opposite of that, but I had come to expect whatever it is, you're wrong. So I was fully expecting him to say you're full of **** kid get outta here. But I don't think it would've bothered me a lot, but it would have been a little embarrassing. Uhm but he did not say that at all, I said the very opposite of that. So yeah, that's it, but you're just starting. And that was a law was decades ago, and he was right just starting. So because you seen the are so now you gotta get on it, and then all this stuff is going to happen and he got to stay on it. So. Uh. So I asked him is it OK to tell People. And he said well if you think that it will help inspire People. Yeah, you can actually. Tell People so. Um. And. He told me about the heart of the oral transmission in the Soto Zen school about the Oxherding Pictures. With we were talking about that as a metaphor. Um so he said that in this oral tradition, which I don't know if it's written down anywhere, but I know I heard it directly from him. The last 3 pictures are not actually stages. That the path ends at 8:00. Uh like Seven 890, Yeah, at 7:00, So what is 8 nine and 10 so. 8 is a just a blank page with absolutely nothing on it. 9 is a picture of trees and mountains just like. Ordinary stuff. The natural world. And 10 is a picture of this sort of Santa Claus, like guy. A named hotel in Japanese. What walking into the marketplace? Um with a bag full of goodies, then just passing them out to People and the caption in Chinese says entering the marketplace with hand outstretched. 44 characters. And he said that those last 3. Represent the Thai soul you that's Japanese tea. Sean young in Mandarin Chinese, they represent the substance. The appearance. And the ultimate use. Of Enlightenment, So the substance is the blank page. The appearance is everything. And the ultimate use the ultimate motivation why we do this in the end. Is to be a sort of approachable ordinary person? Who are? Has this secret bag of goodies? That you can pass out to anyone who is realize is what you have. And you're in the marketplace your. It. Well let me just say this the. The word for marketplace in Persian, you know the word. It's bizarre, which is also where I work bizarre comes I'm OK, so in many parts of the world of the premodern world marketplaces. It's pretty wild OK. It's like all of life is just sort of hanging out there. So you're walking into the bizarre the bizarreness of the world. Completely looking like you belong there. And anyone can approach you and you have these goodies to give up so that is the yolk or the you in Japanese, which means the the purpose. The goal the ultimate activity? Why you did, all the other things. Why did all that work with the ox is so that you could be of significant service to the world and my first teacher emphasized this. A lot. He was a team master and when I would go to talk about practice. I quoted his house now when you think of a house. You're thinking of an American House OK, you gotta think of a Japanese House, which is like about 110th the size of American House so you know it was just. Couple little rooms and so I was we didn't be in this room and he'd make tea for me and he'd always point out that he had this picture of the wall of painting monochrome and it wasn't in the usual sort of pictures that the boot up the Buddha is walking and he's walking down the mountain. He's leaving the monastery so to speak they are strongly's coming down into the city. All. And we would always say that. That's your image that that's the icon that I want you to remember why I'm teaching you all of these things. It's called in Japanese shoes, some little shaka to Sean Lee, leaving the mountain. So uhm. If I had to sum it all up. It's Um. 2. Uh. Live to serve from love. So where does that come from? How does that come about? For a practitioner. Because I can assure you that that wasn't the kind of person I was. Early in life. All. I was early in life, the very antithesis of that person. I didn't like being around People at all. I just wanted to be left alone. And I was always uncomfortable around people in general. And I was particularly uncomfortable around People who are uncomfortable themselves who would be going through some something bad in their life or whatever. I just could not handle being around that kind of thing. So what happened. Well. 4 things happened. I took on this practice and it was really hard and I failed over and over and over and over again. Couldn't concentrate? Couldn't handle the retreats? First, two retreats, I redid I bailed out in the middle. Site. I gotta get the hell outta here. Probably shouldn't tell you that he could role model. But it's true. I'm in halfway through. I just knew for sure that the best thing that I could do to nurture my spiritual essences get the hell outta here now and then I believe, and it's like all the pressure was off in the psych? Why did I do that. Uh. You know it happened once and you think you learn but then it happened again. The next retreat halfway through. It's like I'm outta here. Um. So. I would say my early experiences. Were experiences of being miserable? And, of not being able to implement a technique. Uh basically experiences of failing with the practice. Um. At the time. My interpretation was of course. I'm I can't do this and no good at this, I'm a failure. I'm a screw up. At the time that was the impression it was only years later. Years later. Looking back that I realized that those initial experiences of misery and frustration. Um. We're hugely important. For the big picture of my growth hugely important. I I did not know it at the time. But the seeds of compassion were being. Planted. Um. Because. We. First, Noble truth of Buddhism. The truth of suffering. Was? So much in my face. Um. That. It left this impression. Regarding the importance. Of. Not suffering and So that I would say that one of the important factors for me personally. In changing becoming a very different kind of person was failing with this practice and finding this practice difficult and just being miserable. You know, I would it was Japan. It was you know. 0 tolerance policy, we tell you the first day you know it's OK to move after the Bell. Well. Not in, not in Zen, not in Japan, you move a muscle in the yell at you, or hit. You would be like in the morning. I could still remember even though this is almost 50 years ago. I can still remember sitting there. And it's like cold. And my nose is running but you you can't move. And you can definitely cannot sniffle and it's like this festoons of snot. Murray came down. OK, like voice through my clothes and I'm sitting there with this blue drop. I'm just miserable just you know. But in retrospect, I realize. I was growing and changing and really important ways. Just didn't realize it at the time. So I would say that one of the main factors that leads one to the ultimate goal of this practice is the. Difficulty that we experience early on with this practice. Uhm OK what other factors. Well, I mentioned my teacher. I was indoctrinated. In the philosophy of Mahayana Buddhism. I was told. As a concept. In the end This is why you do it. Uhm I think that that indoctrination was a good thing. I'm glad I was told. Um. And guess what now you've been told. So I hope you will accept that. That point of view. So another reason was well People told me and I believe them. That's the Bodie Sodfa Spirit Mahayana. So that's a factor just playing up indoctrination in a certain philosophy about practice. What else? Role models. I saw the same pattern over and over and over again. Different countries. Teachers of different race. But it was always the same pattern. Which is years of intense practice? And then They're just in the office all day. Available to the world. The first time I saw that pattern was with someone that some of you know, she's passed away. But her name was Nikola Geiger. How many of you remember Nicola quite a quite a few. Yeah, that was quite a while ago. So. OK, how can I put it? If you saw the movie Schindler's list. Well. That's what her world at the age of 20 was. But not because she was Jewish actually she was the opposite. She was Up from German aristocratic family. Uh. And when she was very little, she joined the Deutsche MATC and boot. The Hitler youth for the. Girls the women and girls. Because she's just a little girls that know any better, it's like all earth and. Folks Geist and you know seem very appealing, but then, when she grew up, she realized the evil of the Nazis. And she was part of this group that there was actually you know, there was the French there was a French resistance. Oh no that's called the self Verizon. OK. How I need to see you fully manifest? OK, that's pretty good, I didn't mean to humiliate itself. I mean, like I'm so happy that everyone is being. Say that Pastor Cohen. CarMax. Say what I want to put the recording. How is good you pass a cold? It just wait. My brother, Steve really fast. Everybody watch Betsy for. After intrusive device there, we go? I'm so proud of you. Up. So. From the sublime to the ridiculous and now back to the supply. So yeah, there there was the you know like the French Resistance and whatever but there was there were actually people in Germany that were fighting the Nazis secretly. When they were in full power during World War II, it, she was part of that group and they made they made a movie about them, called the White Rose Ann if you see what happens in that movie well. That's what happened to her and her friends. So just horrible horrible. But Fortunately she had been taught how to Meditate by her father, from the time she was she could crawl. They were associated with the writer Herrman Hessa and you may know the League of Journeyer's to the E there's this classic book called the journey to the E. Uh. This is oral history. I haven't confirmed it but apparently it actually that actually existed in Nicholas father was part of it. And they were Christian but they were Buddhist influenced during the Vimar Republic between the wars in Germany anyway, so she had been taught how to Meditate, which is the only reason that. She was able to. Not be completely destroyed by the things that happened. So when I met her. Oh. The way I met her, I've been a Zen Monk in kill Tal. And you go on tagging rounds, I mentioned about that so. There are these rules very strict rules. You can't like go places where you know you're going to get good Donna. Yeah, I have to like go evenly to all places so you can't like you know try that farm the places where it's known that you get good Donna, but still all the Zen monks in kilts on new where the good. Donna it was even though you weren't allowed because the roots are set so you have to follow a set route. But if On that particular day you route takes you by one of the good. Donna locations well. That's good. Why is that good? Where you don't keep that money OK that goes into a common pot but the good thing about scoring with good. Donna that you're only allowed to collect to a certain amount. And if someone gives you a big amount. You're you're done with your Donald rounds, So what you do is you go. Find a bridge. Some place where no one can see you. The group that you go out in groups of 3, two on these begging rounds. So the 3 People will like find someplace out of sight and you know what you do you sleep because he is always sleep deprive right so good Donna means you're going to get like an hour of sleep, Sport Hood. But you're not like I say you're not allowed to go seek that. But there was this one house where when you would go by it. Clearly, a foreigner live there because it said Nicora Incana on on the front door. But uh made would come out and like give you like a big Donna thing OK. And so all the monks new nicora so I always thought it was a Russian Man 'cause. The name in on the clients are coming so anyway. I get this letter. Let's signed Nicola and it says this is when I back up my koi. And it says I'm the director of friends World College E Asian. Campus. Which is a Quaker International University and? I heard that you're an American and the air at Mount Koya. Our students don't speak Japanese so would you be willing to show them around not coy and give them a little lecture on Buddhism in English because their international so I thought this must be that Nicola. So I said, yeah come on up and I was like I say expecting Russian man. Instead, it was his German Hausfrau. And uhm with this really strong accent and so it was like OK. Show the students around and she says. If you're ever in the city of kill to come visit me here is my address so few months go by. Sure enough, I have some business in kilter, which is you probably notice the. Old capital of Japan and just a few hour hour drive from Mount Koya. So I go to her house and she says. I'll come up. For some reason, she decided to call me. Steven something told her that's my name is Steven come on up so. She says you know why. Why I wanted you to come visit me? An I said no. And then she proceeded to tell me exactly where I was at with my meditation practice and what I needed to be doing. It turns out that she she was friends with. All the Greek Zen Masters in the city of killed all and it was like she had. This incredible background. I course I couldn't see it. She just looked like an ordinary person, but she could see who I was. And the main thing that she said, is. I mean without talking to me at all just watching me. It's like she said. Yes, I can see that you're able to sort of be in a meditative state, which is pretty good, but you have to learn how to serve People and you have to learn how to be comfortable around People. Oh. And it's like well, surprising that she could still and know that. Um so I observed her and I had a role model, I could see what it was. This is the result of a lifetime of practice this is a result of. Having. Stayed on the ox. Wow, you're watching your friends being guillotine. This is the result of having stayed on the ox well. Russian troops are raping you. Ah this is the result of staying on the ox. When you're being a interrogated by the SS and you're 20 years old. What's the result of having done that. Is Oh just here and available? To help People through their stuff. Um. And I saw the entire spectrum of Japanese society. Um walking across her crossing her threshold over a period of a number of years, everything from the highest to the lowest. From the Great Masters of them. To ya kuza? Which if you don't know it well? I'm sure you do know what that is that's bad news Japanese criminals but she could relate to them. On. Left wing terrorists international terrorist. I couldn't believe it. I mean like criminal terrorists. Um. Would come? And she pets something to give them. Um. And everything in between. Just OK this is a person that can relate to everyone that's comfortable around. Sinners and Saints equally. That's a role model. And then later on, I lived in a Chinese monastery the Chinese bastard same thing. Exactly the same thing. And over and over again, I saw this pattern. This is this is where it ends up you're basically in the marketplace. Not in the sense of selling your wares. But in the sense of just available after I completed my. 100 days of isolation my best friend was attend I monk. Um. So there's xinggan and there's 10 thought those are the 2 schools that were dominant in Japan. During the her period. Hey on is when kill to as the capital before before then before Pure Land and so forth. The 2:00 schools were 10 died shingle so and each was on a different mountain. Sing on is on Mount Koya and 10 days are Matt not here in Mount. He is right next to the city of kilter. So my best friend. Candice on Uh was a 10 dot monk from Osaka. And he was my age, so he said. Now that you've completed the 100 days of training and I thought I was hot stuff after 100 days. No Westerner, it ever done that particular practice. So he said. Not now that you've done that I think you, you can meet my teacher. Oh, so come to Mount Hiei. Let's go meet my teacher so his teacher. Was one of the quote Marathon monks amount here you can actually find this on? Uh the Internet. I think they even have U tubes of it. There's a documentary documentary. Uh use it on the Internet, it's on YouTube. I think it's called a marathon monks amount he? But the Japanese don't call the marathon monks. That's a western term. They Japanese called them die go Mama Jardien. Majority is a charya it means is from the Sanskrit means of teacher, the same routers Upjohn in Thailand. So I'll Charlie's teacher master die Yeoman means someone who is completed, the great practice. And it is a great practice like I say I thought I was hot stuff after 100 days in isolation. This is 12 years in isolation. And during that 12 years. You do a few things that you would not think any human being could do like sit for my days without food or water or sleep? Uh a couple times actually. So. I had like actually I'm sitting down having a meal with someone who's done that. And just sort of shooting the breeze. Um and talking about practice of course, 'cause that was very salient for me at the time. And he's telling me about the traditions of this 12 year practice on Mount here. Um. So you wouldn't you wouldn't think a person could do it, but People do. And In addition to like the nine day sits they do these 100 day walks up and down Mount he ate. So they walked down the mountain into the city of kill to chant mantras. And prayers at every shrine and temple major one in the city then come back up the mountain studded winter. Of that walk takes about 20 hours. And they do a hundred of those walks in a row. So that leaves 4 hours for everything else rest eating bathing. Um. You wouldn't think a person that's where the term marathon comes from. You wouldn't think you could survive that but People. Uhm but you You know my thing is. I want to figure out how to work smart, so that it's not a for you folks. It's not a brute force algorithm OK, but you work, smart, so you can get similar effects. Without having to go through the the brutality and intensity of the old school practice and it is my dream to figure out how to do that 'cause the average person is not going to ever take on something like this. So, in any event. When each each day of this 12 years. Um. They carry with them. Um Tonto Tonto is like a short samurai sword. Uh. And a rope. Now it's a symbolism of one of the main deities. Call food Oh. Football is fu deal you can look up on the Internet. If you're interested archilla, not a is his name in Sanskrit and he sort of ferocious looking and he has a rope in one hand and sword in the other hand, so the rope stands for somebody. 'Cause you sort of bind attention in a concentrated way, and then the sword or the knife. Stands for what you think it stands for that's the wisdom. So it's like the Shamatha and vipashyana right, rope is somebody in concentrated then the wisdom is the Sword that cuts through so they carry the attributes of this voting Safa Ocella in Sanskrit or though, if you deal. Are in Japan Japanese but it also has another meaning besides? Symbolic of the practice. Um maybe you can guess if they fail they have to commit suicide. Yes, if they cannot complete even one day of the 12 year commitment they take their own life. Either by hanging or You know. From the knife. So OK that's you know, maybe you're feeling a little weird right now, but In all honesty that did not make me feel weird at all, I got it. I can't. All once again, I'm not saying. I expect anyone to practice that way. At all. But I got it when he explained. Um. 'Cause I was still a kid and so you still ask why just 25 years old. So you still ask embarrassing questions. I even love People like that. So I asked him would you have done it? Would you have actually killed yourself if you couldn't make? One day of it. Any city out. Um. And he said, I'll tell you why. Because the only way that we've been able to do this for the last 1000 years. And that's how long we been doing it on that mountain. It only reason we've been able to keep this up for 1000 years? Is everyone that does this has made that commitment. And so. That. That resolve. Is what allows us to do this? And. My sense of gratitude towards this practice is so great. That I'm willing to take my own life to in order to maintain. This tradition to make it possible for future generations to do this. So yeah, it's extreme and yet you don't have to. You know. Have the Japanese. You know suicide pilot do or die mentality to get enlightened but. I got it, it make it did not weird me out at all. It just made sense. That's how grateful you are that's how important it is. Um. So. What did he do all day I got to observe him same thing just like all the other People, he's just there. And People from the village common People from the city of kill to come and they've got this problem and they've got that problem and they know what he's been through. In the old days in Japan, they didn't have psychoth erapists. People had problems where did they go they went to People like him. Um. And he's got something to give so. One has these role models. One is indoctrinated into a certain philosophy of practice. One is miserable at the beginning, a lot. So these are factors. That lead to. To it being quite natural. To see the If you had to just say one thing that this practice is about. It's becoming the person that is approachable is just there. And has something deep and important to give to a wide spectrum of. Human beings flat the whole spectrum of human beings. Then there's one other factor and it's also very import. So it's sort of the flip side of failure. The flip side of failure is success. So. At some point you see the ox. It might happen suddenly but it probably going to just sort of sneak up on you. As time goes on. You see the source. And when you see the source your source. You see everyone source. Um. And. When you finally are able to stay on the ox 24/7. Just as before, you took on the practice. You could not a scape from fundamental alienation. Without this practice, you can't escape from fundamental alienation everyone has it unless something dramatic happens. Fundamental Alienation is that rock solid sense that there is a your identity ends with your skin. But there is. A tangible barrier between inside and outside. US versus them I versus it that's constantly present in all perceptions. And there's just no escape from it, and everybody assumes it's the nature of reality. But after you've written on that ox for awhile. You cannot escape the opposite of that. You can't escape it. It's in your face 24/7. Everything use. See or hear or touch. Is being loved into existence right in front of you? By this. Activity of the source this formula swoon. And that's the first thing you perceive. Each time you turn your head. Or. Reach out touch the world, the first thing you perceive before anything else. Armor Primeiro. Is this? Cosmic love, Um. And. It. It's just natural to want to be of service to this larger identity. It's just natural. Oh. And it's very, very. Empowering. And. Um. Comforting. Because. Just like anyone else. You judge You like this one, you don't like that one. You find this. Person, who's empowered to be wonderful or this person who's empowered to be scary and horrible just like anybody else. But that comes a moment later. That's a moment later. And therefore. It's just in a very different context. So there in lies. The secret to. Um. Being of used to this world. Love deeply that's what I mean by love deeply. Act effectively.

That's like what should we do what do we need to do in this human life? Well, I would I would say 3 things? One thing Is? To learn how to appreciate I'll just use an aide to abbreviate that. Appreciate Sensorially. The world of 4. Actually, there's 2 worlds of 4, there's the form of the outside. What we see physically what we hear physically and the physical sensations in the body that is the apparent object if world and then we react to that object if world. Also with see, hear feel we have mental images, which is our visual thinking. We have mental talk, which is auditory thinking and then we have emotional type body sensations that are sort of. Typically have a little different quality from the simply physical type sensations, and that inner system is. Form it has its sensory and its visual auditory and somatic. So when you see a flower for example. There's see out of the flower and typically there's see in here in Feelin. Reactions to the flower there's thoughts and emotions those thoughts and emotions, maybe on the surface of awareness so that they are fully conscious or they may be subliminal. They may be below the threshold of awareness, perhaps not immediately observable at the beginning of your practice. But as your detection skills grow you will start to be able to detect these subtle levels of subjective. Activation. So let's say that you wanted to have a truly satisfying experience of looking at flower well. Actually, there be sort of two ways. You could go about doing that one is. You could so fully focus on the outer form this the C out. That, it expands and the Inter reactive system. the C in here in Feelin contracts and so there is just there's an experience of flowering. Without a sense of an eye observing so that would be a kind of. Merging or non dual experience with the flower that would come about through out expanding while in contracts into an all rest or even on all gone situation that would be one way of going about having a really satisfying experience of seeing a flower or seeing anything how about hearing same thing about having physical contact with something. Uh. Including hunger or sleepiness OK? How could we have a satisfying experience of other outs, one way is this just the out. And little or no in form, even great physical pain if there's no reactive see in here and feeling if it's just feel out there's really good. It could be anybody's body that's going through that and therefore it's everybody's body and therefore. There's an Oak anus within that, so that would be 1. Way to experience in a very satisfying way what we see here and what physically impacts. Us see here on the outside feel physically. However, another way to have a satisfying experience is that the outer and the Inter activate at the same time, but the outer. Is experience with a lot of mindfulness and also the inner is experience with a lot of mindfulness so the entire sensory experience is mindful. We are deeply appreciating not only the form of out, but the self. In this case, and we could also have experiences. You have probably notice that the inner system doesn't just react to. Up the outer it also sometimes goes proactive it spins memory plan fantasy etc. Have you notice that So what about that? Well guess Wat. The outer tends to actually contract notice it but sort of the sites in the sounds and even your physical body. But physicality of the body can sort of go into the background and the memory plan fantasy sort of self. The subject of self gets very, very large. That's fine as long as it's experienced with a lot of concentration clarity and equanimity. You are approaching a complete experience of the rising of thought and emotion. You're in the world of memory plan fantasy, but you're not lossed in that world. You are in the absolute present as past future fantasy are rising. You are sensorially in the present so. These are a number of different ways in which we can have. We can appreciate the self in the world every one of these involves 3 core skills. Concentration power sensory clarity and equanimity. So. One of our jobs would be to sensorially appreciate the self and the world just as it is. So, sometimes People have a lot of difficulty appreciating the self just as it is I have a lot of difficulty with that I. Tormented myself for probably the first 15 years of my practice. Are somehow trying to suppress or get rid of the inner activations? I thought that's the enemy of meditation? All thought and emotion is the enemy of meditation. That's the self well and so I gotta get rid of it and I was fighting with it in suppressing it and trying to get everything cool doubt and Flatlined etc. Etc took me along time to get over that and to realize that. The goal is not to get rid of that stuff, the goal is to get rid of the unconsciousness. Coagulations and scattered nahs associated with that stuff that's the enemy. So we train away. The unlined fullness and then you can have you can have the Full Monty that complete eruption of thought and emotion. In the volcano of in. And it's not a problem at all. It just tastes like catharsis. Cleansing. So it turns out that to appreciate the cellphone world sensorially. As they arise in the present. Um. Key attentional skills for this task are the mindfulness tasks are the mindfulness skills. So I look upon this is one of our jobs. Um. What's another job? T. This stands for transcend transcend his Latin for go beyond. Go beyond appreciate form go beyond for what's that, well, we could philosophically speculate but that's not what we're interested in here? We're interested in app actual experiences. So. Can I describe in words? What is beyond form certainly? Will those words necessarily map on to every human beings experience not well in the sense. Yes, will those words map on to every human beings conscious experience. No. But as you continue to practice the words register. They line up, they register with your actual experience so it will be talking more about this. If I had to put it into words. Well, I could put it into words. A lot of ways, but let's just briefly. Say this. Um. That, which is beyond form. Is the source of form it's also the? Ultimate destination of 4. So moment by moment. Uh. How does our sensory experience work when viewed under the microscope of enormous mindfulness it works like this? There's nothing. But nothing is inherently stable because it's not this isn't a bleak nothing. This is the nothing that comes about when all the Yeses and all the nose needed to mold this, or any conceivable world. Mutually cancel out. So. Uhm it's inherently unstable. And therefore. Breaks apart spontaneously. So there's this special rich nothing that all the mystical traditions of the world talk about every single one of them and the the when I say mystical I mean, contemplative I don't mean mystical in the sense of like. You know. New AG kind of power round stuff, I mean, the classical contemplative based spirituality's that we find all around the world in every agent in every culture. Some People have called it the perennial philosophy because it just comes back over and over again. The cultures are very different. Often the Phyllis philosophes and theology's are very different. But amazingly all. Sufficiently. Attained contemplatives talk about the source as a kind of special nothingness. Nihill Parec Silentium. Nothing par excellence is as opposed to Neil Preventive am nothing. That's just an absence. These Latin words. You might guess are part of the Catholic tradition, which is part of Christianity in the Eastern Orthodox, they talked about. Apophatic contemplation OK, it's like. Nothing but it's a special now. Uh. Meister Eckhart talked about Nice Sound Hondola Cruise talked about Nila. Um. In Jewish contemplation, I in. I am which means nothing Aynor Iron not a non existence. That's the word that's used or sometimes it's another Hebrew word. I'm forgetting it'll come to me, OK how about Taoism. Uh in 1000, they talk about. Sometimes they talk about, she. Xu it's browned shoot first Tom which means vacuous. But more frequently, they talk about Gucci this is really great word. Gucci OPS. Bats belly. Who she Ji both rising tones? And if you write it in Chinese. Siri. Pretty all it means depolarized this literally means a poll like literally means a polar ridgepole. In a house. This is and then was without so a depolarized state and then how does creation come about when the depolarized state? Polarizes then you have tychy the great polarization. OK. Uh do you know how the great polarization? Right that really crummy. You all know that Tai Chi tool. The tool the diagram of the great polarization right. We in the West call it the Yin Yang, which is what it portrays because that's the great polarization expansion and contraction pulling apart. Interacting each containing the other some Watt even though their polarized. There's still Some hint of the original neutralization. OK. What is the? See coming Christianity covered. I. Taoism Oh boy * what else. Recover Judaism Islam. For now. And whoops. FANA. Now I'd really be impressed if I could remember how to write in Arabic, but can't OK for that means. Annihilation. Into the source. OK, what else do we have around the world like that, well Buddhism Shunyata. Uh. Yeah, I'm dumb. Narrow down which means the same as finance cessation and Hinduism Yoga for example, neuro to same word cessation. Uh. The yoga sutras began. Yogas Chitta Vritti Nirodha. Yoga is the cessation of the fluctuations of consciousness. So all over the world there's this sort of special nothing. Are you special kind of nothing? Breaks apart. So now there's 2 things. There's Space effortlessly spreading and space effortlessly collapsing simultaneously. It's two things it's not the one nothing. But it's pretty close to the one nothing. And in between the 2:00 so there's the one nothing. Which is obviously beyond form because it? There's no timer space inside of it, so how could you have a form? All that it breaks apart and creates a cleft. That that cleft. Is? A volume of time space. Volume of space time. And that spacetime experiences. The. Antipodal forces of expansion contraction and therefore, that spacetime vibrates. Into see here field. We 1/2, creating the impression of a self inside. The impression of self inside the other half, creating the impression of a surrounding scene. However. If you are able to. Still have one foot in expansion and the other foot firmly planted in contraction. While the self and seen are arising then you will not have completely lossed your connection to the source. Uh. So. There's nothing too. Get in the way of the 2 sides coming back together. Digesting that volume of time space self world. Back to the primordial state and then the cycle starts again over and over and over and over, so the extent to which you are able to be in contact with 0. Or be in contact with the 2 sides of 0, even contact with the 2 even when the 10 billion. Are arising in between the 2:00 to the extent that you are able to be in contact with the one nothing or the 2:00 doings to that extent, you are abiding beyond form, even though you may be walking through form talking. Two form driving your car. Inform. But not completely. Cutting the umbilical cord to your source. So that would be. Ah. Living Nirvana so to speak what I'm talking about is something that happens on the cushion. But ultimately something we want to be able to have happening us we're just bopping around. Taking care of business. So a person that's able to do that. Um. It is. Uh. Could be called a deeply enlightened person? OK, so appreciate forum appreciate that means appreciate sensorially self in world. Get over the self and get over the world. So there's only one verb left. Let's really appropriate to apply to self in the world or form. Appreciate transcendent, And the other verb is in proof. You may have heard the. Expression first there is a mountain. Then there is no mountain. Then there is a mountain? How many People have heard that. Sounds cool what the hell does it mean? Well, when we begin our practice. We can, we can be working on this will talk about this in some detail. We can be working on this. Up. We may get some sort of hints of this, but we're probably going to be mostly working on this because. Uh there's as we'll see as time goes on and see how our time is OK. There's complementary relationships between all these things but when you start out. You might be doing some loving kindness practice but. Mostly just observing stuff and if you're doing mindfulness practice and what's the stuff you're observing is just probably more or less ordinary stuff. Uh. So there is a mountain seems like there's the external world exists. It seems like there's something called a self inside. That's in relationship to that. Uh so there's a mountain. Then you start to get some hints of this so there's no mountain. Uh. At least occasionally actually quite frequently actually everyone experiences this. Just not consciously. That's why I said, well if you sort of live this way, you're deeply enlightened but The funny thing is anyone that. Doesn't live that way? They don't think of themselves as in light because they see that everyone experiences 0. But just not consciously. A dogs barking? And you listen to it, you listen to it, and then the dog stops barking. Moment when the dog stop barking? You returned to the source. Just for the dog returned to the source just briefly for a fraction of a second but. First of all People don't pay attention to it, and Secondly, even if they didn't pay. It did pay attention to it. It would seem like a Trivial Pursuit. So who cares big whoop the dog stop barking? But as time goes on one's palate changes when develops a taste for certain things. One develops the taste for moments of vanishing. You probably heard me say this each. Time you know notice anything, however, banal coming to an end. Each time you consciously notice that you've made. A deposit in your xen bank account. But then accountancy has a very strange mathematics, it's a nonstandard mathematic. First of all the account always equal 0, but but there are different sizes of 0. Now that's non standard mathematics, however, it was a couple people in this room with actual advanced mathematical training and for those of you that are in that category I will point out that. The set theoretic construction of the integers actually does sort of imply an Infinity of zeros because every pair of of of positive and negative integers taken together as an ordered pair. That's how you create the notion of polarity by an axiom in set theory called ordered pairs. Now I better stop right. I'm starting to get off on a riff here, but anyway, there are an Infinity of ordered pairs. The same thing 5588, ten ten OK, except one of them is negative and one of them is positive. Uh. The set of all mutually cancelling. Numbers are integers. Um. Set of all such things is is the #0 so the number 0 the bigger the polarity. The bigger the Gump. The bigger the deal that you can stay with it, stay with it, stay with it, stay with it, stay with it, stay with that stay with that stay with it, stay with it, stay with it Gaga. That's going to be a bigger 0 in your bank account. Um. So. What were we talking sorry? I stayed with it too long I got? No. The mountain first, there is a mountain then there is no mountain occasionally. Then there is. No mountain whenever you want. At which point you realize. Everyone experiences no mountain. They just don't notice it. Um so you can think of yourself is enlightened because you can't think of being enlightened as being so different from anybody else, 'cause you see the alignment at everyone. Whether they see it or not. So there's no button. Then there is a mountain Oh half Rican Big Mountain. For the rest of your freaking life there's a mountain. And that mountain is. Becoming an ordinary admirable person by the canons of the culture that you live. That is a huge mountain how you might think our experience nothingness on a consistent basis. Then. It's automatic that. You're going to improve the self in the world, Well, there's going to be, it's going to certainly make that job easier. A lot easier and it's certainly going to give you a proclivity to want to improve yourself. An improved the world, yes, but does it guarantee it. No, it just gives you the proclivity and makes it easier at least in my experience. Usually about 10:15 years after some sort of Enlightenment, you realize how unenlightened you really are. Um. And then you just keep working so let's say improve. South. And world. So how can we think of improving ourselves now mind. You you don't have to have this in order to start doing this, you'll notice that. But this is the first day of the retreat and we're working on this. I were noting things and we're doing, Metta Lovingkindness. So. Improve the self, I like to think of this with an acronym ABC. The ABC's of being an admirable person. Affect just a fancy word for emotion. Behavior that's what we do in the world our relationship with People substances. Cognition. What are our go to thought patterns are they adaptive rational? Or are they not that. So. Week. I mentioned that. CCNE. The Basic Skills of mindfulness are important for obviously important for appreciating the world. You want to your goal is to appreciate the food in front of you. Do you need concentration for that? Well, it would be very helpful if you could focus on the sensory experience of eating if you want to appreciate the eating do you need sensory clarity? Well, it would be very useful if you could distinguish different flavors and textures? Maybe notice your emotional reactions to it. What part is image? What part is the emotional body etc etc? Do you need equanimity? Well, when pleasure arises if you hold on for a moment. You won't be able to experience the next wave of pleasure, you experience a little frustration if you. Have things that are uncomfortable come up with taste that you don't like or something like that. If you have equanimity. They'll cause you less bother so to have an experience of appreciating your meal or appreciating another person or listening to music or whatever clearly our core skills are useful. You have to look at the infrastructure of sensory experience with a very stable. High resolution. Sort of microscopic attention in order to. See the fine level of how consciousness works zero. We have the one nothing. The 2:00 doings. The one nothing. The 2:00 doings the cycle. You need a lot of CCD to detect this and a hold your awareness on it. Uh. Same skills are used here. So how do we have our go to emotions be more in the love joy areas well. Habits. So habits are things how a habit is developed is we do it over and over again. It becomes a habit the Sanskrit word for Habitas Song Scara. Um. Ipoly pronunciation is some car so. Habits can be positive or negative. In a sense need to be free from all of them, but we want the positives to be influencing our life, but we need to actually break our identification with both positive and negative that happens here. But in terms of what we want to be manifesting in the world? How do we definitely want positive handles so? You can intentionally. Create a momentum of positive emotion through practices like loving kindness and a whole bunch of related type things so that's the affect. Cognition is sort of similar. Well, I OK now let's organize it on the difference house. What about behavior. Well, we can use nurture positive to help us work with behavior also we could visualize. A situation where we've changed the behavior and then we could have mental talk about how great that would be and then we can have pleasant emotion in the body and we could sort of use that apparatus to try to foster positive behaviors and in the same way we can use the same apparatus and by apparatus and I mean? what I call nurture positive where you choose a theme you choose one or a combination of the. Inner activities and then you create that theme there and you maintain that theme there so that it becomes more and more habitual and we can do the same with cognition. Let's say that you have a fear of flying for example. So then you can make the mental Matra flying is safe. Let's say, and you could have pleasant emotion in the body and then of course, when they gain say Nay say comes up. Now let's not say if I'm going to get killed for sure. If I'm o'clock. Then you just sort of let that have equanimity with that, you so you don't fight with it. You selectively attend to the positive and that could with time cause you to more habitually go to. Well, the reality. The reality is I mean look at the statistics the chances of being killed in an air crash are. I think much more than a billion to one considerably more than that, or less than that should say so. OK, so we can use nurture positive apparatus, which both develops. And our core skills and also represents an application of those core skills to a certain. Job or goal so we can use the nurture positive apparatus for this kind of thing for improving our self is that enough now that might not be enough. We might we might need other things. We might need for the behavior thing we might need us object if. Accountability and support structure like a 12 step program. For example, there might be other things that we would need so I'm not saying that this is all but it certainly can help. Also, when negative emotions come up negative urges come up. All negative thoughts come up. In addition to. Replacing them with their opposites, which is technically called antidote meditation. An was discovered by the Buddhists along long time ago, 2500 years ago, they talked about antidotes. But they also discovered deconstruction. You can use the focus in technique divide and conquer break negative emotions or negative urges or maladaptive thought patterns. Break them up into their pieces and then break those into smaller pieces until you experience the entire thing as just vibrating space. Meaning that you can deconstruct the opposites of these back into this. OK, so that's improving itself? How do we improve the world? Well. We could do material service. This is how we normally think of improving the world material save up. So what does that mean lot of things it could mean staffing. The soup kitchen you know archetypally or it could mean volunteering it can mean philanthropy towards. Those kinds of causes it can be working for social change. However, you conceive up that that social change should occur. Um. That's you know. People have different ideas about that. Uh it can also be material service the most common form of material service that most People are going to do is raising a family. That's a huge service, creating new humans and helping them to be able to have a good life. That's a huge improvement of the world. So there's that which is sort of obvious. Then there is what's near and dear to my heart, which is you could teach mindfulness? That definitely improves the world. Allows People to do all this stuff and then some of them will teach mindfulness you see how I can spread right or you can and or you support People that teach mindfulness or related things that's the data so, give us Donna but that allow us to be full time specialist mindfulness teachers. So you can teach mindfulness yourself and you can support People that teach mindfulness. That makes the world a better place for sure, and then you know, there's the obvious material services that People do. So I call this improve the self and the world.","title":"APPRECIATE, TRANSCEND & IMPROVE - OUR 3 HUMAN JOBS"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/auto-chant-or-auto-speak/","text":"id: auto-chant-or-auto-speak title: 'AUTO-CHANT' or 'AUTO-SPEAK' hide_title: false sidebar_label: 'AUTO-CHANT' or 'AUTO-SPEAK' Right. Most People. At least occasionally in their life have had the experience of. Just sort of starting to flap their lips and magically something self organized. I call that auto speak. Um so I wondered is there a way to sort of trained People so that that's more likely to happen in their daily life. So one way to do that is through a process that I call auto chant you take something that you're very familiar with some People use Mont Resource, Scriptures, but it can be anything that you're thoroughly familiar with and chanted out loud and you just sort of let your speech organs self organized so it's the auditory analogue of the auto walk now. We want the techniques that we can use in a secular context say in a clinical medical situation or in a school so we won't encourage People to use things that are explicitly religious or from a foreign culture. When we go into these mainstream situations. But I mean, if you belong to a certain religion or like a certain culture. You can chat things like Ohm, Namah Shivaya or? Oh money Padme home or um pattern Upstair Ave Maria. Whatever appeals to you. But in a secular context. I like to use something simple. So maybe numbers so here's auto chant by the numbers. 123456789 ten 123456789 ten 123456789 ten. Wonder they will rise eleven 8991 knew they were rising 11 eight nine nine one dollar. They are rising. Eleven 991 River rising 79 and 103 more wise eleven 89. Now I'm sort of tuning in to the fact that there's just air blowing across my teeth and tissues are flapping and they sort of know what to do and it's fun. I should say that in some religious traditions. They have what's called glossal lately out. And by the way that's not Justin Charismatic Christian things in North America. There are analogs of that. In other cultures. I saw it in Japan at Mount Koya. For example, and something like that happens in Sioux booed which is in Islamic context in Indonesia. This is what's called speaking in tongues now? What's significant about the Glossa Lalia. Or speaking in tongues is it's audible so actually there right. It is sort of the spirit now. Sometimes there's a belief that there actually speaking grammatical human languages like Aramaic or? What have you Unfortunately that is apparently not the case so but so the content may not actually be human speech but the contour is truly the spirit so there's a validity to that and it can be honored as that so that's Auto speak.","title":"Auto chant or auto speak"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/auto-everything/","text":"So taken together, I have 4 standard techniques for. Training People into what I sometimes jokingly called the Zen bounce or spontaneity or cultivating flow within your motor circuits. So one technique is auto move an it easy way to do that. I demonstrated sort of the auto walk thing. Another technique is auto speak in an easy way to do that is like auto chant the way to cultivate spontaneous spontaneity and thought is the auto think technique. I described that briefly this actually some more details but the good news on that is, I have a very complete. Blog in my blog spot where I talk in total detail about how to do the auto thinking technique, so that's a third technique, then often I'll use a strategy of having People work with individual elements and then having People work with the whole system so if you want to get crazy. You can auto everything. It means you try to taste your body moving while you sort of do some sort of chant. And you're you're covering your mind space and aware of a global une fixated state there. You're doing that all together, so that would look something like this one 23456123456789 ten 156789. Ten 123456789 ten 123456789 ten 123456789 ten. Take care.","title":"AUTO-EVERYTHING"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/auto-think/","text":"There's also a technique that I call auto think which is a way of training a person too. Uh. Think without thinking now you might say well, how in the world do you train someone into that? How do you train them use too? Talk to you how do you train intuition and creativity well? It's actually fairly. Involved procedure but I can give you just a brief description. It starts with something that anyone can do you track mental activity in terms of 4 possibilities? See here see here. Ann. Rest so see means you're having a mental image here mids are having mental talk see here means. You're having mental image of mental talk at the same time, and rest means that the system has not active your mental screen is blank in your head is quiet at the same time. Ah, or in the most extreme case, it means that both image space and talk space that vanished mind spaces collapse to a dimensionless point. But even if that doesn't happen. You can still be aware of breast or absence of activity. Which I described as the mental screen is blank in the head is quiet so that's a relative rest and you could also have absolute rest in your mind. Otherwise, your mind is active and that can only happen in one of three ways image talk or both at the same time, so you track that and then you get some momentum and then you can move to a more challenging procedure, which is to cover mind space. Play some attention in image space, some attention in Talkspace, Mindspace sort of has a front and a back images 10. It's a little more complex in this, but they tend to center sort of in front. That's all talk tends to be in the head of the year. So just like the body has a front and a pack your mind roughly speaking has anterior and posterior. Space and so you cover mind space and you just sort of Freud may be called it evenly hovering. There is that a phrase that he used so but he was talking about the outside. We're talking about evenly hovering on the inside so you cover mind space and that's actually. Not as easy for most people's noting the mind states meeting tracking image talk both or not. But if you're able to cover mine space that could be very useful and then certain window of opportunity might present itself. There might be a global une fixated state either. It's all rest. All the time or it's active but it's just a subtle vibration of activity or there are surface thoughts. But they immediately go away, so you never carried away. That's a global une fixated state now. If you maintain a global une fixated state. Um. It may evolve into a situation where you're actually thinking again. But the thoughts are just self organizing there just happening on their own and their creative and their insightful and now you're into a state of auto think you actually trained yourself to do that now that's a window of opportunity. If that opens you use it. But if it doesn't then you have difficulty covering the mind space then? Finally we just go back to noting the mind states so it's kind of algorithm that loops and branches and then with time will tend to induce in a person the ability to think without thinking or to have thoughts without a thought thinker that sort of self organized and Carrion Enerji of creativity and or insight.","title":"AUTO-THINK"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/auto-walk-demonstrated-by-shinzen-young/","text":"Really? So. I like to give People the option of practicing every kind of meditation technique that has ever been developed developed in the history of world mysticism. and I have this sort of grid where I classify all the techniques like a periodic table of meditation strategies, so I try to include in that everything that. It was a major invention or a major innovation somethings in meditative technology of only been discovered once many things have been discovered many times in different cultures. So one thing that as far as I know was only strongly emphasized once is the notion of expressing spontaneity through how you move? How you speak and the motor part of how you think. This is an aspect of liberation practice that was very much appreciated. And developed within the Chan School of Chinese practice, particularly associated originally with the master name mods who and that eventually evolved into the Linji or renzy as it's called in Japanese School of Zen so they put a big emphasis on. Manifesting impermanence manifesting emptiness manifesting non self in how you move the body how you sort of channeled the words that are coming through your lips and eventually also learning how to? Think without thinking so there's sort of like if you do without thinking it's just happening this and it's merged with the dynamic emptiness of nature, young in if you speak without thinking same thing. A little trickier is to think without thinking. But it's the same general idea, it turns into thoughts that are spontaneous creative. Wise and so forth so traditionally in Buddhism, they speak of the 3:00 Karma Dvora. The 3 gates of actions Kayavak Cheetah Archive at Man\u00e1 means bottling motions speech actions and thought actions so I. Have in my repertoire of techniques a quadrant of training that I call spontaneity training and I teach People how to access spontaneity and body movement speech thought and even all 3:00 at the same time, so my word just to have a convenient word for this just happening empty but rich dynamic quality. In motion that will work for it. I call it auto from the original Greek meaning spontaneous corresponds to certain Asian concepts. the Chinese notion of Iran, which is she's in in Japanese. And there's many words in Tibetan that have this connotation of effortless just happening anyway. I call it auto to have a word for it. So there's a technique of auto walk or more broadly, auto move auto speak and specific example of that would be auto chat, which is relatively easy to do and then I even have an auto think technique so the way you do. Or auto move is you just sort of tune into some motion that your body already knows how to do and you just sort of follow the reflex. You taste the reflex miss the fact that the motor circuits know how to do it without there needing to be much of thinking ego for it to happen. So it's like being a little kid little kids walk. They just walk for the fun spontaneity or they? Run for the fund spontaneity or they you know like play around in puddles of water or whatever 'cause it's just like. Just happens and they enjoy that just happening iness of it, so to do the auto walk you. Tune into the fact that your body knows how to walk without meeting are you. Um. And it's a little intuitive I can't really describe quite how to do it, but you just sort of get a feel for it with time in the monastery the way that People learn about this is by watching other People do it during the word periods or as you're walking from place to place People do this sort of just walking thing. The more senior monks and then you sort of pick up on it, so I'm going to show you my particular way of. Doing the auto walk and it's not I'm pretty poorly coordinated so it's not very going to be very elegant. But there will be a kind of spontaneity to it, so just sort of let you late Kerry. No, I said it defocus. The gays and it's just sort of happening and it's sort of fun. It's like you're being a little kid again. Now I add a feature that is not required, which is engaged the visual field. It seems In addition to this sort of my legs, not to carry me without me. As I'm moving, it seems like the vision visual field is expanding in front. But the thing that I just saw an instant ago is collapsing behind me. So it's like being a Boulis being carried in this funnel of expanding light. In front and contracting light behind and then I combine that with the sort of spontaneity of the movement of the legs and it's like space itself is just sort of caring is come along. I'm exaggerating now. This silly usually but you get the general idea. It's just so many expansion and contraction and the legs are just sort of move in with their own. Could just like playing like this for a long time and it's rich because it's dynamic. It's bouncy, but it's empty because there's no in there. That was me, making shinzen do auto walk for everyone on YouTube. Shin heads everywhere and tomorrow. I'm going to get him to do auto walk while auto talking auto speaking while auto thinking so stay tuned for more.","title":"AUTO WALK demonstrated by SHINZEN YOUNG"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/be-the-master-of-every-situation-shinzen-young/","text":"So we've been talking about this happiness independent of conditions. And we've talked about it from a lot of Points of view. Um. The. When? I first went into the Zen Temple after I've been on Koya for awhile I decided that. I wanted to. Experience training in the Zen tradition. Uhm I think I've been amount choir for 2 years. And I completed the what's called K go, which is the basic training in Xinggan That's 100 days in isolation. Um. So uhm. I went to the Abbot of the temple and I. I said. You know can I go away for the summer for 4 months to kill to to do the summer training at one of the Zen temples in kill to and he was not very happy about that actually but he said is. Well, first of all he scared me, he said he himself at once considered going to do this end training. But when he looked into it, the same People said because because you belong to another school. You're going to probably get beat up even more than us, he told me this story. Right so it's like. Oh, OK well. I still think I'd like to try it and then he said, OK, but. Uh just All I ask is don't come back here with a half baked knowledge of Zen and criticize xinggan don't come back with a half baked knowledge of sun and criticized your school wishing on school so I said, OK, I won't do that and he gave me permission so. I was like. Really scared 'cause it's like you're going to get beat up more than even those guys OK and they get beat up now beat up physical but it could also be emotional so the way I got into the temple. It was show Coco G. It actually Gary Snyder had practiced at Shoko Koji. Add earlier period. He even writes about it, you can. Find his writings about Rohatsu session at Shokoku Ji Temple. Shokoku Ji is one of the 7:00 Rinzai. Zen training centers in the city of kill Tal, which is the old capital of Japan, so anyway. Everything in Japan is done through show title. That means letter of recommend letter of introduction, so I got up at my Sal who helped a lot of foreigners get involved in practice in the early days. Was a friend of mine and so I asked him to sort of find a Zen Temple. You know that would take me and sort of do the set it up for me and he did so the. There's different things you have to do and I've told you some of the stories about little tests that they put you through it before they let you in but then once they lay in. They really like in. It was pretty cool. So one of the things that you need to be a Zen Monk is you need a copy of the Rinzai Roku so the Rinzai Rocco is the Japanese pronunciation of Chinese book. Lin Chi Lou. And Lou means a record. Alan G was a famous monk is the monk that started the Rinzai School Lynn G is the Mandarin pronunciation of Renzy. So these these are the sayings of Master Linji, who lived in the Tang Dynasty. So what happens is each morning. The Master of the Zen Temple, the row. She gets up and gives it a show based on this text and he reads it in sino Japanese what's called combo. He reads it in sino Japanese but it's absolutely impossible to understand by just listening. I I mean, simply impossible even if you were Buddhist scholar. You can't understand just by listening because there's so many words that sound the same in sino Japanese. So no Japanese has to be seen to be comprehend did so every Zen Monk has. A copy in Chinese of the rings. I broke this. The Sayings of master renzy so that when the Roshi is reading. In this weird pronunciation. You can see with the kanji you can see the character an characters and you can follow what he's saying so I needed a copy of the Rinzai Roku so obvious sensei gave me gave me a copy in it. It's really cool because it's not a modern printed book. It's the old style of woodblock printing in on the old style bindings the way they used to make books. Hundreds of years ago. That part of the world. So it's like it's like really, really old fashioned right so he gave me a copy of the Rinzai Roku and so I remember. I'm there an it's like the first night and I'm going to you know the next day. I'm going to start this little series of tests and I knew that if I pass all those tests and got in. You know. I was just going to be bossed around for 6 months. I was going to be like someone's slave. Um. So it was like. Really really scary and so I was sort of going through my stuff and organizing my stuff and I saw the. The Rin Sirok with them and she look book. That obvious and sent. Provided for me, so I could follow that a shows and so I opened it up. Just to look at it and he had calla graft. On the The. On the cover of the first page of it, you know before you get into the text like just the title page, he had calla graft in his own writing with a brush. For Kanji, And those are the kanji. And it just jumped I jumped off the page and into my heart. It's a phrase from one of the Zen Masters and what it means is. B. The Master. Of every situation. Now that's the literal meaning of these 4 characters be the Master of every situation. Zooey Shoney shoot or not. Um Switchel torch. In Mandarin Chinese. And I knew. Because I done enough study and practice. I knew what he was trying to convey. You might think. That UM. He was saying. You can tough it out. Uh. You know, don't let them get you down. Um one might think that that's What that meant but I knew for sure. That that's not at all. What he was reminding me of because I'd seen the phrase before in my studies? And I knew in this N tradition? What what it referred to and it referred to something very specific. Um when the Zen People talk about. Being the master. So the Master is the person that owns the house. They talk about host and guest so this also means host. OK so when you contrast host and guest I said master but it also means hosts person that owns the house. So. When they say. Be the host in every situation. Or be the master in every situation. This is an idiom that refers to a very specific. Experience. Yesterday I talked about. Um. A sense of compassion. Arising from wisdom. Because wisdom allows you to experience each person each thing really. Um as being molded. Moment by moment before your very eyes before your sight sound touch. Um. Expansion and contraction. Are. Loving. Your world into existence and you this is not a theory. It's not a belief. It's not even a feel good emotion. Its in your touch sight sound circuits. So you can't escape. It even if you would want to and who would want it. So you experience your world your inner see or feel is this sort of bubble. That's percolating up from the still point of the turning world and simultaneously. This other bubble is percolating up that is the flower or the person or the tree what have and it's like 2. The two bubbles A site. Gods thought balloons or something that I sort of like expanding and then collapse down and then expand out again now experiencing yourself. And the so called other simultaneously born from the same source. Is leads to a sense of connection? Um that leads to. Uh and effortless compassion, the quality of Mercy is not strained it fall off like the gentle rain from Heaven at Shakespeare, but he's talking about. A spontaneity. Adjust happening uless in ones caring so that's what happens when. You experience the outer world and the inner world. Both arising simultaneously and your experience them with the wisdom mind so there's. There's a on it. And there's a me. But they are coming and they're both arising I'm reacting uh. There's a self over here. That's experiencing and it over there, but I'm experiencing both of the mass sharing the same source. So that leads to a compassion on I thou relationship as opposed to an eye it relationship. Uh. However. There is another thing that can happen. It's similar. But even more challenging.

They don't have eyes but you're inside the activity called flower because you're doing the activity called flower and you're not for a brief moment 30 seconds or. Shorter or longer, you're the activity called shins and has completely flatlined. And the only activity that there is, is the activity called flower or the activity called.

Harris is on the Nightline right and I think ABC. Good Morning America or something like that right, he's like a Taco, but he's one of us. He famously had a panic attack on Camera all at some point in his career, which you can actually see it's on YouTube. It's like will be there forever right? That was his wake up call that he had something was radically wrong with his life. Major part of his recovery was to take on this practice mindfulness practice. But because he's in the position of being. You know prominent television personality. It's sort of cool for us, so he he wrote. This book called 10% happier. And he's got a whole program that goes with it actually is partnering up with one of my facilitators. Jeff Warren from Canada. There on tour now in the US sort of bringing the message of mindfulness says so cool that were that mainstream at this point anyway. That the title of that book got be thinking about my own life. So you know 10% happier and I started to calculate in my mind did the like of a thought experiment. OK, at my current age. What would the picture be? If I hadn't made that decision at the age of 25 two. By Hook or Crook Meditate every day of my life. What if I hadn't done that? What if I just been one of the million other things that I could have been. As a non meditator. So where would I be given who I was at 25. Extrapolating, where would I be and then where I know myself to be as the result of that decision. And. Objectively, I just had to say. It's it's not 10% happier it's 10 times happier. I mean, Object Ivli Easilly 10 times, happier or put the other way. I would be 110th as happy, which actually would be like pretty miserable so anyway, I encourage you in that regard.","title":"Being 10 TIMES Happier ~ SHINZEN YOUNG"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/being-a-generalized-mystic/","text":"OK so let's see here. Oh. How I went from? Being a monk to a non Buddhist. Uh. And how I work through my various issues on the cushion who gave me this question at which issues where you think he hoped that could be several Dharma talks. Pick one well now that's interesting we had, we have these. We have these teachers meetings where the Western Buddhist teachers, meaning the People teaching Buddhism in the West right. But that nothing to do with your ethnic origin, so called Western Buddhist teachers. We have these periodic meetings next. One is going to be in 2 years in 2015. And. In the past, it's been 200 two 150. It's probably going to be twice as big next time it's awesome. These are all full time teachers. So we have this we have this. Meeting as we do from time to time. And they took us through an interesting process. Called crossing the line. Anybody here know what this is. I see only like 2 or 3 People that's interesting I had never seen it. I don't know what is its origin? It's I mean? I don't know what? What would you even call it? It's And empathy builder. So what they do is you got this huge group of People. And they put a line in the middle of the room. And then they? Everybody is on like one side of the room. And then they call out. Different. Ways that People could be characterized. A wide range in fact, the whole range OK. Of things now this is I should say is. Done with like this huge confidentiality. Agreement thing OK. Everybody knows that nothing is going to be revealed you know it's like never to leave this room. And then People are safe to reveal who they really are. Within that group. Assuming they feel their safe enough to do that. And People start doing that and so it's everything it's. You know your how you think of yourself ethnically. It's how you think about yourself sexually. It's You name it. Have you ever been arrested. I was one of the few that costs were many of the Buddhist teachers. That actually been arrested about that was sort of cool. Let's see. Well, you know. Are you of Jewish origin while I was like absolutely? And we meet Jack and Joseph all ended up of course, like we just crossed at the same place that we also to hard. * Alta Cocker Jewish teachers like this point, so anyway, but it was also things like. Who believes in Reincarnation? Well, not everyone cross the line. Um, who considers themself a Buddhist. Well, the great majority crossed the line. But I didn't. And I looked around, and I saw a couple of other People, you can probably guess who they were like no way am I going to reveal any day, if you know anything about who writes books about what you won't have too much difficulty, figuring out who was left back there with me because I couldn't really. Say that I'm religiously a Buddhist. Or identify myself that way. Then. How would I identify myself well actually we we went through it yesterday? I'm generalized Mystic. With a scientific mentality. However. Absolutely. And hands down. The biggest influence on me is from to his tradition. There's no doubt about that. Why? Because I look upon the historical Buddha as the 1st and greatest mistake? To attempt to have something like a scientific mentality to sort of say that Hey. Mysticism doesn't have to be covered in mist that it could be logic and evidence base I mean. He obviously wouldn't use those words make puns in English, you get the general idea. He he was scientist like. And it was. Not an animal on it was core to what he did. So to me that's the model. Um. However, a Buddhist. Is someone that follows the Buddhist religion? Which has all sorts of Gredos and all sorts of customs? And. Uh I wouldn't really put myself in that category. I can think of at least 3 things that are pretty prevalent in the. In Buddhism that to me do not seem to be evidence based. Uh. Then I've talked about that on occasion and so forth so don't need to belabor that but I would say you know. I am certainly profoundly influenced more than any human on this planet. I'm influenced by the historical boot up. And I just think that it's the job of. Us too. Build on what he discovered. So. Anyway, that's so. But I wouldn't say I'm a non Buddhist OK. I'm just not say I'm a Buddhist I would say that. Well, the. There was once a Sufi Master. Who said I'm in agreement with one hundred conflicting theologists I agree with everyone in these 100 conflicting schools of Islamic interpretation. So. I think that's how I would characterize myself, I am comfortable in anybody's church. Uh I mean, really Catholic Protestant. Muslim Christian Buitres doesn't make any difference it, it all seems the same to me. I I I don't see the surface, I see the death. Uh. So anyway, there's that.","title":"Being a Generalized Mystic"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/being-confused-is-good/","text":"Are you fixated in confusion? There's nothing wrong with being confused?

I want a video of my view of all of you so just way this is the first female Dharma talk OK. So. So I would like to invite everyone right now to imagine that today is your birthday. You can do that. Alex is birthday was on Friday. Does anyone else have a birthday that's actually happening over here, so just imagine. But today is your birthday. How would that change things? Would you feel different about? What goes on if today was your birthday? How do you look at the day when it's your birthday? You think about a little differently right to different kind of focus. The special day. I'm going to talk about that kind of focus. I grew up in a tiny little town in Ohio, like 4000 people in our house was in the Woods. Ann I would go out. I loved to get away from what was going on in the house. I went out into the Woods. That was my refuge with my dog. I'm a dog person and on my birthday. When I was somewhere between 10 and 13. I can't remember anymore and by the way we have no speaker system so I'm projecting so if you can hear me at any moment just do this. And I won't assume you're saying it's good can you hear me OK now I don't know if I'm going to be able to look at you? The whole time, Alright It's my birthday, it is your birthday. So, just imagine today's your birthday and I'm going to tell a story about birthdays and that feeling you get on your birthday. So when I was somewhere between 10 and 13. It was my birthday and what was going on in our houses was it was a special day that I specially wanted to not be in the house for that day so for my birthday. I wanted to go in the Woods and get lost now in a small town when you grow up. Everyone knows everyone and you know every inch. Of the town so the idea of going somewhere in the Woods, and we had like there was a couple acres of Woods and there were some Woods over biopharm. I'd never been over 2 by myself at that age and the idea of being someplace where you didn't know where you were was beyond my imagination. So on my birthday for this time I went out with my dog who was also thrilled to be out of the House and we went in the Woods and I deliberately in few hike you know to keep track of where you are you always look back. So you know with the view will be going back I didn't. I looked down, and I was twisting and turning because I wanted to get lost. An I went all like this all the way and I finally got over to a part of the Woods that I hadn't been before and it was starting to get very exciting and I finally got to a place in the Woods and I stopped and I looked in all directions and I had no idea where I was or what weight ago. There was a little moment of fear, but it was thrilling. It was this and everything stopped for a second. I can't tell you what that was 'cause I was only. 10 or 11 or 12 but I just kind of Bast in that moment of not knowing where I was and then I just picked a direction to go. My dog was kind of happily beside me an in about less than 5 minutes. I knew where I was and I went home. 15 years later or so in my late 20s. I'm in New York City trying to be an actress which means I had no money and it was my birthday. And I wanted to get lost in the Woods. If you've ever been to Manhattan. Their Central Park and it's a lovely park, and I know every square inch of it and I know the one place. You can stand in the park and not know that not see any building, but you're still not lost in the Woods. So I didn't have any money. I had no way to get out of town in New Yorkers don't have cars. So I called everyone. I knew to see if they knew some place. I could go where I could get lost in the Woods and my little brother. It just graduated from Georgia Tech and he had a friend whose dad, who had a cabin North of Jasper, GA, which is North of Atlanta and they were going to be gone for this 10 day period and I could go down there for free. If I can get myself down there and so I was so excited and I got myself down to. Jasper GA and it's this little town. Rabbi talks like that, and says Price Jesus all the time, but they are happy and so I just saw. These beaming beautiful People and I'm going to get lost in the Woods and I did praise Jesus with all of them because why not I was happy to be there and I finally got to my cabin in the Woods and there was Orange Shag Carpeting. There was a fireplace and everything else was Woods and there was a little Lake there away from everything else. There was nothing else anywhere near it. And the light didn't have a path around it, but that's where I was going to get lost. So I would go around the Lake every day and there was no path so I'm climbing over things and it wasn't like my Woods. There was more brush and stuff, so I'm scraping and getting over and at one point, I'm hanging from this tree over a ravine that went down about as far down as that is high and I was hanging in there for a minute and I thought you know if I fall. No one will ever find me no one knows I'm here. No one on the planet knows I'm here was very exciting and I would make it around them. I made it around the Lake and back. It took me about 3:00 or 4 hours 'cause again. There was no path and I'm scraped and dirty and happy and I get back and I'm in the House and I brought cassettes of James Taylor, which tells you how long ago. This was an I had concerts of Steve Martin. Let's get small but I just wasn't in the mood for that and so I played. James Taylor and I lit a fire and listen to James Taylor all night and I did the same thing the second day. And the 3rd day, I just couldn't listen anymore. James Taylor and so I went around the Lake again. An I came back and it's silent. And this is the first moment, it occurs to me that never in my life. Have I been alone. I have lived with someone at all of my life up until this point. Uh in New York City. I don't know if you've ever lived in New York City. But if you seen the movie The Matrix and when Keanu Reeves character wakes up and he's in that thing and he sees that's New York City. Whoever did that. Obviously was in New York are coming from the Woods in New York City. Even if you are alone in a room. There's someone above you. There's a apartment above you an apartment below. You there's someone to that side someone to that side you are stacked up on stack to Ponce tax if anst active on stack to People so. And you can't walk out without a human being somewhere, I'd always lived with someone I had never an we've lived in a house in the Woods, but there was always someone else in the house. I had never been totally alone before and it hit me this 3rd day with no James Taylor and there's no TV and there's no radio and I'm alone in these and so it's just quiet and so I came back from my hike in the Woods and I built my fire and I sat there and then suddenly, I started to get this pain in my chest and it got worse and worse and I realized I was feeling this intense loneliness. Then I don't think I'd ever felt before and it was this pressure was this ache and it just got worse and worse and I thought I'd I had just never felt anything like this before, and then I started to cry. But then I thought well. That's stupid? Why are you crying lonely don't you know I like talk to my judged myself out of crime but crime still happened and then if you've ever seen. The Wizard of Oz. I use that analogy for everything but this time, I'll use it when the house pins and everything's going around the cyclone and you see all the. People going around as she spinning in the house before she lands and everything. It's like I saw flashes of all these things from my life. None of which were good. There was nobody. I was longing for to be with it was every fight every horrible thing all the bad things that happened to me and they were all flashing to me as I had this aching. Oh my God, the loneliness. It hurts so bad and I just take so bad and I didn't think you could take that that and it just. It just get more and more and, yes, Peacocks, it was like that. It was like a dying cat, but it was just I just didn't know you know, I didn't know what to do, I'm alone in this house. I plan to be there for 5 days. I'm only on the 3rd day and then I looked over at the fire. And it's moving. And it's alive. And I kind of walked over to the fire and I looked at it and it was like this living creature and I started to get mesmerized by the fire and I was looking at it and I spend a lot of time with fires. We have 5 fire places in my house growing up and I was looking at the fire and you know on the Top was the most massive part of the fire and down below's I was looking with these like down around 1:00 log when it a little individual flame would come up and then another. Individual family like these little individuals that weren't part of the massive the whole and I don't know if you've ever watched fires, but they're happy fires aren't sad and I was looking at. This fire as I was feeling the sake and the more I just kind of went into watching this fire. I became kind of hypnotized by it. It was kind of entrance by this fire, and I started looking at these little individual fires that were separate. They were their own thing and I've watched him and I. Watch the move and how they were happy and moving around and they were kind of like these living creatures to me and then I notice. These little creatures and they have their own life and their own dance and then if they had any opportunity at all. They tried to join the big fire, even though if they join that big fire. They disappear, they're Anaya lated they don't exist anymore. It's this individual little event and suddenly. It's just part of the big it disappeared for me. Hell was like someone, said Oh just like being a drop in the water to me that would be hell. I was in New York trying to be an actress right. It was like the fact that these little flames were seeking out other flames and they had this life and they were sacrificing their life happily to become part of the big happy. And I just kept watching this fire. This later years later, I refer to this as a fire meditation that. I did years later, but this was decade before I meditated and I was watching. This fire, and later on in the fire. I notice that I have become quite calm as I was watching. This fire, and then the fire started to get less and less than the fire had been my friend. It was like this living creature and I was watching it live and die. And be born little ones get born and then they would join the other and give up their lives to be part of this whole and then ask the fire got less and less, I realized that I was feeling. Quite peaceful and happy and instead of going in the bedroom to sleep that night. I slept in front of the fire and we went to sleep together and I woke up the next morning and it was a fascinating thing. The loneliness was gone. And I have never for an instant since that moment experienced loneliness. It was gone. And I in the last 40 years of my life, I have lived alone for 30 of them and I've never been lonely. In fact, I take vacations to be alone because I don't get enough alone time. Maybe it's 'cause I teach in Acton went on with People. I'm really with People an I call these things I called my People fast and I go camping. An I go and it when I came to California 92 is when I really started doing it. and I go camping by myself in total solitude usually on Top of a mountain, although for the last 15 years. I have a nice little spot up on the coast of California, where I get to watch the sun and moon set into the ocean from my sleeping bag and it's an environmental site. There's no one anywhere, and I go up for anywhere from 4 to 12 days by myself at least twice a year. Never lonely for an instant OK. And People when I tell them I do these camping trips. I usually get 3 questions. The first one, is or too afraid. And, of course, don't be silly. This is my refuge nature is my that's my room right. The 2nd question for some reason I don't know why everyone asked it. But what do you eat I have no idea why People ask that question and I used to just take whatever food I could have, but after I did a vision quest. Years later, which I'll tell you about in a minute, but a vision quest is a Native American ceremony. We spent 4 days and nights alone on a mountain with no food or water. And, of course, the alone on the mountain part is what they think of as a sacrifice. I'm good with that no food. I could go no water. You know you lose your mind a little bit on the 3rd night or I did anyway. But the reason I'm bringing that up in terms of what do you eat on your vision quest you have no food so you relationship to animals is quite different when you have no food right. Animals just want to know are you going to eat them or connected something you have right and I remember when I went on my vision quests. You know you're in a small 6 by 6 foot of space with no tents. You don't have a tent there and you're out me open and it's surrounded by prayer ties, which are you pray with tobacco when you put it in a little piece of cloth and you rap it up. You make a prayer with it in there. Your prayers and there's 200 prioritize. So, your prayers are surrounded by your prayers in this little. In this little open Excel exposed spot and they say animals will not cross your boundary that you know the wae looter will protect inviting the animals to smell the tobacco. But in any event. When I did my vision quest. It just so happened that I put my site in the middle of what turned out to be a 4 Lane Animal Highway. It was the only spot where two bridges joined so all the answer at night when it got night. You know the day I'm going isn't this wonderful and at night. Right here, the animals come in. They go stop. You know like what's there. Some big animal made a nest in the middle of their path and then I heard them all kind of gathering around going? What do we do I don't know? Do we go around with it and then I kind of made sounds like I wanted them to go about their business. But I wanted to about mine and they just realized there was an animal in their path that made a nest? What do they do and so I just started making sounds because I thought that I wanted them to know. Said I'm staying but I'm not interested in them so I Yonaguni. Yeah, this kind of did it and settled and then slowly then little once which is kind of go by a little ones. We go by, and I went to sleep with animals. Just kind of moving around during the course of the night and I love that relationship with animals during my whole vision quest once with someone just kind of come up and sniff and go by so People. Ask me back to my camping trips? What do I eat and I take very little food for that reason I like that relationship with Inns? There's a third question, I get when People say you know you're going up for 12 days alone on a Hill is what do you do? And in fact, Shinzen asked me what do you do but I said really you don't know what I do no I really don't? But I think maybe he couldn't imagine being alone on mountain. Maybe that was part of it, but one thing I do say whenever you want to ask me what do you do? I say I don't know, but that 12 days goes by like 4 hours. It just goes by like that it's gone. Now I have a different techniques. I do usually when I'm on the Hill. I'm sitting here and I'm looking at the ocean and I'm on a little jet of land that goes out into the ocean on the California coast so it's kind of like I'm at sea, like whales will be out there and I've got Sky. Moving all around and I've got the grass right here blowing in the wind and you know, I can see it right now in the trees are right here. And so there's this flow everywhere and I know I just. Sit there an watch flow until there is just flow and I'm not really there anymore. and I also know that when I get there. Climbing up because to get to this site that is away from other People. You gotta hike in and I take stuff. So it takes me. 4 hours of going back and forth and the Hill is about 45 degree angles. So I get this little kind of little cart behind me and I don't weigh a lot. An I put a lot back there, so the cart sometimes a little. Heavier than I am 'cause I wanted you know get stuff up there and so I'll have the cart behind me and so I'm bent over forward at a 45 degree angle. So my face. The dirt is here in my face, is here. Sorry my Madonna thing is moving and so I will literally go up the Hill that way. and I used to go into meditation and do see rust or see out or something like that, and then but what I now do when I'm carrying my cart who is seeing. Who is pulling I just do a couple questions of self inquiry and then there is just activity happening and I'm not really there right and so that's kind of so when I'm on the Hill. Everyone says what do you do it's like I don't know 'cause I'm not there I'm not there so anyway. The other thing I wanted to say is what I notice started to happen. These trips started is my gift to myself for my birthday, then they became something I had to do. It's like if I didn't do it that year. It was like I forgot. It's like saying, You forgot to eat or sleep or breathe or you know it was an essential thing. I need in fact, I'm going on a trip after this retreat for a week, but I notice something started happening. When I'm getting ready to go. I'm packing up to go for camping. I notice the minute I'm done fixing everything. I have to do in my life. You know you had to come on retreat, giving you the minute I start packing something would click an I was in ceremony. It was like I got it from my birthday ceremony. It was like it was my birthday. There was something about the packing and everything that it didn't matter if I was there or not. In fact, I've been there, so many times. I know every rock 'N' thing. I don't even have to go. It's here. It's inside me. You know, but the packing itself something clicked in and I was in ceremony and I was just happy driving up and it didn't matter if I was doing a meditation technique or not. This this kind of in ceremony thing would click in and happen and I didn't have the word in ceremony until after I did Native American ceremonies. That's where I learned that then I'm going to shift for a moment, too, so I was doing that here from 92 to 98. And I was having all sorts of interesting experiences from 92 to 98, some but I guess we would call mystical or spiritual experiences were happening, but I didn't know anyone to talk to about that. I was a New Yorker and if anyone said. Mystical or spiritual. I'd leave the room usually that I was a very cynical New Yorker. So I hadn't cultivated friends to talk to. In fact soon as this stuff happened is when I left New York. So I didn't even know anybody out here, so I spent 6 years with these things happening kind of creating my own system of what to do with them. And then I thought you know, I really want to talk to somebody about this and I just didn't know who knew about this and so I kind of go and this was before Google and Internet and you know you could call operators and ask them questions about things but they don't really know go on this Phone book and look at centers and kind of put my head in the door and they say. No, you have to bow to this person or you have to do this over here and I knew that wasn't the direct route, I wanted 'cause I knew where it was. I just wanted to talk to someone and finally I said, You know, I don't think I'm going to find anybody so maybe all meditated the idea of sitting still for 5 minutes. I thought it was one of the most ridiculous concepts. You could have and but I thought you know, maybe I'll do that. And there's something there, so I went down to the Bodhi Tree, which is this a spiritual book store. That doesn't exist anymore in LA and I asked the young guy behind the counter who had a Walkman again. I'm dating myself and I looked at all the books and it was just overwhelming and I said. I like to experience things I said Assyrian I kinda. Taper recording and he said over here, there's a 5 meditations by this guy named Shinzen Young and and I said perfect so there's 5 different kinds of went perfect. I can get an appetizer platter. I can pick which one I like. And so I went. I was house sitting for someone in Mar Vista. So I lit candles and I made a basket. That's what I thought you had to do to Meditate and then I got stoned 'cause I thought that. And so every night. I did one of these meditations and there was Karma Yoga and Mentre and loving kindness and cover law. I thought of Kabbalah, but it's not it's Qabala and and then the Posener was one of them and I really went out each one. I was like. Yeah, that's that works so well. Until I got to that vote possible one. I've got that is just a little too. Technical that one. But the other four were great and then I thought you know, but I come from a family of Teachers. My mom's a teacher my sisters are teachers, they're all like. Famous teachers in their worlds and so I thought you know that guy explains things really well. Let me see if I can find him. But I tried to find La Meditation Center and the operator was not helping me at all because it didn't exist anymore. Anyone Oh well and then about a month later. Some guy called me so do you know that guy that you were looking for? He's on KPFK now and I turned on KPFK and I heard him. He sounded older still sound like a woman. But he sounded older and I listened to him and they said. This is shinzen young for possible support Institute and I went all man of all those cool meditationes. Heat choosable possible problems. The technical, one, you know, but he was the teacher might you know when I went to college. I said, what should I learn to my mom and her mom both said. Just go to what the good teachers are teaching. I thought not listening to you. I'm going to learn just with the good teachers are teaching, but now I wanted a good teacher and he explained things well so I find myself in a first retreat. I've never sat for longer than 5 minutes in my life and I'm in a meditation retreat and everyone's got these mats in which it Holy Spirit up in Encino and everybody at the beginning going around in there, so long haul like he would be up here and it's a long hug and everybody wants to get up close, and you're all sitting around and getting their little what I thought were campsites. And they get their little campsites here and everyone had their campsite and they wanted to real quick get there and it really depended on where they were, and then they sit and close your eyes and they're closing your eyes facing a blank wall there's nobody here. And I thought, What does it matter where you are in the room and for your eyes look close. I didn't understand this and then Shinzen came in and then talked and was eloquently went that's the guy. Oh, wow, listening to him was so inspiring. He was talking about things I knew but with clarity and shining light on it, and different way. But then they talked about you know you talk about this are there was zabuton and a zafu and Yasa and so I assume this was a bow? I thought there was a sophomore, everything right and so on this retreat. Everybody is walking around when they're talking up to this retreat. He had been teaching is his meditation technique, apparently and by the way since then. I've done a 7 hour video interview with him of his beginning all the way up through the five ways. And for 20 years. He taught nothing but noting location of body sensation where you just sit there Goni. Elbow knows you know shoulder that was it and at this retreat. He was doing talk image field and everyone was freaking. The F out they were like? What are you doing? Can we just please go back to noting location of body sensation and I didn't know what any of it was right. But first timers we had to go on a room in count 1:00 to 10:00 and you had to visualize the number one say the number one and then do it on your breath so you're feeling a bra. Seeing and hearing the number one and we had to go 1:00 to 10:00 and I thought that was the stupidest thing anyone had ever asked anyone to do and I looked around, and everyone's like Oh yeah. This is interesting and I thought. I need to leave this room now OK. I thought you know, I'm just going to listen to him when he talks. You know, I have something I can do with my eyes close is good and then I'm walking down in everyone's fluttering to sign up for something called an on line, where they go in some room and talk on the telephone. No thank you and I'm going down the Hall and there was only one man. I talked to the first day. Michael Michael Baessler. You might know and he was walking down the Hall and he was going in one of those roots and he pulled me aside and said did you sign up for one of these and I went no and he said. You really need to do this and I went. It's OK. I'm good and he went he said. No, you take mine. And he just kind of thrust me into that room that moment kind of changed my life. So I'm going in this room. I'm putting on a headset going. This is so weird. This is so weird. And I'm sitting there looking around? What are we supposed to do and then shins in Congo's Michael and I said no this is Stephanie Michaels had me come in instead of hitting 10, so how is your practice I've never meditated? I said, I'm a new person and he was Oh, so do you have any questions and I said you know actually? I do you know this whole talk image feel thing you know? I teach People? How to juggle? I know how to do I know how to get 3 things going. I can do that. So it's not that I can't do it. But what is the point I mean, it plus it's so technical it feels like playing scales. I was an oboe player I stopped because I hated playing scales. I just wanted to play the music. And he said. You know it is playing scales. But the music is your life. Good answer good answer music is your life, I stood in one, she don't want to do it, but that was a good answer impressed with that and then I said. But. You know, I can close my eyes, I had a spontaneous experience about a year earlier. That happened to me and ever since then. All I had to do was close my eyes. Everything dissolves into this light that is everything. There is no me. There was no effort anything. An I can. Just go to that. And when I open my eyes. I have barely beaming down everyones beaming down and I see how that light is really all the Tier 2 and it fills me with love and everything through the world I said, I can do that. You still think I need talk image field. And he said, and People whenever I told that to People they go Oh you're going to a blissey place. And I thought that seems kind of condescending I go can you close your eyes and you know, but either way, and I said this is what I do People have told me it's a blissey place and I said, you still think I need talk image feel, and he said. There's going to come a time when the Doo Doo hits the AC and you're not going to be able to go to that blue place. An I said yes, I am I said, I can do this anytime. I want I've never not been able to go to a * place and he said. No there's going to come a time when things happened circumstances in your life and that will not be available to you and then what do you do, he said I'm teaching you techniques to be able to work with your sensory experience in a way so that you can optimize anything that happens in your life. Another good dance. And I said, OK, Alright and so he said, so try it and I'll get back to you in 25 minutes. He had 5 people in the room and then OK so I went OK. That was a good answer, Alright I'll try and I started doing it in about 4 minutes later, he comes back online. And he says can you teach anyone? How to juggle an I said, Yeah. Pretty much he said. Can you teach me how to juggle and I said well Have you ever played a ball sport and he said? What's that? And I said Have you ever had to take a ball in a mid throw it in name? Where it goes and he went Oh no and I'm really spastic. Ann I said, OK, well, then it'll take longer, but you know about that, so after that retreat. Over the next 3 months about 5:00 or 6 times. I am over it. Surely Fenton's house, she's in bed. Shintens here, an I am teaching him? How to juggle and I'm saying no no no no no no put your hand here put your hand here into my hand so if I'm here beside you put it here. So I'm in a teacher mode to him and he's going and then one time he got like a flash. We just kind of throw 3 and catch them and I said that's a flush and **** anyway. First I didn't price and I thought wow. This is the same man that gives those amazing Dharmatala. You know, and so I had a different relationship with him from the first moment right so anyway because of this relationship with him and when he asked me to teach him to juggle he said. Then I will meant are you in your meditation practice, so he would call me on the Phone all the time and say so. How's your practice like? Well, you know? I'm doing this? And this and I ended up marrying. The Man\u00e1 set next to it. The first retreat and he'd been wishes in 7 years and he said. You know shins on his never once called me to ask me about my practice and I said, Yeah, but you're not teaching him how to general. So then Shinzen takes me to a Sweat Lodge, Sarah. OK and we're going to go to a sweat, Lodge ceremony. You talk about a lot OK and they talk about how hot it's going to be and I'm really good with heat and I'm in the back seat of the car with him in another man built insurance ends in the front see pounding so loud on a drum and howling in Yokota. You know the songs going isn't this great and you just going on and on and on the whole car is Raveling with this and then they stop and they turned you sure they go Oh yeah, wasn't that one hot and yeah that was yeah, we really. Purif ride on that one, you know, and they were just talking about this heat and I'm getting kind of nervous. You know, I just want to know if I'm going to survive little things like that. And so I kind of mentioned I go? How long actually are we in there and you know, I'm going to little nervous about this and shoes and turns around goes all your nervous then your ceremony has begun. The ceremony has reached forward in time and grabbed you by the belly button. And I said excuse me and he said. If you're focusing on it, you're connected to the ceremony already and in that moment. I remembered what happened before. I went camping. When I kind of want in ceremony before I went camping. I was there except this was more of a sense of dread and fear and that kind of stuff well. Finally we go to the Sweat Lodge. An I love. There is a fire. It's around a fire. I'm happy I like fires, and there was a fire there and their sage and it all smells good, and we go inside a lot. And I'm behind him and and then they come in and these red hot rocks come in and it's Oh. It's like primal. It's so cold. They put him in the centre. They bring him with antlers you know, and then they bring in the walk on the water in a big bucket of water and they closed the door and then the rock clothes and then they take the water and then they start to sing. He singing a song and he throws it on the rocks and wherever he supposed to water on the rocks. It goes black there, so the light starts going up. And then he throws it on 3 times from here. This is the is the water hits. The rocks and then suddenly, it occurs to me that water and rocks will be steam. I'm great with heat. I'm great in Cenis. I can't breathe in the steam room. I don't do well listing. No one ever said the word steam for some reason, it never occurred to me that we were going to be sitting in steam heat. Yes, good steam. No, I am panicking and I'm going to shoot. This is going to be steamed. This is going to be steamed. Internal talk does running amok and then suddenly this big wall of steam hits me and Enveloping. You just like and I think I didn't breeze for a moment and then there's a little hysteria in my head, but the steam kind of kept me going for awhile and Shinzen warn me. Whatever you do, don't you good out. This lodge early because you're representing me OK. And he's right here in front of me like I'm right here with the rocks and he's right there and I'm like why am I doing this, I'm going to die. This is the end of my life as I know it right and I can't you think you can't breathe right. So I make it through the first round and then they lift the flap and I know there's going to be 3 more in these so I went OK. I survived that one, I can survive 3 more. The 3rd rounders, where they don't sing and all they do is sit there and put the water on the rocks and all you hear is the sound of the water. And the **** going on the rocks and they do it and that's the purify round where it gets so hot, I sat there in my ears were singeing and then it literally. I started getting goosebumps, all over my skin is if I was cold and I literally sat there and then suddenly. My mind stopped it was so hot, my it just like the Heat just went from. And I was in a suspended period of no thinking for the first time in my life. It was amazing and so after that, I thought OK that was interesting. We had another round. We came out shinzen and villain are getting in the car and I just feel euphoric. I'm just like wow. That was really great and shins and said yes. That's the taste of purification and I went OK and he said yes. It's in and eat pizza purification long and I love this ceremony. They had where everyone came with this focus and they had a way of talking when you're in the lodge. They had a uh a way they do activities. Everyone's focused comes in and creates this ceremony and this purification and in that lodge if you cry in that large that's a blessing to the ceremony. I thought This is so freaking cool. I fell in love with it and I did sweat. Lodge every week for the next 6 years, except on nights that women can't go. You can't go on your own time so but other than that. I was there every night for the next 6 years. I thought that was kind of the greatest thing in the world. And then When I after that, then I did a vision question that I told you about a little bit and one thing I want to say about the vision quests is that? Shinzen kind of tricked well anyway, how I did the vision quest is another thing, but one thing about a vision question being out in nature, and that ceremony and that's another ceremony where People commonly support you and they have that kind of special focus on it. You're sitting in one spot in nature, watching the sunrise go across the Sky and down all the stars come and it comes up again, but the time you're 60 will spent about 22,000 days on this planet and rarely do you ever stop to just watch one of them? So the vision quest is where I learned that time would shift. It was three days but it was like time opened up and there was more time. So my camping trips after the vision quest. I stopped moving before that, I was hiking after my vision quest. I just sit there and I don't move for 12 days and I don't need much food. When I'm not moving but that ceremony so the sacred ceremony of the sweat. Lodge and that's when I started calling my camping in ceremony and this notion of being in Sarah when I started using it in my life going. I'm going in ceremony now. Everything I do now will be sacred. There is a certain kind of focus in on it, and I usually light a candle to remind me, I'm in ceremony. Um one thing, though I will say when I camp alone there. What there there were maybe 4 occasions. In 20 years where I did cautions. And one time I called Shinzen, I was out on the Hill looking over everything and I decided. I wanted to hold all visual auditory. Insta matic experience at the same time, but keep them separate and distinct and this was before see here feel this is the five ways where what we were rocking and rolling on it. And so I said, I want to spatially hold them. All I was a very ambitious meditator. So I went OK feel is easy is in the body got a sense of that see it was before seeing if it was visual was easy 'cause. It's here and it's all forward here was a little Turkey 'cause. It's here and it goes out to the site so that space of here to hold both here in and here it was a little trick here 'cause. It went out. Inherency kind of crossed over a little bit here, but I did it and I got to. They had all of them at the same time, and then I treated it like a 3 dimensional pizza and I wanted to cut the cheese. I wanted to really draw a line between us. So I had distinct lines between all of them in cutting around the body was easy between C and here was a little gnarly and I would just I was really. I was in deep concentration that I was really and I finally and I was just at the edge of cutting the cheese on seeing here and then I did it, I cut the cheese and then all three of them flew apart. See flew out there here flew out here body flew out here, leaving nothing in the centre an? I mean, I'd experienced the source before, but not that way. And I went that is so cool. I have to caution then I have to tell him this is what we should teach everyone. All you have to do is A3 slice pizza visual auditory cinematic cut the cheese and so I cautioned down on the phone and I say This Is It. We're going to do this in cut the cheese and he went. Uh well here's what I see is an issue without he said. Everyone's not going to be able to hold all three spaces and. Some People are going to find it difficult to as you say it cut the cheese and he said. And I'm quite happy with the five ways right now? I really think that is the way we're going to go and I said that this is just three things they can get they could even take him a week. You know, and he's like thank you. But I think I'm good with the fire boy, he and I was disappointed and I watched my sensations, but I went back and I thought that was the most novel thing in the world so. What 4 years later 5 years later when he came up with see here we always like Siri because at that time feel was just emotional so I called it seeing hearing body is what I called it but basically it was called the 3:00 slice cut the cheese anyway. That's an example of that ceremony. Then, after doing my ceremony. In doing the sweat. Lodge ceremonies for a long time I started seeing retreats is the ceremony. And I thought you know it's really interesting. We all kind of come. It's sacred. Everyone is bringing their focus is one thing about the Native American ceremony. Everyone brings their focus, but everyone's working on their own thing right you cry for you. We all get bust by that. And here I thought everyone's coming. Everyone is working on their own thing, but yet were supported by the group and there was something kind of sacred about that and I started seeing retreats is it kind of kind of ceremony and then. Then I started to see how the ceremony held it's like in the sweat. Lodge ceremonies you know the drummings there and everybody the whole ceremony itself kind of supports you kind of in the way Tiens. I was talking about this. Then you do that and then that kind of movement support you in that way. and I started seeing how this kind of supported us and everyone has a time on retreat when you're you know you can't get focused or you're getting emotional or your knees or butt hurt or you think you're doing the technique wrong or someone in the Zendo. Is moving or eating a sandwich or something right and there's just something going on? That's a challenge and there's always somebody who's doing their own practice. But it's inspiring right so everybody's own practice contributes to this kind of whole ceremony that we can do and as I started seeing that as a ceremony when I came I started packing for retreats in the way I did for when I was camping. It's like I'm a ceremony now an I'd come and I'd listen to a Dharma talk and even if it was like Oh. I'm too busy. I didn't stop your life to come in and then after the second day, I'd listened and I go. This is the most important work we can do you know all that other stuff I had to do this really, really important that have all these lists that are going to do when I get back. This has to happen first. If everyone on the planet was doing. This there would be no problems right. I thought wow. This work is sacred. You know what we're doing. We're not coming here in gathering around of fire. We're gathering around this brilliant man who's created of vocabulary. An and uh vocabulary and terminology for sensory experience, so we can talk about the most subtle in deep aspects of anything and communicate about it and we can tell him what's happening in his teachers. We know what's going on with somebody and we can share this language and be able to help People and I'll just say as a teacher on this Richard getting a good workout, but I will say. The joy is a teacher to use his system is a teacher. The effective result of it is. Unlike anything I mean that newcomer group that didn't just have newcomers. I mean, you guys Rock You know it right. I mean, the reports of what they were doing with things that most people I know weren't doing till the 3rd retreats. They were pressing Oh yeah, I had this huge feeling and I let it go through and then I felt I was just like Rock and roll. We do high fives for that stuff, but it was, I really like. At this retreat, I appreciated having this to work with to help People honoring it. But I also and in my life with People who don't notions on system. I'm using his system to help People rewire habit patterns of thinking feeling behaving to help them suffer lesson be happier. You know, but they don't know the system so here People are coming in with these advanced questions of depths of the system so I got a good workout. I haven't had in a long time and I thought wow. It just made me feel so like I'm doing something I'm supposed to be doing and then I thought I'm not meditate here. I can teach here they're kind of the same thing except one I'm talking more right like the fulfillment. The Moody to Oh my gosh. This is Moody tell city here at the moment and you know what that is. And so anyway, I was just feeling this gratitude for this, this man who is created this. Vocabulary in this system. Of categorising sensory experience and giving a strategies and techniques that are the yellow brick Rd to the source and happiness. And. There is an infinite variety of ways within their system you can take. You can go whichever way feels good for you all roads lead to the source and I just always every time I'm teaching it every time I'm working with someone who's getting a has an and shifting I. I feel this thrilling kind of excitement ingratitude. That's kind of like how I felt on my birthday ceremonies right with this that. We're all kind of coming together and and and also the other thing that he developed is this. Interactive meditation who else does that. That's like exploratory surgery someones meditating you can meditate with him and interactively. Whatever is happening, they've got an expert guiding them. Where to go, which is what he does a non lines but his teachers we learn how to do that? What a tool for helping the planet? So, sometimes were challenged and we can get inspiration from those that are sitting longer and other times, were sitting here inspired with gratitude. And we can come here and an? Get insight. Into how we are born in each moment. The waves. Come in and go out in between them, the foam is created and that's us. To quote him, we were born in the cleft of expansion and contraction. In each moment. And we come here in this ceremony to share this. And if we're born and each moment. Then today is your birthday today is our birthday. And I. Wish that your I hope that your birthday ceremony. Contributes to you. Becoming a better person. And experiencing happiness. Independent of condition. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Thank you.","title":"Being In Ceremony ~ Stephanie Nash"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/being-known-to-death/","text":"How about if we took everything as our object well that's actually not that much bigger than my body just sights and sounds.

That there is a certain kind of dynamic vitality in the Zen style of enlightenment. It's just a style, it's not like. You know all wells. Zen starts where all this other stuff and it's not that way, at all. I think that's just BS to claim that but the way that the People express' enlightenment in their actions has a kind of bouncy vitality to it that spontaneity that is the result of a certain style of cultivation. That's where I see the strongest impact of style. People can get enlightenment, doing vipasana practice and sometimes it's a sort of inert enlightenment, it that it's great compared to non enlightenment. Crime rates, just open person, but there can sometimes be a kind of flatness to it not imaginatively just saying sometimes. Whereas the Zen People had this sort of bouncy experience of nothingness that they're able to convey what part of the practice of this is the lifestyle. Zen lifestyle where C basically if I were to contrast free puzzle Enzen Gross oversimplification. I would say that in Vipasa, not you, you observe your experience 1st. And you come to an experience of the flow of impermanence and then maybe somewhere down the line. Maybe you begin to ride on that flow of impermanence in how you speak to move in the world in Zen before you realize the impermanent nature of experience. The lifestyle is forcing you to ride on impermanence because you have to run around and stop on a dime run around like crazy stop on it run around like crazy stuff, I don't die. OK and sounds like my life well, no because in daily life that just leads to phonetic. Nesson, confusion, but within the context of Zen training if it works out well. It leads to an ability to manifest and disappear manifested disappear. In your actions and then with time you come to experience that as being the nature of experience so you sort of act it out first and then realize it. Kind of this so employers it be possi not you realize it. And then maybe right on it or maybe not so the advantage to the Zen training when it really works is that it guarantees. This dynamic expression of Enlightenment, the possible disadvantages because it is in some ways sort of like daily life. Maybe if it doesn't work. All it's going to end up doing is making you phonetic and confused so there's advantages and disadvantages that be possible way of working. May not lead to the vitality, but it's like a paint by numbers kit. It's likely to at least we do something like a work of art. Zen is something then it's sort of like here's the canvas. There's the paints now do it. But when it works. It has a stemming vitality to it, but you may not find in the paint by numbers kit.","title":"Bouncy zen vs paint by numbers vipassana"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/can-ordinary-experience-count-as-meditation/","text":"An art for example, piano playing or the martial arts or dancing, they might approach the art in a way that not only do they become extraordinarily focused while they're doing their art. But that there's a carryover into daily life and they notice month after month year after year as the result of having done that art in a certain way their base level of focus in daily life has changed so even though they're not. Calling it meditation, it is defacto a meditation, so if I do that. I don't have to actually do regular meditation. I can just do my ballet or piano, yes, but there's a tricky point because the issue is not do you become extraordinarily focused while you're doing the endeavour that's not that uncommon? What is much less common is that there is a carryover? And you notice in daily life in other activities that because of the way you're doing your art that every moment of your life is being informed by an elevated sense of focus. That's fairly unusual, but that is then and the art of you may have heard that expression. Zen and the art of archery, Zen and the art of flower arranging to zone 2. Yes, or no yeah, it is yes in the sense that there is this locker room or sports term to be in the zone and that is the term that's used for entering a state of extraordinary concentration say during your performance of sport and of course, it's highly desirable baseball player Ted Williams used to say he knew he was in the zone when he could see the pitch. Coming at him. You could see the stitches on the ball and those pictures come it like 100 miles an hour right so sports People call that in the zone. Once again, it's not entirely uncommon for somebody to quote enter the zone during their performance. What is uncommon is that they do it in such a way that there's a carryover into daily life there has to be the carryover. Remember I defined the common denominator of meditation is well not just concentration, but your base level of concentration when you're not trying to be concentrated? What are you like in daily life to count as meditation something has to? Consistently elevate your base level of concentration. So anything that does that is a meditation whether it's called meditation or not, but it's not just a matter of you get concentrated while you do it. It's a matter of you get concentrated while you do it in a way that it retrains your ordinary. Perceptions so that's what that's why I'm very specific about elevate your base level because it's not uncommon that a person will become extraordinarily focused in some endeavour it is. However, relatively uncommon that that carry over into daily life in a dramatic way that grows consistently with time without special instruction, usually that doesn't happen. They just have it spontaneously. But there's not the that's why you actually do these formal meditation techniques and practices because that more directly elevates that base level. Yes, the In other words, Let's imagine based on your. Line of questioning that there could be some ordinary activity. You're doing as a meditation and then there could be some special exercises that you do that usually involves sitting still and focusing in some way and whatever and you do those now in either case. You could have an elevation of your base level of concentration and that elevation needs to grow dramatically with time. If that's the case that either of those counters meditation, but usually People that get spontaneously focused. In less somebody points out to them that it is necessary and possible to carry this over in daily life. They usually don't so it becomes a dead end and it's not really a meditation, even though they may become very much in the zone while they perform their sport are there art so in theory, you don't have to do systematic formal exercises that involve sitting in that kind of thing in theory, but probably probably if you. Want to do it through an art you probably will still need some coaching into how to make your art carry over the state of zone do you coach People? How to I can do that? I can coach, a person to make their running or their singing? What have you can coach them so that they get the carryover but more typically? People. Will also do formal meditation practice sitting in silence, and so forth so The upshot is that the common denominator of every form of meditation around the world inside or outside of religion would be that they elevate base level of concentration.","title":"Can ordinary experience count as meditation"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/catching-a-free-ride-and-stephanie-nash/","text":"Yes, in terms of simultaneous expansion and contraction something that I realized just in the last day or 2.

When they occupied the same place at the same time, so you can have these 2 ghostly waves. One flavored fear the other flavors sad and there, so did dancing except in unlike physical dancers. They parts of them even all of them can occupy the same place. So they? They're constantly waving and the waves pass through each other without disturbing each other without developing pressure areas where they would clash does this metaphor makes sense. Yeah. Have you attempted to do this with the fear and sad not in this not this round. This may be the part of the missing piece because you could get them individually default. But then the next step is collectively default because if they both flow at the same time, interpenetrating wherever they need to without interfering then. They won't multiply together into over well. And that so the ability to have more than one flavor. And to separate the flavors have all the flavors flow and then have the flow fields. Interpenetrate without interference is a sequence that I take People through when they're going through big challenges that are. That are Poly Chromatic. IMO at the Poly Chromatic. Body distress, meaning a lot of different colors in the body then we need to train. The colors to flow through each other time and into Kingsley Dance. It's an interesting. Intimacy between them. It's like they're dancing through each other as well as with each other and to the extent that they're both flowing. You'll get an even more powerful flavor purification and and hopefully a significantly deeper sense of relief. Cape Cod House at coming. Uh. OK. Pretty much. When I when I can. Allow them both to share the same space and not and I'm recognizing how I've been keeping them separate and keeping the line between them in an when I allow them to just kind of do that. The kind of joy. I talked about before with the fear it's very intense version of that and then it kind of seems to ignite this kind of PT like enerji up the body and it gets very hot but it's getting. It's it's in Rapture Rifier itself is rather counter intuitive facial expression proves it. Yeah, it's really interesting because, as it does, I find myself wanting to comment on it, and I'll go up and talk a minute and then and then it loses it a little bit, yeah, and you have to come out to be done purely in the yeah. The the comments and then it does triggers of little tacos to go visit there. All about it in your use of practice allows you to say that in not sort of go down that yeah well. Pressly's motivation to kind of stay with this, it's kind. It's it's intrinsically rewarding no next step. See if you can have the fear in the sadness. Dancing with, and through each other with your eyes open. And he may find be focusing the eyes initially. Helpful. So we can maintain it somewhat into more ordinary experience. It's interesting when I am. 'Cause I kind of go in and out here as I do it and I'm going to talk all keeping my eyes open, but I'm getting to where I'm horning in on the one specific place in the body. They both share in a powerful way an if I can just kind of keep track of flow there, letting it be, whether it's red or blue you know. It. It kind of helps maintain it with my eyes open.","title":"CREATIVE WAY to ZOOM thru INTENSE EMOTIONS"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/dave-vago-shares-his-mind-board/","text":"Death is Aboard ha ha. Yes, rains, definitely aboard an writing. And here is Dave Vago. This is his board. Now, who are you. No one really no one, I mean? What's interesting probably about this board is? Just represents some persons thoughts from the past year or 2 that you know sort of gives you a sort of an external scratchpad in which to sort of put your all your thoughts into one place. Sometimes it's nice. It's easier to put it, there, then keep it in here right. So what you're seeing is yes, exactly that it's things that have happened in my sort of head for a long time. But we really just start here. But this quote appear is happiness is unintended side effect of ones personal dedication to of course, greater than oneself. That sort of. I think being on the Top sort of fuels. The inspiration and then so let's see we can start anywhere really what is mindfulness. This is something that I've always asking myself if you got a few different versions of what other People have said it is either self regulation and Prince present centered awareness. Other People have said Oh it's well. It's actually intention attention and awareness and so using that I've tried to build upon them come up with my own ideas, which are in different areas that didn't fit on the board have been put in different parts of this room, but they sort of relate to this, if we go to what's happening in the mind when? No one is meditating for example, these are just two modalities that you can sort of a rise in people's minds is really talking about what happens if you start to understand how objects of one's attention, either visual or auditory arise. We're going in and instead of a usual time usually goes in that sort of linear horizontal plane. But here we're doing a vertical plane so. Time is really going. Down in this direction. So something arises a visual object that mental sort of image there rises and then it passes and so you're able, it once you're able to refine your meditation techniques. You can start to really notice. The change between arising and passing and then eventually you get to a point where you can see, things gone, or Banish and this can all be actually related to flow flow sort of. Can be experience flow flow sort of the dynamic changes of seeing things moving and Rippling in time throughout the entire process. So it's not static. It's not there's a constant change going on and actually so really this is a dynamic board to this change, so it's just changed. It's really rest were started airing this flows. Relates to this whole. Sort of process can be in flow, but you can actually wants something banishes. Then you can actually rest and observe what's happening at rest and then if something all disappears. Then you can have cessation? Which is sort of the road dot so the real true gone. The Big G gone. Big tease that would put versus Little G, which is just the absence of that thing being there anymore. But the big G is something that's like complete absence of self and all the strands that make up everything. And consciousness, but The other thing really, that's worth saying about this is that also relates to what we're going to sort of define as to what is mindfulness and then I guess we consider it sort of move this way again this part of the brain is probably one of the most critical pieces. We think for what's happening here because what you don't see here you see see and hear but there's also a sort of semantic or viscerosomatic, an aspect of of what's happening. And that this was a matics sensation of what's happening inside put in like a feeling in the body for all motion comes from this structure here. This is called the insula. It's located sort of deep within the folds of your brain so if you just open up prop here is the brain, a brain so if you open up the fold here. Actually, it's probably better for you this way. Open up default. Here's the lateral fissure. I mean, just open it up. You'll see this and so that's the insula. What's so cool about it is that it represents sort of the whole internal sort of feeling states. From very primary sort of sensory sort of information represents things like homeostatic motor function going on in the more posterior aspects and then as you move more interior you get these environmental sort of things going on in the body and then you start moving through the more human like things that are very unique to humans in the interior portion and this portion here is actually 35% larger and humans than it is in macaque monkeys. So there must be something special about it mechanic monkeys, actually only have this posterior and mid portion of it and it's actually that whole post your name in portion is just extended throughout the entire length of insulin attack monkeys. There's also something really interesting about this anterior portion. It's more important for he donnick conditions like motivational social cognitive feelings of other an yourself and how you relate to the world. This sort of more emotional types of states. That parts here, OK, there's also the special neurons here called von Economo. Neurons are very special types of neurons. It's possible that autistic children or adults semen may not even have that type of neuron there, then that may be part of the reason that they don't have those type of connections with others and oneself. So this is a really special part of the brain anterior insula, which may be very important for meditation in developing an understanding of oneself. And so you may need this and it actually grows in size after only 8 weeks of mentation. How much how much can it go do have permanently growth will it grow and then go back down if you start now we don't know that's a good question so let's see what else we got here, we got focus right here, which is stages of insight, so as you meditate you can go through different various stages and these are sort of described by various People. This is described instead of sitting manga path to liberation traditional Buddhist texts. Other People have described it, who are just more modern sort of boost. Geeks I guess you can call him, like Daniel Ingram or something like that. On this sort of describe the stages of thought as a thought. Cause and effect impermanence suffering in those self realizing that those types of things. This won't stage arising and passing away would be another sort of stage of realization, or just understanding and each hour and permanence. I'm in a sort of relates back to what this was because remember I told you that you see arising and passing an object space. But this is just sort of a one time thing you may see the arising and passing an object over and over and over again till you realize only got everything is arising and passing including myself and that's sort of what this stage is really referring to. Dinner so you move the dissolution where everything sort of just dissolves and that can be kind of scary because so you go through these stages, which some People refer to as The Dark Knight would just terror misery and discussed and then once you get past that which some People get through really quickly. Some People take along time in any case, then you can move into some aspect every observation where you read observe what's going on inside your head and you gain equanimity? Which is a powerful sort of way of experiencing the world's sort of like you. A sturdy mast in a storm does on a sailboat and then you measure stream entry and this may be a little bit overrated, but make sure sure if this is a goal for everybody, but it's a state that People describe is sort of. You know a selfless state. Where it's a complete paradigm shift and once you're there, it's not likely that you're going to come out of the string, but it's one of the one of the stages of developing inside. However, there's going to be arguments about this. Let's see. So where we are now so we can go up here. There's a few brain areas painting. Let's see we can talk about going to make the Labs is really one of the areas that were really interested in how it connects to all these different areas in the frontal lobe. These are the mid. Medial frontal areas is in those numbers there like the numbers all correspond to different sort of subsystems sub areas of the brain that have been distinguished by the orientation of really just cells, but have also functional differences. Like Area 25 B 825 is what they call subgenual singulate. It's interesting because you can stimulate this area and People who are have intractable forms of depression People who just can't be. Cured by drugs psychotherapy. ECT you name it. They just can't be cured. They have depression and they're just in the Blues there. They have a lot of problem problems, but they found is actually if you stimulate this area. With deep brain stimulation so electrodes deep into the brain goes suddenly like wake up and they're happy so it's really interesting to think that you know, there can be those sort of substrates in the brain where you can stimulate and suddenly People were happy weren't so that's one of the reasons why we do this work is that we can understand like? What areas of the brain are involved with different types of psychopathology and emotion. And then we can sort of better use these ideas sort of diagnostic tools and then for better targeted therapy. Then you have DL Pfc which is the Dorsal Lateral Prefrontal Cortex, which is important for working memory and sort of goal directed thinking and sort of concentrations and then this whole area can be considered for the orbital frontal cortex that's OFC and then the ACC which is the answer singlet cortex, which is also one of the most important areas of the brain because you see that area light up for practically everything but the Dorsal Singular. Is probably one of the parts that are really important for meditation? We seem that it grows also in size like the insula, but has a different functional mechanism. It's more for monitoring so like awareness. Meta ONS Dorsal interesting that seems to be really important for that. So we can stay somewhere, Let's see we can move over to here. And we see mindfulness versus CBD so this is sort of just a study that we were thinking of looking at wealth cognitive behavioral therapies happens to be one of the most effective sort of treatments for depression and anxiety and different other forms of psychopathology well. How does it hold up? In a horse race against mindfulness if we even know what my Phone says you can think of it as an 8 week program of learning how to Meditate and doing some hatha yoga. So the question I guess here is can hold up and reduce some of the aspects of psychopathology. The symptoms that are related to psychopathology that CBT was intended to target and so CBT was developed by Canyon Aaron Beck and he created this triad of things that are going on in people's world view on his rumination and sort of negative sort of aspects of processing things over and over again and one's head, so very sort of negative self focus, so thinking about oneself in a negative framework was his 1st sort of aspects of his triad. And the other one was a negative world view towards present, and the future and sore actually all of this together, it creates this triad. So if you're thinking about yourself as negative. The world is negative in the past everything sucked. And in the future. Everything is going to suck that's basically what's happening when you have depression in sort of the back sort of model. You may agree or disagree with some of the things they say, but this is just a slice of my thinking on the board. That's like it really getting here and so some of the things that you see in these types of People across most psychopathologies emotional reactivity. People who react to emotional stress are in a way that's maladaptive that's for separate if it stays on all day. You can't let it go either. You can avoid things that's also bad emotion. Regulation strategies just either perceptually avoid things you don't even look at the things that sort of. Bother you or you just choose not to deal with it when you see it. Suppress emotion sort of it supplanted response also not to view so CBT one year relapse rate is about 25%. So that's interesting so People who get therapy. That sort of focuses on these aspects of the world. In one year. They will actually only 25% of People will actually relapse back into depression or some form of cycle pathology and that depressant use is 50%. So clearly drugs are not as effective at least in that sort of context as CBT. Turns out that mindfulness with some CBT is also as effective in preventing relapse for People who have experience at least 3 up, so the depression so that sort of fits into that equation as well. And so we're interested in sort of things like bias or emanation, emotional reactivity and avoid instant? How do we target these things and sort of measure them? That turns into stickies has more to the story here and so depression. I guess here is augmentation well. Do we augment traditional forms of approaches like CBT and anti depressants with mindfulness. As of augmentation strategy. So we're not just saying no drugs, but we're saying OK will give you some drugs, but we want to augment that strategy with something like mindfulness and that may be more helpful. And you see some more little I think we're moving along here we get them yellow stickies here, so some of the concepts that I've been thinking about it. I guess for fair mindful. This mind clearly is one of 'em dullness level of Dulles is something we need to understand effort that moves from positive to little meaning no effort mental defilements thing that sort of cloud your mind. And it Produce problems thinking negative thoughts. Distraction is also part of this is actually parts of the came out of the Thangka painting of the path stages of insight sort of just sort of took the pieces out and put on little stickies and so they're all parts of the path that insight. That sort of a rise and you have to deal with them and meta awareness line from the sister says what's the outcome to really call mind stabilized mind and insight into one's mind and this sort of this little Lupe is sort of my. Way of describing that URS an as you go through this path. You sort of loop around in the spiral and you come out with S Prime something a little different. And in the back here you see a Chinese Kenji character sort of what may be mindfulness can be described as candy character for presents and we can do character for heart. Together they create mindfulness presents heart may be a good way to think about it and then you know little cheat. Bhavana, a development of mind. Spiritual cultivation, something else seems more sort of little I guess aspect of what we think about. What else? So now we can talk about craving. We talk about craving for example, for cigarettes or even craving for you know from the Buddhist point of view is sort of an abstract concept. It's not so simple as just one area the brain and so, if you look at all. The literature out there and where creating is located in the brain whether it's for cigarettes and in terms of addiction or or craving in terms of even a loved one that you lose so for Los there's different parts of the brain that are involved. So many parts of the brain that it's going to be really hard to try to Localize. If you look here. This is the right hemisphere. These are all the areas of the brain by little hash marks that from all the research that we looked at have aspects of involvement in craving so this is just the right side and left side is down here. So there's a lot of things going on in terms of the brain brain activity for craving. So it's not so simple if we go here, you can see some of the things we've listed here. Oh, this actually makes him look at this enough while because this craving. Termination self regulation emotion regulation attention. These are actually some aspects of how we think. Aeros I guess are working that mindfulness may be working. Maybe reducing creating reducing rumination, reducing well, reducing avoidance and reactivity, increasing efficiency of attention improving pro social and ethical development and maybe working unconscious levels. Heavy and learning so you know sort of associative conditioning facilitating extinction re consolidation, decreasing resource allocation, so improving the efficiency of your whole brain. And then let's see what else OK. There's two more things on this board. If you can imagine. I think we've talked enough, but That's great we got schizophrenia. Oh kind of **** Tiffany schizophrenia is right up here so it turns out that. We have multiple paradigms that we test schizophrenics on and one of them is an emotional memory tasks. We give schizophrenics bunch of bunch of words that could be thought provoking or disturbing Tuas Clinic. And. The show increases in all these brain areas in the parapet. Campbell areas and they make the law in the insula medial prefrontal and Dorsal Lateral Prefrontal Cortex and So what does it all mean? Well, you create a story out of it? I'm not going to go into the whole story but essentially you have all these areas that sort of come online related to emotional memory, which makes sense and compare it. We always compare these brain areas activation to a normal subject so. Increases in The insular activity, maybe some sort of emotional sort of reactivity. An evaluative. Type of thing going on as well. Decreased PCC which may represent some sort of decreased representation of self are autobiographical nature of oneself. So we don't know exactly how tall pieces together you have to read the paper to get the sense sense of really how it all fits together or else you just see a bunch of arrows. But then there's another paradigm read the paper what paper paper will probably come out schizophrenia and. We did a CBT intervention with them, actually and so it turns out schizophrenics can respond to CBT number CD. Yeah, thank you. 80. That means anticipated threat. We looked at how schizophrenic sort of anticipate threat. And so it turns out that they have these really interesting increases in activity in Visual Association areas or does that mean it could be that there really processing threat at a very sort of sort of primary level of sensory processing much more activity going on there than normal individual would and that could also facilitate how one processes threat if there's increased. Sensory processing and that could also lead to increased interpretation of threat. And the Mecula and hippocampus go up to. That means that there is also increases in sort of autonomic reactivity to the threat. And then when they're in safety when they know that they can be safe and that there is no threat. There's still increased processing and this sort of the visceral sort of activities going on, some precuneus activity as well. So what does that mean I mean, we don't not sure for sure, but there's definitely some extra processing going on? That's probably unnecessary trying to interpret what's happening. OK so there's one last thing here that we can really sort of focus on I guess for this board. Um. I think it's probably this little board thing here. This is the. The default mode network, we hate the default mode network because it's confusing who hate it. I hate it because it represents. What happens to your mind when it's wondering and stimulus independent thought So what you do when you're thinking when you're not really doing anything else cold directed. It's very passive. But when it's passive. It's actually doing a lot of things itself, reflecting about the past or the future. And Randy Buckner's group is sort of. Parse depart the sort of used very highly advanced statistical modeling techniques to say that there's actually 2 subsystems within the default mode network, one could be a DM Pfc network to the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex network. And that involves the TPJ temporal junction also very interesting area, even if you're bored already. This is an area that stimulated you would have an antibody experience. It's very dissociative area. So TJ is actually quite interesting and the lateral temporal cortex in the temporal pole. That's one network and the other one would be the medial temporal lobe network, which involves ventromedial prefrontal cortex and what's so cool about this value driven nature sense that whenever you evaluate anything. Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex comes at night. But it also involves post here in Europe right lobe hippocampal formation, so areas that are more related to memory then autobiographical memory. And it turns out that that subsystem is more important for may be thinking about oneself in the future or as this network is more important for thinking about oneself in the present weather. It's oneself or other can you see these different networks when you look at the brain? Yeah, exactly so we do it separately so that's we're hoping to sort of disambiguate them from what People are doing when they're doing nothing. It's not sort of a default mode. Everyone has different things that they think about when they're not thinking about anything. And meditators happen to have a problem thinking about or wandering really far so that they're going to look very different from a lot of People, especially the People ruminate but they look very different. There's also this little area here, which actually is 2. Nodes of the default mode network that are shared between these 2 subsystems as the anterior medial prefrontal cortex and the posterior seems like cortex. They just happened to be the connections for the whole default mode network. OK, well. Thank you for coming. Thank you very much that was great and sort of pause here.","title":"DAVE VAGO shares his (MIND) BOARD"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/density-that-is-unifying-and-liberating/","text":"So we're talking about OK, I said, I actually contrast in spacious versus dance. So for me, dense is just means not spacious. OK, now here's where it gets where you have to be really careful about words and this is exactly the point you brought up. Which I was wondering if anyone would bring up actually so good for you? Um. When you get into very highly concentrated states. You can get a sense that things are thickening or getting quote dense. But it's pleasant. And it's unifying at all, so liberating. That's contracted flow. That's another flavor of contracted flow that Featherlight paper see expansion and contraction are. Technical terms all what about technical terms, OK, they have very specific meanings expansion and contraction. In my system. Comfort a huge range of sub flavors. The lightness thin this can be parsed as contracted that jonak. Sort of quote density could also be parsed as contractive and they're both Pleasanton liberating just in different ways, so that's what I have to say about that. Well, one obvious difference is. That the Quote bad debt. Hurts like hell? Whereas the good density really feels good. Uh. That's an obvious difference. The reason for that difference if I were to put it in words is that they quote bad density. Is comes about? From resisting the contracted force. Where is the quote good density comes about through deeply surrendering to the contract of course is not that subtle cellular? Rigidity against contraction. And the good density. Is actually? Halfway to global gone. OK. And global gone is a big deal, global gone is the 9th JAMA. That's sit there for a week and your breasts tops. Except having different obviously doesn't completely stop, but you know that's sort of Waxy Catatonic Physiological trance. That's good if you're fortunate enough to be moving in that direction, so that's what I have to say about that.","title":"Density that is Unifying and Liberating"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/description-of-paths-to-liberated-experience-enlightenment/","text":"There are. Many ways. 2. Come to optimal happiness. Um. You can. Carefully observed phenomena. Break them down into finer and finer distinctions until you see the vibrant void. That is their nature. That's sort of the observing and we use that a lot here. There is a another strategy that can be successful. Um. Which is more than nurture positive kind of thing? If you go all the way. And develop a? Absorption level of concentration on positive image talk and emotional body. You literally become that and your former identity passes away. Or at least is suspended for awhile so I reckon that at least in theory. Nurture positive could be a path. 2 radical freedom and in fact. It is this is one of the major claims of a driana practice in Tibet that the so-called deity yoga practices. They're not just concentration exercises. They are a Component by component replacement of the inner see here of the ordinary human see, hear feel with alternate archetypal identity. The reason to do it is not to go insane to think that you're a myth. The reason to do it is not. It's not show monic possession. It's a very different critter. It's done systematically in order to gain insight into the arbitrary nature of self identification. Um. So part of my. Of the influences on me in. Developing the way of teaching that I teach well. I'm very influenced by early Buddhism that took the divide and conquer strategy. Um. Which is OK, you break it down into pieces of pieces and eventually you sort of know it to death and love it to death. An you become free the IT in this case is self. Uhm OK, so that's what sort of leads to the focus in approach that I use. Um. However, the nurture positive working explicitly with image talk, emotional body am in Vajrayana. You also work with the physical body by making Moodar's. Um. Working with those components if you develop enough concentration. That's why they call Aditi yoga, yoga has many meanings. One of the meanings is exercise another meaning of yoga is merging. Or becoming So you merge with. You actually become the archetypal content that you create and as I say it's not to go insane. And it's not too. Shaaban eccle channel something it's to gain insight into the arbitrary nature of self identification. If it's like playing with with with identity like with Lego toys. It's like a Tinker toy kit. You put one identity together they take it apart. Now then you put another one together. Then you take it apart is it's not just one deity yoga, it's like a sequence of deities. An I take that as a pathic could in theory, give you insight into no self so that's a whole way of working. Then there's sort of. Zen, which has a lot of different aspects to it, which I won't go into but one just one of the aspects in Zen is. A merging of inside and outside by pouring all your attention on the physical sight, physical sound physicality of the body. There's only so much real estate in consciousness, so if all the water sloshes out that inner world. Contracts and vanish is. And you merge you become one with. What was formerly out? So that's a way of working then there's a whole other approach, which might be called. The meditation of no meditation. Where you simply drop all effort 8? That contrasts. With the other ways of working right you can. Take the components of self and untangle them and see their vibrant. Void nature or you can merge with an archetype the ordinary identity contracts a mythic identity expands. Once again, you get insight into the arbitrary nature of self identification or you can merge out see out here out feel out. Um. But those all require effort. Particularly the deity yoga, type practice you're having to actually create intentionally the image that talk, the body sensations and so forth. So very contrasting with that is OK drop, all effort so that's a do nothing kind of approach that works for some People well. Um. Are contrasting approach to all of the above? Which. I don't normally do as part of the system. But it's definitely something that is powerful and something to look into if you're interested is this whole sort of self inquiry way of working. Uh. It's been discovered an rediscovered in different forms. Different cultures different times. Um. It tends to be associated with some of the Hindu Advaita teachings. And so forth. There's some great great advisor teachers online that have really deep experience using this approach. Um. So. In Sanskrit, it's called Optima V Chara, which are a means to investigate. Ah, not money itself, but it also is another part of some of the Zen teachers who am I what are you? In fact that was the koan. That. My very first teacher gave me a Camera Kacian said say that was the last time when he and I were together in Japan. I was going back to the US and he said, OK, here's your koan. Who are you? What are you? And. It's like OK? How do I work on this koan? Turn the light back on itself. What do you mean? Swim back to the source of the stream of consciousness what's that mean? Just do it. So that was sort of I'm paraphrasing but that was sort of the dialogue OK. There's not much you can. It's not an algorithm OK. It's like groping you're pushing back pushing back pushing back. A question. Cola, who am I or where does that come from or who sees you can choose any language that you want. There's a lot of ways to formulate the question the important thing to realize is. This is Co-op work this is this is not an intellectual question that you're going to say. Oh, I am and there's going to be a substantive an now you have answered that question that's not what this is about this is. About. Each arising of self you're trying to sort of metaphorically look over your shoulder and see where it came from. Um. As I say it could be formulated in a lot of different words, but the method is the same. Essentia Lee, the same work very similar. Uh. For some People that ends up very much related to that, spacious thing, that we were doing where you start to get a sense that OK. I'm the space all around looking in that might be a stage that you pass through and you dis identify with the content of experience. Um. A good teacher of this method won't won't let you mistake. A fixated sense of witness as the true self, though. If it if it's at all fixated in space like OK. I'm over here kind of thing. Well, now, you need to look back a little further. Um. So interesting Lee It's not just in Hinduism and some of them. Buddhist schools. Of Zen, but you actually find this method or something a little like this used in some of the terrified of traditions where they're trying to sort of like inquire push it back push it back. I've seen some TB of teachers that teach this way. And really interesting. Is? Some anonymous guy. In the 15th century in England. Hippopotamus. Um. An I would almost be certain that he hit upon it without anyone pointing it out to him. He just hit upon it just discovered it. Um. Do you know who I'm talking about? Is Anonymous, but there's a work of literature, he wrote that's the cloud of Unknowing. A classic in both Catholicism and Anglicanism. Um. A Piscop Arian In other words, in there, you can see him struggling to try to describe something. That had no tradition in Europe. And. But you could see it was really important for him, I should have prepared to show you the. Section but I'm paraphrasing but it's something like. Um. Keep. Keep beating away at the cloud of ignorance. With the sword of. Love of God. Pushing back pushing back. To understand to experience. Your existence? What lies Behind you moment by moment I'm paraphrasing maybe I'll go find the quote on the Internet. But it's something to that effect. It's very obvious that he's struggling to describe something like a self inquiry process. Seems obvious to me anyway and I find it extraordinary that. Someone would have hit upon this. I independently and within the context of. Or that was pre reformation, so within the context of Catholicism basically that's a whole other way of working. And different the the approaches are it's nice because the approaches contrast, so each person can find one or a combination of these that they can relate to. So there's a wide range of. Ways that you can go back out and personally. You know, some People are sort of Mono Spiritual. There they do best with just one approach, but I find that a lot of People are BI or Multi. I certainly AM. All those approaches to me seem like one approach. Um. I would say that the closest thing with in what I do. To the self inquiry way of working. Is? Just not gone. Can you see Why? Can you see the parallelism? What's what's the question that self inquiry? Asked where does it come from? What's the question that just not gone answers? And answers the question where does it go to? 'Cause you're you're developing an appreciation for where things go to when they disappear. Now I know initially. So gone is defined. Very very carefully with in my system. All or part of something abruptly subsides and you notice it. That's the definition of gone and you might wonder. Want to set up such a weird definition, whi language, it that way. Well. Uh. Where something goes to when it disappears? Is the same place it comes from when it where a goes to win it vanish? Is is where becomes from? In the next instant. When it manifests. So. An inquiry method you're sort of OK a has arisen where did it come from. You're trying to set up look back. To the source of the stream. Turn the light back on itself turn consciousness back on itself or a very common paradigm be conscious of consciousness. Um. So the gone is a just disappeared. And if you If you briefly look in that direction. You're going to see that that's where B is going to pop out of. On. And what is it? Well. It's emptiness. That's what that's the tranquil side. Of the process. So that's one side of emptiness. Um. And then the dynamic side of the process. Is how emptiness breaks apart? It happens to everyone hundreds of thousands of times a day. Um. We just it's so subtle. We just don't notice it by large. But. The nothing which. Is not extended in time and space? It breaks apart. And that happens with a kind of bouncy's spontaneity. OK. Just happens. Um. And. There's a sense of space effortlessly spreading. And at the same time, there's a sense of space effortlessly collapsing. In terms of traditional Tera Vaada Formulations. They talk about Diaby A or rising passing. At some point you're. Awareness is dominated by this cyclic sense of there's just rising and passing and your real detached from the content. It's just risings passings risings passing some of its pleasant. Some of its unpleasant. Some of it makes sense. Some of it doesn't make sense, but you're you have a sense that you're in contact with some primordial ordering principle that is a pre human order. The Order of nature. Human order is my body is comfortable and my minds got answers. This Prehuman Order is. What proceeds Free Energie Entropy Maybe. That's my guess. Um. That's what causes things to protect your summer polity to fall up into existence. So. There is a stage comes. And typically. You pass through this stage. 10,000 times in a lifetime, but it just becomes clearer and clearer and clearer with each new challenge level. You sort of have to go through the same thing again. That's one way to look at progress is a lot of different ways to map progress, but one is OK. Can you be in on a rising passing situation with this level of pain in your leg OK? Well, how about the next level of pain in your leg. Well, how about taking your heart. Well, how about how about how about how about how about an when you reach the point where it doesn't matter how big or complex or what the content is but you can instantly. Be in on a rising passing situation. Um then you're doing pretty good. However. After the arising passing thing. Or on a continuum innocence with that. Is a sense of passing as its arising? No sooner is it arising but it's already passing this is described in the classic Ovie city mug off the path of purification written by put the Cosa so also described by the Anglican poet. TS Eliot in my beginning is my end. That's how one of his lines open in my beginning is my end. It's like already dying as soon as it's born. That is that taking a temporal slice. As soon as it's arising it's already passing. But spatially that means as soon as it's spreading it's already collapsing. Because remember sensory events occupy timespace volumes. They last for a period of time and they have with depth and height. Check it out, we did it in the group process does your sear feel not have with depth and height. It does so as soon as spreading in terms of with depth and height. It's already collapsing along all three of those dimensions. So that's sort of the. The extreme version of arising passing is like passing as its arising. Spreading effortlessly as its collapsing effortlessly. Um. And in the folds of that vibrant dense of space. Are born? Um. The inner and outer see, hear feel. That create the surrounding seen experience. And the I have a self looking out at the surrounding seen experience. They. There's a metaphor from the vigiano vow to school. Based on a snail OK. Uh. The snails eyes. They belong to the same snail OK. But. They come out on these 2 different stocks. And then they can actually face each other consciousness. Comes from one formless source. Anne its visual auditory somatic, but half of it seems out and the other half seems in but it's really just consciousness looking at consciousness. So. Ah. Those sensory experience. Arise in the vibrating folds in between this effortless spread and collapse of space. So that sense of. Space effortlessly spreading and collapsing. That's the dynamic side of emptiness. And then at some point. That. That process sort of comes to an end. Expansion and contraction cancel out. And it's a flat line, but that's not the right metaphor. It's it all collapses back down to. The next gone. Um. So. Sometimes People like to talk about non dual I mentioned that term few minutes ago advaita non too. So non dual. Is another way to say 1? Or it's another way to. To say healing. A a wound healing. An alienation healing a cleft. That separates So there's a lot of. Healings that have to take place. One is the seeming separation of inside and outside. If you were listening carefully to what I said, You should have an idea of how. That that duality could be transcended. And to transcend the duality of inside and outside that's no small thing. What are some of the ways? Well, I actually mentioned a few of them. One is You can allow out to expand. While in contracts In other words, the see out here out feel out of the surrounding seen you pour all your attention on that. So much so that the CN here, and feeling of the reactive self. Contracts to nothing. And then your identity just goes out and inhabits what was formerly other that's one way to go about it. On another way to go about it is. The outer seen arises and there's a reactive self. It also arises. However, there's so much habitual concentration clarity and equanimity in those circuits. That both the outer scene and the. In herself. Arise as a waveform. And. So the 2:00 waves completely interpenetrate. And there is a Oneness of inside and outside as a kind of unified dance of Energi. That's another way that you can have a? You can breakdown the duality between inside and out. One of the major paradigms. Of Enlightenment, In World Mysticism is. The Oneness. Um. In Dallas terms, it tends to be Oneness of inside and outside in theist. IDK religions, it tends to be Oneness of the soul with God. Um. How old do you experience oneness of the soul with God? Well. How 'bout experiencing yourself arising in between the 2 sides of God moment by moment that would do the trick? Especially if it's your screwed up self. That would be really good. Up. To experience you're screwed up self being loved into existence. By the dance of space moment by moment. It's pretty good might help you. Be a little more loving of your screwed himself. The 2:00 Achieve a sense of Oneness of inside and outside. Is admirable? But I would say that. It's not the deepest experience of nondual. The deepest experience of non dual. Comes about When the Duality or separation. Between the One nothing. And the 10 trillion something. When that Separation. Is healed? That's real nanteuil awareness. Um. What in the world is he talking about? So. The one nothing that is the source that's what gone points, too. That's also what you see when you're successful in self inquiry. I need. See where you come from? You see where you got. That's the one nothing. Um. Then there's the 10 trillion somethings of self and world. Another way to put it is. Emptiness and form so the heart. Sutra says she group Rupam should Natasha in your type of Rupa form is emptiness emptiness is form. Now it's very interesting, they put it both ways. Form is emptiness emptiness is form. That is the entire path. Viewed from one point of view. It's only one point of view, but that's the entire path right there. The first half of the path is form is emptiness. That's dissolution that's Loving and knowing form to death. Um within the Jewish meditation tradition, it's called Betul Hi Ash. The annihilation of the something. Don't be afraid of it. Don't be afraid to just sit there. An totaly let go of the ordinary ordering principle. The ordinary human ordering principle, which I reiterate? What did I say the human ordering principle is body is comfortable and Ynez answers. Now I'm not. Saying that there's anything wrong with the normal human ordering principle in fact, we're humans. Mostly that's what we need but. We also need a larger context. A pre human ordering. The source of the human ordering presumably. Um. So. Don't be afraid to just. Let it all collapse into what seems to be chaos. Because what's interesting is what? What seems to be random? Is in fact what? What causes order to arise? Entropy. Um. So you sort of surrender to that. Um. And. You let this something this just be torn apart. And you throw caution to the wind. And for a period of time abandoned. Totale. The ordinary ordering principle. Doesn't matter if the bodies comfortable or not doesn't matter if my mind is confused or not? Annihilation of the something nahs. And what will happen is it will all become rising passing right arising passing and then it would just be passing passing and. Um. Then. You will. Began to see how that nothing. Molds each moment. Um. And each moment is one of the 10 trillion somethings. That I'm alluding to the 10 trillion somethings of self and world. This is happening here, I'm experiencing this here. My mind is doing. This my body is doing this, they're doing that were over here. It's 10 trillion somethings. That constitute a life. Um. How can we connect? Have an unbroken on dual. Link. Between the one nothing over here. And the 10 trillion somethings. Well, this is about the deepest principle that I am personally aware of in practice. Um. What the umbilical cord the thing that allows for a smooth and continuous transform? From the one nothing to one of the 10 tree and some things back to the one nothing. What connects is the 2 doings? The two doings are the 2 sides of emptiness. Space. Effortlessly spreading and collapsing. They are the 2 sides of 0. And in the falls. Is? Arise is one of the 10 trillion somethings. And whatever it is I thought a body sensation a site a sound. Whatever it is. It's always embraced from, without and within. By the 2 doing. So it. The ordinary experience. Is touched? By the 2:00 doings, but the 2:00 doings are in fact. The 2 sides of the one nothing. And that allows you to have an experience. Thousands and thousands of times a day. Of. This. Merin culas. Arising of something from nothing. Form is emptiness. That's The Path. Of the solution. Emptiness is form. If you are heroic enough to do that. You get to live the rest of your life. Seeing. Each. He. Sensory event as this kind of miracle. That arises. Sitting on the totality of the of the universe. Seems like you're participating in that process. And in the Hebrew that's called? Briard year, Schmidt iron. The continuing continuous creation of Yesh things met from iron the divine nothingness. That's A spontaneous fancy process. And. Because of that. You. Lookup on each thing as sort of. Sharing your womb. And. In the Jewish tradition. At least the Jewish Mystical tradition. It is said that. Through that participation. Comes about something called T Kuhn, orlaam them, ending of the world.","title":"Description of & Paths to Liberated Experience (Enlightenment)"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/developing-the-taste-of-purification/","text":"We talk a lot about purification. On this path and especially I hear you talk about it is one of the. Benefits or events that happen with this practice, but I'll speak to my own experience, but purification isn't always pretty and sometimes you have be blindsided with lots of. Emotion or disconcerting internal Top or you know could you just speak to this process of working with purification and or how it can arise? What are the different forms of purification that we could experience and in terms of working with that as its own phenomenon? Sometimes People confuse the purification might think that's a new problem. When one practices. As time goes on one develops kind of sensitivity. To something that I call purification. In fact, I would say that one of the major watersheds in a person's practice. Is when they start to develop the taste of purification or they can actually sense that purification is happen So what do we mean by purification? It's a perception that. Because of the way that I'm experiencing this moment. With high concentration sensory clarity an especially equanimity. Because of the way I'm experiencing this moment. Things that have been getting in the way from the past. Are getting worked through? And you actually sense that that is happening. Now, how do you sense that that's hard to put into words? You just develop it's like wine tasting wine tasters can detect all sorts of subtleties in flavor bouquet finish you know tannens what have you. They just develop the pallet to detect stuff that the average person doesn't detect. At some point every meditator who stays with the process. Develops this sense that because of how I'm experiencing the present the past, is being worked through. Like I say I can't put into words how you know it's happening. But you just do you also know that because of that every moment in the future is going to be better for you? So that's a huge watershed in practice because before that happens. Your preoccupation with regards to meditation is to have certain experiences while you meditate you want to be concentrated. You want to be calm. You want to have altered states you want to have whatever you want to have feel good have something interesting and entertaining or unusual happen. When People start their practice. That's how they evaluate their practices like you know something good or interesting or unusual happened so that was a good meditation at some point if you stay with it, you develop this sensitivity for the purification. And then Your motivation shift you're not interested in getting to any particular state you're interested in setting the stage for nature to optimize purification. You said to set the stage and let time pass and the purification is taking place, and you can taste it. And because you can taste it, you don't mind if you're in a lot of pain in your body you don't mind if there's a lot of emotions in your body you don't mind if there's a lot of confusion in your mind because, although under by ordinary ways of thinking painted the body uncomfortable emotions at the body confusion in the mind. That's like the last thing in the world. Anybody would ever want. But if you can taste the purification while that's going on. So you know the past, is getting worked through and the future every moment of the future will be better for me because of how I'm experiencing this present moment uncomfortable, though it is, once that taste of purification kicks in. Then you start to grow exponentially the rate of growth. Takes off in a hockey stick mode. When you kiss those way you think taste of purification. That's making it sound like on developing a taste. You know when someone is drinking wine. They know they're drinking wine, but no, the interpretation of if that is purification. If it isn't purification and or my relationship to that is that you said. Oh, I don't mind if I'm in pain. I don't mind do you say develop a taste you mean where that starts to become a pleasant experience? I would say that whenever a person in the present moment. Brings a quality of concentration clarity and equanimity to their experience or even one or two of those. At any level whatsoever. Purification is happening whether they're aware of it or not. Whether they are aware of it or not, it is happened. But after long practice you know it's happening. But I cannot describe to you how you know it's another dimension of experience you sense it. You knowing help the process. The knowing is what makes the process snowball. That's what gives the exponential growth because the fact. In other words, you're getting a reward. I wouldn't exactly, say the reward is pleasure. It's another kind of reward, although you will typically react with pleasure when you taste purification. The taste itself is not the taste of pleasure. It's its own dimension. It's just one of those things you have to experience by practicing but once that happens, then no matter how horrific and experience maybe. You're getting rewarded in that experience, not necessarily rewarded by pleasure, but rewarded by this something else. This taste of purification so that more you taste it. The more you're willing to have equanimity the more you're willing to have equanimity the more you tasted that's called a positive feedback loop and your practice just goes off on a hockey stick curve before that, it tends to be linear and rather. Subtle once the taste of purification develops you got this positive feedback loop and it just goes and that's that's how you make that journey of 1,000,000 miles in just a few years, you only walked 110 miles in the first year but what you don't realize is the longer you walk the faster you walk and the taste of verification is the main thing that makes that happen.","title":"Developing the 'Taste of Purification'"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/digging-holes/","text":"We can say you know what my path to enlightenment. Is going to be see it? That's it theoretically you could do that. Assuming you have had enough image activity to warrant that. And then it's all about the see him. It's about having a complete experience of CN. So complete that it bores a hole through the time space Continuum and. The whole. The whole field just gets sucked into that nirvanic black hole through CN alone. Could you do that in theory? Yes. Could you do that with any of these atoms in theory yes? Could you do that with any of the modalities or any of the themes. Yeah, you could. Because remember appreciation, which is just my poetic way of saying Experience Mindfully. Uh. Appreciation. And experience mindfully is experience with concentration clarity and equanimity. So quick way of saying all of that appreciation taken to its limit the under certain threshold. Of skill. Appreciation becomes transcendence. At points to the formless. So that is just say that, although we have the possibility of working at using this sort of microscope with three magnification pieces, Adams systems. Everything that is not to say you have to do that. It's just to say that a person could do that. Now you probably heard the expression Oh well, you should you shouldn't dig a hole lot of holes you should just take one deep Oh. Well. Um. For some People that's probably true. You should just. Have one thing and just stick with that, but not inevitably and I would rather use a different metaphor. Then the lot of shallow holes, which is pejorative. I would say you can learn a couple of ways, one ways, yeah, OK did all the way down. From the form to the formless. 1 hole. But you're still going to have to deal with all the rest of this stuff. It gets dealt with by getting sucked down that hole, but there's still that process. Technique was you never do anything but this but still all this stuff has to be dealt with. Through that technique. Who is Nirvana means? That the hope you you literally fold up the board the games over for awhile anyway. You fold up the board and goes into the closet. Oh don't worry, it will come out again. Uh. So instead of the Pejorative Ova, Oh, you're digging a lot of shallow holes. Let's use a different metaphor. You've got a backhoe and you're just clearing the whole field to a certain level and then you clear the whole field to another level until when you finally get to. Bottom.

Let's just have an example of one of these exercises. One of them one of them once we use, something physical not the thought once Alright Alright. So here's yeah, so one. Simple way of getting this feeling of of shifting your awareness Outof. The identification with your mind, which creates this little self looping identity is to have awareness just. Again, I'm talking to you. The awareness of talking to you. The awareness and the awake awareness. So if you think? How am I going to unhook awareness for thought I've never done that. I don't know if I can do that. And that is correct. You cannot do it, but awareness can do it. So you just have to be sometimes. I call it. The Colombo approach. It's like so by the way before I leave. I just unhook awareness and have it drop. By the way this side this side. Just you know just without thinking that and then you'll be awake, so see you next so just simply have awareness, which is identified attached thought simply unhook and step back and then see what it feels like if awareness, which is the center of knowing drops and knows your Smile from within your smile. Does your jaw from within your jaw? Without looking up to thought and without stretching or looking down from thought. Have awareness that knows directly drop into your throat. Now your throat from within. And then I feel awareness drop below your neck. And feel your upper torso or come into your heart space. And you can smile and breathe. And just feel what it's like to directly perceive. Your body from within without orienting. To thought and without going to sleep. Feel the central wrecked. Awareness based embodied. Open hearted non. Thought based knowing. Which is kind of alert? So we have space to wear a lightness. And it's aware of awareness. Which is aware by itself? Just feel that relief. And notice this new non conceptual. Embodied. Way out. Shifting into another dimension. Of your consciousness. See what's absent. It was there and then see the qualities of presents. Let's start to cut up. Shimmer. What do you notice? Um would love in what one thing I love about that is not checking up you see looking up, you're not looking. I'm not looking up an I'm not looking down here going outlook. That's happening there. I'm not. This witness watching this which is in your neck structure. Do alot like I feel my knee and now I'm from labeling here, but you literally talk about. Being there and for me that's like. See here not much nice it's full is nice. It's warm. It's there's love along and the not looking up, looking down is free 'cause you realize it's kind of like The Wizard of Oz is behind there trying to move all the gears to make that thing work and it's like he's not there anymore, so you can just allow it to be something. Without all the well, you know stuff there and that's nice and then just take us out. Check this out. Interesting Lee is a bunch of different ways kind of like Utah. I'm like you. Aware of different learning types, so some People are kinesthetic. Some People are emotional. Some People are more mental some people with visual. Some People have auditory so I use different doors for some People will like Oh that one was really good and that one didn't work, so well, but by the time we do short little. Everyone thinks something so I'm starting to happen and they get to the same place and then interesting they use their own words. Even describe it and they don't need to use the vocabulary that I'm starting with that's the style of his teaching. Hill kind of guide you to an experience and then literally rather than talking about it has everyone go around the room and report their words and what's nice always about that is one is a student you get to hear? What everyone else is doing. Not that I'll have some of that he is. It helps open your idea to other things that can be or maybe it was worth you hadn't thought to describe it. Your own experience is the teacher sitting there, I was going where they go puffcorn happening in this room and throughout the workshop. You hear someone to be aware of where this, what you hear them at the beginning and at the end. There were a couple People at the end going. Oh, and you get these are has and you know as a teacher. I guess you know high fiving him and going out is so cool 'cause. That's teacher. The Moody tell you get this joy at that because you know they walked out the door with something that's kind of shift their life in a good way, and not giving them tools to be able to do it themselves, yeah, so there's like these short practices and I've written this book about it. Oh yeah, you * forgot there's a quick you wanna you wanna put something on this? What's your book shift in the freedom. The science and practice of Openhearted Awareness. Alright got that shift into freedom and then currently there's an audio and it's a very perfect title for what this is too. It is exactly a shift in defeat and there's an audience in the audio currently is the audio of the practice is not. The audio of the book you wanna sleep there for 12 hours. I end up doing it. That and that will come out, but I always like to hear the teacher like I want to hear Pema Chodron read her book. I want to hear the word. I don't want the actor. They hired that's where I want to hear you describe it. Could you also get that kind of the energy of how it comes in so when you say it's the audio just practice the audio of the practice is kind of the teaching style is? You know like the teacher. It's right. I'm introducing the students to their own inner teacher. You know, and when I'm. Showing or pointing them to look within its not. Look up here, but look back within you and then once you discover this non conceptual awareness by being able to speak from there. It's really not even about the words. It's about speaking from non conceptual heart mind so that you start to rewire functioning and living from this new way of knowing. And being so that you can start to make it a normal thing and then the middle of your life. You can start to just walk down the street go to work have relationships hang out, have fun. From a continuous awakening losing it and part of the small glimpses. Of course, initially you're going to recognize realize an lose it and then the practices re recognize so training to re recognize and return and remain an then speak and walk and talk. From there and then lose it and then no big surprise just re recognize and then again, and the training. Can be done with these small glimpses in the midst of your day?","title":"Direct Awakening Exercise ~ LOCH KELLY with Stephanie Nash"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/earthquake/","text":"Now that sounds like the wealth of the earth, meaning that it could could become.

Just just some entertainement up here in Palace birdies just for you all for tonight. Thank you they seem to happen. On Friday nights like this second one in about 2 months on Friday night just about this time. Oh no that's great we were enjoying it. Joe is having a complete experience. What can I say we can do a lot better than that? Yeah, we don't get them on these coast very much true. The The Earthquake. Yes, what to do when the earthquake comes well. But there's a semco on anyone care to answer what to do when the earthquake comes. Well, that's the explanation or the manifestation. My explanation would be you can't shake the shaking. Um impermanence. Complete experience. Actually does feel like an earthquake. That earthquake was on queue for me at least are going to interpret it that way. I was just about to say that when you have a complete if experience. It feels like an earthquake it shakes heaven and earth because it is the. The authentic person without a fixed position, I wasn't going to relate it to an earthquake OK just but it is a reasonable comparison, and one in fact that I have made numerous times in the past. So one of the. Times when I knew that this practice was really doing something industrial strength. For me was when we have the center. Some of you were around back that far on Elden Ave remember in Korea town. So 1 morning I. I had to go in to do something that I'd forgotten and so I had gotten in my car and then so I forgot to do that and I ran into the center. Um. And I left the keys in the car is downtown right. And sure enough like. 2 minutes later, I came out. The cars gone. And what was that experience. I'm remembering it because at the time. It was. Just like an earthquake. That's all there was no thought there was no emotion. As an object it was so complete that it was just. Space rocking. It was just like that last penultimate scene in the first matrix. When? Puts the name of the character, but yeah. Neo Neo. Neil realises who he is right, and the whole frame of the movie Sorta goes a wall. I mean that's really what it was like it wasn't just my my mind, and my body was the sight and sound. Everything the whole frame of the self in scene was just this wave. And then It was just like being massage. And then I just went in called the cops and left with that was that you know reported it. That was dramatic.

Lack of sensory clarity, so most of the time with practices separating. But there are those huge windows that opened. Where the practice is unified and that's the dialectic of this practice, it's about that's one of the balance aspects. The. It's a dynamic back. OK, there's a place there's a whole list of empowering distinctions. And there's a whole list of empowering unification. And there's a whole list of disempowering distinctions and there are even disempowering unifications totally get that. You got your moneys worth yeah? What's an example of a disempowered? What's what are some examples of disempowering unifications. Say what Coda Enmeshment. Uh. Week eagle structure where they got borderline issues. Uh and Last but not least identification with the aggressor Patty Hearst syndrome. So there's this whole list of Disempowering Unifications. But there's also the flip side of all of the above. Is empowering antifa? And then there's disempowering distinctions of which the main one is. My identity stops with my skin. That's the that's the biggest disempowering distinction. Distinction between inside and outside and then the distinction between material and spiritual between form and emptiness. Those are all disempowering. Distinctions so the name of the game is or the bad news is. That. Most human beings are involved in disempowering distinctions and disempowering unification. The good news is that any human being who chooses to can flip it. And with a lot of study and practice come too. Understand empowering distinctions an empowering unifications. So the focus in technique is interesting for example. I usually present it to you as a deconstructive technique, but it's actually also a restorative technique. People that have a? Are these? Sometimes it's called borderline or you know. Boundary problem in the sense that they can't remember who they are when they're in the presence of the looming other. OK, there's this. Diagnosis right and I've had People that had like official psychiatric diagnosis. All of that week ego structure thing and the description that they gave and the description from the diagnostic and statistical manual was in the prop presence of other People. The looming other, they just can't keep contact with who they are. Well guess Wat the focus in technique will allow you to do that. And that's what I used actually use this woman had had a lifelong big-time diagnosis. You know from a professional psychiatry. And what I did is I just had a poodle just a little different spin on the focus in. Instead of using it to untangle the IMF. I had to use it to keep in contact with the fact that she does have an internal life. Even in the presence of the looming other. And it's very tangible and the clarity allowed her to know she had mental image. Mental talk and emotional body sensations. Even when the looming other was present in the looming other was any other human. When it started and so that's the sensory clarity. What's the concentration piece is to not lose contact with that content. In the presence of the looming others just training. Just training. So. That's now using the focus in which in some ways could be thought of as breaking down the small self. But just put a little different spin on it, it's actually empowering the ability to not lose yourself. When you need to have a distinction between inside and outside so you've probably heard this expression. Call you have to have an ego before you could let go of the ego, etc, etc. Well I'm not sure that I would exactly formulate it that way. But I would say that there is a dialectical process. Ah and I drew a picture OK. So anyway. You you know who first came up with that expression about you have to have an ego before you can let go of it. That was Jack Angler, who is both a mindfulness teacher and A at one time was the head of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, which tells us something about the age and Country Living. Uh so I told Jack. This story about the woman with the. Whatever and he actually immediately invited me to do grand rounds at Harvard Medical School based on that whole. Paradigm. I ended up wasn't able to go, but you know historically interesting.","title":"EMPOWERING (or NOT) DISTINCTIONS & UNIFICATIONS"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/focus-on-rest-as-one-of-the-5-ways/","text":"id: focus-on-rest-as-one-of-the-5-ways title: 'Focus on Rest' as one of the '5 Ways' hide_title: false sidebar_label: 'Focus on Rest' as one of the '5 Ways' You're talking about your background in math and science your your your understanding of all the comparative religion, and your your how your background has come in the precision of language in using everything else to create these five ways that are pulling on all these this tradition. Can you give me an example of of? These five ways described this to me, I mean, these techniques are these. It is like 5 different techniques that you do that is correct, it's 5 different focus techniques. Each one of which represents a modern secular version of something that somebody innovated in the past within have to deal with the what you're focusing on that. You talked about earlier. That's correct is each one of these focusing on something else, Essentia Lee yes. Oh, OK can you just give me an example of? What these certainly you focusing on here? One of the strong influences is from early Buddhism. And in early Buddhism. They had practices that involved. Attaining states of deep tranquility. Those are sometimes referred to as absorption practices. Other words are used. John AJJ&A and so forth and the idea. There was to create a positive feedback loop. You focus on a pleasant restful experience. The more you focus on it, the more pleasant. It is motivating you to focus more that creates a positive feedback loop that Revs up your concentration power? So I've I've taken and I've reworked that system into a technique that I call focus on rest. Most People when they think about the word meditation. They probably don't think about concentration power. They probably think of something that's going to cool me out and well. That's stress stress reduction. I say you know, I'm stressed or the mind spinning how it but you just saying focus on rest to me that. That's like saying, I'm going to go to sleep. I'm you know, I mean? How do you keep People from going to sleep if you're focusing on something restful? Very good point now remember I said that I've taken these innovations from the past and I put them on a sort of uniform footing within the framework of mindfulness now. You remember, I defined mindful awareness as a threefold attentional skill set consisting of concentration powered sensory clarity in that point image. So let's see how we can have an experience that is very blissful tranquilizing. And would be a stress reduction cool out mellow out feel good kind of practice how we can have that as a builder of concentration clarity equanimity. Here's how we do it. I teach People how to detect create and focus on 6 distinct sensory. Flavors of rest of course I don't teach them all at once. I teach it one at a time so you learn the gradually one is physical relaxation. Another is to find a blank mental screen. Another one is quiet in your head OK mental quiet. But if I never have quite in, then just focus on one of the other ones. That's why I give you 6 OK sounds good. There's a high probability that it will be able to find create deepen and enjoy at least one of those, 6, so it's a numbers game. Maybe you can have quiet but you can have relaxation. Maybe you can't have emotional piece, but you're going to find the point mental screen. So it's I like to give People a number of options. So we find number one what they relate to and #2? What they find pleasant and interesting and natural. And works. So I teach you how to find create certain pleasant restful states. When your attention wanders you bring your attention back that's developing your concentration peace. The restful states even if it's focusing on relaxation in the body that's the focus so if my mind goes somewhere. I just bring it back to the relaxation in my body and then I'm increasing my concentration absolutely because you can develop your concentration with any sensory experience any experience whatsoever. That seems like a good way to go well. That's that was the idea behind the absorption practices that you find these. Natural pleasant experiences, so you're motivated to keep coming back, and it creates that positive feedback. So the your attention wanders you come back to the pleasant restful experience. Wanders again, you come back with more you focus the better you feel better feel you more you want to focus. Certainly this is going to Rev up your concentration power. The restful states like relaxation. Peace emotional peace quiet. Um or defocus in your eyes and so forth your external gaze you can defocus that produces a kind of gods felt as they say in perceptual psychology. That's uh that produces Alpha waves automatically anyway. The rest full states tend to open you. So that they create an environment where equanimity is likely to happen. You'll be less fighting with with whatever is coming up. So they induce. Equanimity the other thing is I teach you. Not just to cool out and mellow out, but to distinguish up to 6 distinct flavors of rest that sensory clarity.","title":"Focus on rest as one of the 5 ways"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/focus-out-with-fascination-stephanie-nash/","text":"So. Times ago, I focused. I think This is why did I focused on flow? So what I had everybody do was tune into the moving changing nature of everything with except. And it can be removing changing nature of anything visual, which could be we watched leaves moving and just tuned into the movement as opposed to that belief that's a branch. And there might be different frequencies of movement. The branch might move like this. While the leaves move like this. We just tune into that movement with the movement be a visual massage. I talked about how doing this driving around LA can be wonderful. There's traffic People right there's movement happening and you can just allow that it doesn't keep you if you don't start driving into walls. You still present, but it can create a kind of an acceptance in a massage in the visual field. You can do it with sound sounds are just moving and coming and going and expanding and contracting and you know there can be. Just different movement of sounds you can and that seeing and hearing out in the outside world, saying hearing in you can apply that movement of sound and they come and go to the talk in your head about this sound coming and going and getting louder and softer and it's just movement. You can do it closing your eyes with the images and we see we tend to. I have a blank place where we rust visually. You just close your eyes and it might be just patches of lightness and darkness and for a lot of People it's like a lava lamp. Come at the blob here and it comes in. But you can just watch that movement of it and let that be a visual massage or images come in for most People. It's not like high. There's a square picture frame. It's usually a vague, hazy subtle thing. Or maybe part of an image comes and goes out or something remind you or something and you can just and just like that movement of them and just coming in and out being visual massage and in the body. You can work with sensations, moving around breath is an ultimate movement to come in and go out and. There's how many different kinds of breath meditation. I personally have taught 1012 different ways of looking at the Brad Pitt, one way. I did was just noticing the movement. The expanding and contracting. Maybe the movement of air coming through the nose. Maybe emotions coming in and out of sound happens and who. You know where it's happening. I feel little movement of delight in my body or a dog barks. and I feel. Oh, maybe a little tension and release there or something so that we just turned into the movement nature and everybody thought Oh that's cool. That's fun. It makes this software and I feel like I've really meditate you know. Then the next week. I went OK. Now we're not. We're going to look at stillness really good space and rest I tuned everyone into. The same visual thing when you close your eyes instead of focusing on movement. Even though movements there, you're not watching movement, it's a place to park. We even worked with just a sense of space around you a space around things. To allow things to happen inside a bigger space. The real thing, that was an eye opener for a lot of People was auditory listening to silence even though sound is present. So we open out to the world of sound and there might be sound. Their sound there. But what if we listen to direction. There is no sound. Up tuning into that space and then maybe even listening to the silence beyond sound Ah. Huge space very expansive focus and everybody follow we've really meditated now. That's different than how we get so we had one week of flow and then one week of rust in space. So today, I thought let's celebrate solidity and this is also, if you got emails. I ended up putting it is the theme. You've heard of the power of now, right. Let's be present well. There's a way to tune in to see and you'll notice everything I do is visual auditory cymatic. Are we have five senses plus our thought process our five senses plus our thought process or? What tell us who we are when where why how we feel about it? What we want to do? What happened and whether that was good or bad in with all our judgments are and. All are. Suffering comes in and dies. Licenses plus I process and. You could take thoughts and feelings but the feelings will be in the body and you can divide all of that into 3 'cause I like 3. Trinity there's all sorts of wonderful things about 3:00 my meditation teacher. Shinzen young came up with this so, so it's his brilliance is. His ingredients I cook with and send always appreciation and gratitude to teachers. Always always always, I come from teachers and thank you. But he divides it all into visual auditory semantics your entire sensory experience your thoughts. Visual I see images. I hear internal talk so there's visual auditory to thoughts emotions are in the body and there might be a thought component, but that's visual so see here feel the other see out the world. We see into our mind we hear out the sounds. We here in to the talk feel out and Feelin Feelin will be emotions. Then we're doing subjective versus object subjective would be emotional sensations. I felt fear in my chest. I you know when you want to cry. Sometimes, when you try to choke it down. The Tongkonan gets engaged here and we've even got terms like cat got my town. I got a lump in my throat. I was all choked up. You know when it gets hurt eerie feeling behind the eyes or a wave of love of warmth. We might feel chest or you get embarrassed that might be a flush you feel up in your face and usually it's the front part of the torso, maybe into the face. But some People get anger down the back of their neck. The hair stood up on the back of my neck. We've got that phrase broke my heart right. We have all sorts of ways in which emotions play in the body and we don't we might see my harder. I couldn't stomach that or you know what will point to parts of the body. But it's usually kind of it their vague. It's kind of another dimension of feeling in the body. We can't say that was this organ. It kind of spreads and takes a certain area of the body and it's a kind of sensation just like. Earlier today in the meditation, I had you tune into a particular flavor sensation. The flavor or flavors of letting gum release. Your other sensation you could still feel your butt on the cushion. But we were tuning into letting go while in the same way Feelin or certain sensations that are emotional in nature. And if you're not sure. Stated but if you think they are you think. Every time I go damn it. Why did he do that might feel this clinch in here will call that emotional in nature and so you start to get to know where anger happens in your body where fear anger fear sadness shame. Those are the Big 4 People suffer and kill themselves. Everything something that I'm so. And then we have good ones. Lovejoy peace gratitude and they tend to be subtler, the louder ones tended. Hey, I'm here, but just like restful that we tune into that's a subtle thing. That's available at any given moment but no, I'm not turning into that I'm turning into. That guy cut me off the talk right so you can is a choice learn to tune into these subtle. It's like tuning in. A fainter radio station, but after a while. It's not so subtle the more you tune into it. The bigger it gets. You know that way. You literally develop new neural pathways in the brain. I grew up in the Woods. So I talk about taking a path in the Woods and I didn't like taking the regular trail. I'd always like to take a different trail that to me was funny is to try to get lost. I thought that was. So exciting that I don't know where I am 'cause I grew up in a small town where everyone knew you since you were born and just anything unknown was thrilling and and I do a new path and then pretty soon. I take that new path every day and that's my path and all the animals would take that path and pretty soon. The old one grows over right and then pretty soon. That's the main path well now. I gotta try another one, but I enough talked with neurologists an brain, researchers and at Harvard. Even the guys you studied my brain when I was there and they say what I describe as those paths in the Woods. I'm telling People that's a way to create new passing may have told me that is exactly what happens in your brain. That every time you have that thought and this happens up the brain goes there's a pathway so the next time that happen are that next time that thought happens. There's a higher probability. You're going to have that same response because it knows that path not because that was the best one, not 'cause that's the one that feels good. And then we have a tendency to associate familiar with what we like and those are 2 different things. And I learned that real big educ when we worked with battered Housewives, who would rather get hit, then go to something they didn't know. And they even sometimes let their children get hit, rather than go to something they didn't know because there was a life or death fear of leaving. It isn't rational. It has to do with us associating familiar with good. So, in that way. Today I'm going to be having you so today. I'm going to have you tune into something you? Do all the time see hear feel out? Fight you see all the time here, you hear sounds all the time feeling the body. Oh, I didn't do feel out in the body. Selim were emotions feel out as every other sensation. Every objective sensation that is not emotional. But on the cushion is feel out feel your tongue in your mouth that's feel out its objective there's no. Drama there's no emotion in it, the breath. That's one of the reasons we use breath meditation. For some People, 30% of People when you say focus on your birthday attempt to control it. They can't not and so it's an unpleasant experience for them. But People who teach breath meditation don't always factor that that can be an issue. But feel your hands. You can feel your feet on the floor clothes on your skin temperature, humidity, and air on your skin. There's lots of touch sensations that are not emotional in nature that would be feel out so today to be here now. Our dramas tend to be aware seeing here and feeling great thoughts and feelings up. I remember that. This happened, and I play it over and over again. We replay our traumas. We traumatize our self over right. Where is a safe place to go? Well, we can go to our happy flow place we did that we go to our happy rest place. Everybody wants to go to a happy place we can actually ground ourselves and the truth and the reality. Of allowing all of our attention. 2. So can too. Penetrate explore. What we're seeing? Now see here feel. We do it all the time, but what we tend to do is. See in here in general, we tend to let it all, be one thing. We don't tend to separate out see from here. It's just all this stuff happening and we tend to be drawn to and arising pleasant or unpleasant. A loud sound. And map the only time we separate here from C would be like music. Art and seeing New York let the arch feeling but then we'll have an emotional sensation to the art or something else but we're not separating necessarily deliberately separating the sea out from it. In fact, the internal talk, maybe going wild while we're seeing here and what does it mean to be right? But just focus in on the sea? Just focusing on the here. Just focusing on the field. Now. When you do this, especially with see out here out feel out, it doesn't mean. That if I'm just focusing on the CI have stopped feeling and I have no ability to you. Or sounds of all stuffed. Doesn't mean that at all means? I am selectively attending I have so much real estate in my consciousness and I am filling it choosing meditation. I'm choosing to fill my awareness with the rest in my body. Choosing to fill my awareness with the visual experience. So it's a choice to do it and at first, it may seem. Effortful. Well, normally ideas. Seeing here and field, you're making me. Just go there. Just go there and just go there or you might say I have trouble concentrating. I want to develop my concentration. Well my answer to that this is my yellow brick. Rd is fascination. I guided I think the week before last week. I think I did a 45 minute meditation on flow. I think last week was probably very fun. But I had a 45 minute meditation every morning that was 45 minutes. 20 minutes I said, OK, because you that. That means you were in a state of high concentration. What's that mean it means you? Were there and you weren't wandering off somewhere. You were there. Why were you there? Well, I happen to think it's fascinating so I share that fascination. It's like the fascination and I always say like a 4 year old with a lady bug. You know were for that. In fact, you cannot take a 3 or 4 year old an waka cross if this room were grass and a grass yard. You couldn't go from there to here in 5 minutes with a 3 or 4 yo because there just be too many interesting things to see. That is so cool like that Lady that he does not want its wings on my goodness and I work with people in chronic and acute pain you can look at your pain that way. You can look at your emotions. Oh my God. I have terror here OK? Where do you feel it? Where are the boundaries is a movement? Is it the same in the middle or on the outside. No one's ever asked. Anybody's classic on over you actually you know never to move right when you start exploring it is friggin fascinating and guess what the sufferings gone. You're watching the pain that usually assumes we start watching it stuff that often it turns into an enerji. It often presents its flow nature and pretty soon. This suffering is gone, but fascination this childlike fascination to explore with Curiosity with kind of an openness that to me. Isn't? Where we're going that's the yellow brick Rd to getting here? And so People who say I can't concentrate that fascination creates concentration. 'cause everybody who did that 45 minutes wasn't able to sit at home with 45 minutes without their attention wandering they were fascinating. They were interested. It rivets your attention. When you're doing something you really like you go in an hours go by, and you're not aware of it right. You like it so I say get fascinated you can practice getting fascinated that 45 minute meditation. Some People went Oh my goodness. I had no idea there was this anyone fair and then this or or last week with the rest. The whole notion of tuning into silence even though sound was there was like wow to People and then we went there and then so we filled 145 minute meditation with all these things to explore in another just with flow. And then another 35 minute meditation food just places to Reston Park in space. Every single moment of all those meditations is available in every. Every Friggin Moon of your sensory experience is freaking fascinating. There's so much to soak into you just gotta shift to that 4 year old and when I'm trying to supply is saying. It's like saying Have you ever wiggled your ear or little to no one ever tried it. No one ever said Have you ever done that it wasn't till my meditation teacher said. Well, what if you just look at that. But if you separate this, it didn't occur to me to separate. I thought my emotions were part of the experience and I thought, what I thought was the truth. I thought that voice in their head was me. I thought that was mine aeration of my life. The idea that the voice in my head wasn't me, I was just like. That's not who's driving the car, it's what's on the radio. An I can. Turn it down or turn it off or change the channel or if the novice stuck. I can just treat it as background sound like the water or traffic or birds. Never occur to me, so I was lucky to get a teacher to say, Hey look. Hey some other way, she contain into that. That kind of makes life better doesn't it? This all this richness and the question I get night. This was just on the YouTube video I put up. I had to free watch myself done, but some People go. Doesn't take away the beauty? You know you're looking at these ingredients. You know you listen that. Call beauty. Take it away. No. All those ingredients are available can ever given moment do you see the richness and depth. It's there, you start to realize that? What we've been looking at as a cartoon. Versus what's real? Which really there is so much more interesting and fulfilling than what we've been accepting as? Well, of course, that's what I think and that's what's there and what's there is which should be there. Or it could be there when I'm afraid is there right. So you know, I know one T choices. You know your thoughts aren't real right just kinda like that as we go. What are you trying to say but today we're going to work with so if you're tangled up and thoughts and feelings. We have a lot of ways to go. You can watch him flow. You can find a place to her breasts or? And this is kind of what some Zen practices. You can tune in to the grounded reality of the present moment of see here feel. And this. I have a lot of clients here psychologists and psychiatrists. Psychology field there's lots of isms and ists in there and. We've communicated back and forth a lot about using mindfulness practice and stuff with patients and and I've met him this in here before. But there was the person was trying to get a woman to tune into her body in a recipe. And this woman had been sexually traumatized and abused and so just going in the body at all was just danger danger will Robinson can't go in the body. She just doesn't have. She just hasn't developed a skill yet to work with there was so much there so. We said what if we went out to sound. So she went out and worked with sound and insight didn't even do the body at all, and develop this equanimity with it and men develop them. I from skills there that then when we could come back to the body, she'd already had those muscles. There's mindfulness muscles developed of clarity and equanimity and focus so that when she came to the body. She didn't get. You know if if stuff came up, she had skills for saying Uh This Is This this is this. And I can I can see and work with the skillfully too, then rewire the brain so that were not re traumatizing every time? Does that make sense and sound is here now, So what we here at this moment is happening in this moment and we don't really have a drama about it. It's not related to our personal issues. So if at any moment you're going. Oh my God. This is going on her. I can't keep doing this that's coming in his internal talk that's hearing in. Wherever your distraction is you can use your distraction to take you more deeply into your meditation. How? So if I'm hearing in I can slide out on the auditory axis here and every time I go my God. Person is rude OK here out in this out. Like you can think of it as some People want Oh. It's like an antidote and I go, Yeah, but it's really you're already hearing. You just sliding out and anchoring in the truth of this sounds. Rather than the one you're making up. Great and so when we hear sound sometimes we get images. And there's a visual component or thinking process that were usually less aware because we walk around their eyes open. But we all get image with her eyes open and if you haven't done this with me before I will demonstrate it so everyone. Look up here to the front of the room and see this lovely scarf, and really see all G she needs to iron that and see the texture of the wooden the light and really, really see it now. Look up in this direction and visualize your car, the inside of your car. OK can you see the inside occur you see how your folks is kind of went back to see the car and this is softer now come forward and really see the texture here. See that difference. We do that thousands of times a day were not aware of it. We're going back and seeing every time you get a fat. I'm going to the grocery store, you're going to see a grocery store. He said that you can see his face. You wanna go back and forth like that all day long so today. We're going to be working with that see this, if you find yourself going back 'cause. We're going to have eyes open at one point if you find yourself going into? Thing. Ground in this and really go up look for texture that's the fascination. Look for text every time you look try to see something different you didn't see before. Like the kid with the Lady book for walking across the grass that makes sense. Cool. Is her ability?","title":"Focus Out with Fascination  ~Stephanie Nash"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/forget-about-me/","text":"Shins and thank you so much for giving your time in Enerji today and always selflessly appreciate being appreciated. You had it teacher. Once you were saying that the way to show you say this at the end of retweets you see the way to show gratitude? What do you usually stay there said the best way to show gratitude to you? For all you've done, I would say. A couple of things. One is keep up the practice. The other is. Pass it on as they say OK in some way or another, either at the subtle level of your vibe in your behavior changes. Or at the descriptive level of you can describe your own practice to People and that's even though you're not teaching them in any explicit way they hear what you do and it. You can give a clear description of what you yourself do and that's a kind of very important way you can teach People or maybe at the fully explicit level. You pass it on by becoming a teacher. Yourself and actually teaching techniques, so I would say continue your practice pass it on and then the other thing I would say. What I would want from People is that they forget about me? I would want them to forget about me as a person In other words, I know that sounds shocking and confusing what I mean, is. To not link this to a person. An individual teacher. There's only one teacher 1000 armed goddess of compassion that spans all time, and all space and every individual teacher is just one hand on that face on that on her we tend to just. I don't know we look at the we look at the limbs. We don't see the whole goddess. So I would want them to forget about me as a person and realize that this is just one part of this giant activity. That has been propagating since prehistoric times. And some that link it to a particular personality what you got we just forget about me completely. Well, I'm going to express my gratitude. I'm going to go out and tell somebody about this and then I'm going to forget all about it. Not well. Thanks again.","title":"FORGET ABOUT ME"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/from-suffering-to-bliss-whole-session-guides-stephanie-nash/","text":"OK, so you mentioned you wanted to work on some specific issues. Anything you'd like to just tell me briefly about those issues before we start to work in terms of what it is, and what your goals would be in working on it? Yeah. What I'm working with now is a strong? Feel component that has. You might call it touch. I sometimes called secondary field with that tension that comes around the field can lock into quite a dramatic degree when it first arose it seemed triggered by external event. But what I as a response emotional response to an event. But I think it became clear that as I processed it that it kind of worked as a magnet to draw years. To? Who knows what other stuff up with it that matched that. Um. Emotional frequency and then for awhile now several days. I've been working with it there. I let go of their having to be any talk image component and it's just a huge amount of Field Which. I have techniques and ability to process but it's. Quite a a significant event an I thought Ah time to call in the big guns. An I thought you could help me with this and maybe someone could benefit from it help. Let me ask some questions so I can make sure I understand the situation. Ann you're having a lot of emotional type body sensation like all feel right. But I think that you're saying that you have. A muscle tension reaction to that feel when it arises when I think there's a very, very strong field and because it is so non stop. An intense that the body just starts to tighten around it in a way that I'm working not only with the field. But I have to kind of work with the tightening that comes around it. And so I might work with one then work with the other, but there's no question the core. It's feel, and everything else is just because it bends so intense for so long. The bodies just starting to and I'm literally now experiencing physiological. Things in the body just simply from that tightening around the field does that make sense and so you want to work with this sensory phenomenon. The underlying emotional sensations or feel as we would put it in the technical vocabulary body sensation. That seems emotional and then there's a kind of physical response in the form of muscle tension an that muscle tension. Some People consider that to be a fit a yearly physical sensation. But because it's so linked with the emotions. Some People considered to be in it to be in and of itself. An emotional sensation that we can parse it. Either way to hang on? What's natural for that person. I have a few other questions to ask you it sounds to me like you've already been working with it in the way that I would be that I would consider optimal by that. I mean that you're sometimes focusing on the tension reaction, sometimes focusing on the underlying feel itself, which is the general strategy of dividing conquer so and I've been I've been using a lot of. Flow is probably where my natural strength is and so and I can work with flow and almost immediately have some kind of response to that of going into it, but then it re arises in Rican deal. so I thought OK. I've gotta maybe more deeply or maybe you can just help me well probably the strategies that you are using? Are already optimal but that's my guess? At, it's simply a matter of continuing with them. But let's just do some interactive stuff and we'll see what comes up. I'm not sure that there's actually anything new to add content wise it may just be a numbers game of continuing what you're now doing but like I said. Let's see what happens do you have a couple more questions? Does the tension reaction that you're referring to? Does that? Tend to come up. In a pronounced pattern. In real time or is it more of an going sort of situation. By that I mean, is there a clear sense of they'll be an eruption of field and then there's a tension eruption of field. Then there's attention or is it that attention is sort of there. In a fairly on going way or does it tend to fluctuate moment by moment with the fluctuations in the field. I a little bit of the second a little bit of 3rd that the field is pretty continuous pretty intense. But there is a rising and falling depending on if I'm able to give it. You know if I'm able to stop and go into it, sometimes it might multiply and effect times 10 and become quite. More than what you wanted to deal with, but I'm assuming that's a part of the process. Sometimes my work with it will help it flow. The tension does not correspond directly to the field and I've and what I'm calling the tension is just from the field, having been so consistent. There's a kind of uh not breathing in a tensing in its creating stuff in the back end. So it's not really a moment by moment tensing. Physical muscle tensing around emotional body sensation. It's more, the result that the emotional body. Sensations have been on going for so long that you're getting this secondary sensation, yeah, OK now let me ask some other questions. The. You talk about the field, breaking up into flow and I'm assuming that happens with some consistency. You know whenever I focus in on it. Yes, that that's about the tension reaction does it break up in the flow? If I'm focusing twords that yes, yes that can break up Ken Break up into flow, as well. They all do kind of. Like a rubber band snap back into place a lot. It just feels like. There's just been a momentum of break up into float, but then they can re solidify so you can actually have the tension. And the feel both turn into flow with your practice can you have you attempted to do that during practice in motion like walking minute practice and so far pretty much? Yes, I. I have to otherwise I wouldn't be able to function. I wouldn't be doing this today, if I wasn't so you can already get them both to dissolve into flow, which is. Pretty but when I'm doing in action In other words, If I'm stopping and all of my awareness is going into that I can go total flow. But when I have to also do this activity or talk to this person or do something like that. All of my attention isn't on it, so there's some congealing. All you know, I can do enough flow to function, but I'm not you know floating on clouds. All the way through I do have periods where something like there's certain activities that help the flow. When I'm doing a laughing meditation or or when I'm facilitating somebody. I literally don't. It pretty much all goes flow during certain activities. But the rest of the time. It's having to kind of keep some awareness there in some awareness here just to kind of function couple more questions? Yeah. Is the? Which is? The source of the greatest distress is it the feel or the tension real feel absolutely so you're not so concerned with dealing with the tension well. That'll go when the field. So yeah, so the core issue is intensity of activation of emotional body sensation absolutely OK. That helps me hone in a little bit more on what are? Target right have you attempted? Well, I should say as you know a basic principle in mindfulness is divide and conquer case in point you have divided this experience into OK. There's the emotional body sensations. That's one component. Then there's the muscle reactions to those at the second component, so that's already a divide and conquer and that is already given you some relief that the average person wouldn't experience under comparable circumstances. As you remember a second axiom is if that, if divide and conquer doesn't work. Remember, what I always say subdivide until you do conquered in this case have you attempted to break the feel into specific flavors. Anger fear sadness In other words? Have you applied the noting feeling floating feeling flavor technique to this intense arising? Yes, I have? what I have found to be more helpful is. The investigating. Where exactly I'm feeling what OK it's a clinching here? What are the boundaries? Is there more pressure in? Is it pushing out you know? am I coming to the more I'm kind of investigating it without necessarily putting a label of the quality. That's been a little more successful in helping me go through it. The that I could tell you the quality the subdivide principle can be applied with regards to either the. Quality right which is the noting feel flavors so that gives you the spectrum anger fear sadness interest. What have you. But the subdivide principle can also be applied to the spatial aspect of things. So then you're from? Now let's just let it go just could happen during a real session, so divide so you can subdivide into. Flavors but you can also subdivide into locations. So it's an application of the same principle. So you're saying that sub dividing it by individual body locations has turned out to be more productive your location and quality. Of sensation you mean so it's a little. Both yes, I never an location getting specific about. Those yeah, so you've already made the major thing that I would first try because you've internalised the algorithms and you say that that does help do you note the location like with the location word face now haven't been doing that out loud? Been tracking the location and then it sounds like you're staying up for a little. While in a location naming my awareness around inside of inventory kind of what it's like when I'm inside of it. It's so much easier than when I'm outside of it. For me well that. Once again sounds like pretty optimal strategy. Tell me what are the range of flavors involved it's primarily fear flavor primarily to a almost terror panic? Play sphere an intense fear and there's absolutely sadness. There's absolutely, yeah, is there any reason for it or is it just erupting in the box. I have like? I said I think there was an event or 2 that triggered it on the outside, but this was out of proportion of that and I saw that and as I kind of worked with it, I found that the particular story the surface story. I yeah, even news, silly, but as as I let go of their needing to be a story. I kind of just wanted to. This quote huge feel an as I've gone down in layers. I'm seeing kind of flickers of like Oh fear of annihilation that I'll be killed in any moment. There's not a logical right in other ways. Internets not really coming from the object of external. I think it taped. I think whatever this was on the outside hula fear tapped. Everything like a magnet, I think it drew everything up that resonated at that frequency and it's just kind of really throw me at how huge it is an they say in Ohio, you juice was a huge but really it's it's taken all my technique or skill to be functioning, so we're having a huge upwelling of. Uh. Fear potential an sounds like sadness and are they equally strong. The fear in the sadness. I'd say the fear is probably it's probably like. The fear is the cake in the sadness is icing that's also going down through the cake food analogy actually that's probably a pretty accurate description because that's what happens they tangle and interact. And you say very little mental image or internal talked accompanying this first. There was a lot. But as I go down. It's almost pure body? How 'bout very subtle image or talk activation set liminal that balance of some with subliminal stuff is where that Annihilation came up OK that is starting to suggest some strategies. Let me ask you. Further I say annihilation, but the thing that comes up with big killed like like anybody at any moment could kill you know, and that's all but it's fear and this is good. You've heard me a million times talk about how before we break through. These things they need to become my phrases continuous and ubiquitous. Continuous means unbroken in time ubiquitous means everywhere in the body. And we have to going toys, if that's happening, yeah, then a process of. Permanent purification is happening so people of course. Are averse to the notion of letting something like fear sadness become continuous through time an Omni directional in the body ubiquitous through the body. But at that Penny Wise and pound foolish because being unwilling to pass through that temporarily keeps them. Always sort of Damocles of fear hanging over their head and likewise with the other negatives like sadness anger and so forth so. You have to reach a point where it's completely irrational completely over the Top intense. Doesn't stop in time and is in every cubic centimeter of your body if not of the known universe? You know In other words, perceived as larger than the body. And say OK I would allow this to go on forever. It's at that point that you're getting optimal catharsis in the sense of cleaning out. So what it's taking awhile but I'm getting a clearer hear me say that makes me feel better. You know, I mean, not I start work, but you know it's kind of just helpful to have somebody say, 'cause I've just been working on about myself without talking when you want in that it's really helpful to hear it. But just helpful to hear that you know, yeah, I would say that this. This is the stage before People become free. It's interesting too because when I had a physical issue a year ago, where I had excruciating pain in my body? What happened was it felt like my skin all over my body was burned with singeing very hot and the neurologist. Everybody, said it was probably in response to the pain. They couldn't. They said it's just your bodies into an alarm alert mode. That's getting activated by this fear so like I have that In addition, so you talk about hot Northland. You know, I've got that on the outside. This kind of thing in that that will definitely that directly corresponds with the intensity of the field, OK, so is that that's enough isn't it? It's a lot to work with, but actually I need a little more information do you think that it's? That is interacting with subtle levels of talk or image. Very very So what do you mean interacting by that I mean that fear? And sadness might be intensified by. Subtle subliminal activations of visual or auditory thinking. What I think is happening and this is just having been working with it now for awhile? I think it's like if there's a deck of cards. That's all the images and thoughts that we have in a pool that one hit something and it went down and if there were like little shavings of metal. I'm sorry. I went back away from deck of cards with shaving all of those came up in each one of those is an image or it could be image or talks stuff, but it's just like in so you might get little flicks like of popcorn, but it might not be enough. To go Oh yes, that's what that's when I was thoughts exactly and when that comes up. It can poke it can it can it can kind of like add a little little bit of a wood shaving to the fire, but it's like the feel called that up and then that might poke in the feel a little bit. But if I stay with the field. They just kind of hang out so the answer to the question is yes. There is interaction with subtle. Her Twitch OK is significant, yeah, and also characteristic of Catharsis. Although it may primarily come up as body feel flavors. Subliminal auditory and visual thinking often enters into the gestalt, especially the visual. Because People don't usually hear hell they usually see hell. Although in theory, you can hear it, too, but image spaces where the monsters are. That might be linked to all of this so that gives me some of the more information that I need OK now believe it or not yet more questions OK. We do as well. We gotta see what's really going on and I don't just doing your house? Yeah, Well, you would be very warehouse. MD is called differential de answer by huge diagnostic skills. OK, so. The let's see here. Have you ever had the experience of having strong fear that was pervasive through the body so dissolve into flow that it no longer cost you suffering. Yes. How about sadness? And every done OK, so then you've already done what we're going to be working towards but you're going to be working towards that experience. Yet again because it's a matter of I mean basically. What let's see 1234 maybe there's 4 kinds of human beings? I mean there's a lot of ways to classify humans right. But maybe one way to classify all human beings is. There is most human beings. Who have never had the experience of physical pain? Flowing so completely that. It turned into a flavor of catharsis rather than a flavor of suffering. Most humans have never had that experience so that's most humans. Then there are the humans that have at least had that experience once. OK. Uh. Then there are the humans that have had that same experience, but with regards to rage terror and more grief. That's a whole other thing then physical pain. In terms of what it's like when that breaks up so we've determined and I think harder. Incomparably, harder because pain is just pain. The emotional sensations have been honed by evolution to grip us and control us and destroy us. They've been honed by evolution for that task that's what the hell is hell is. Rage terror grief shame flavors that have become so activated that they are able to. Convince you That not only will this be all you ever experienced from now on there actually able to convince you that you never experienced anything else. There have that much distorting power, so that it seems like eternal in both directions. That would be helpful. Purgatory is when. You've experienced those sensations enough that they can't cause that illusion anymore. But they're still there and you're working with them. And then The Inter, the threshold between purgatory and Heaven is when it turns into flow. We've been talking about so believe it or not one other question besides feared sadness. Are there hints of any other flavors in there? Like anger or shame, yeah, I actually look specifically for them. I think the shame flavor. Can like if something happens in the extra word that embarrasses me? I feel that shame and that can trigger all this. You know it's irrational it's irrational to the present Bush told the shame flavor or is it pretty much we're dealing with. Sad and had if we call fear had hasn't had for alliteration. So I could use it. I know you go for it. 'Cause there's mad sad glad and had your changing my feel favors here. It's OK don't come back that will get back to health. Here's what's interesting you know that heat. I talked about in the body. It shares territory with shame and embarrassment in terms of the flush and so it can trigger it. So they all kind of interlinked in that way. It's all information that I need to do the guidance OK. Let's do it, OK, so take a moment to stretch up and settle in and focus for just a second physical relaxation into the pasture. OK, we're going to start by working in the fierce sad system. So at any given. Instance instant rather, they'll be exactly 1 of 4 states. Just fear just sad both. Or another. We're going to ignore everything else. We're just going to penetrate that one system of affective so much thesia. My wife talking makes sense. Quit until the last 2 words, I don't recommend I know Greco Roman for emotional type body sensation King. I love it. Though I know OK, so I'd like you to note fear sad fear an sad or none. One of those for it. You might fear Ansett or both. Let's use fear and said with a boolean. And and operation so will get the four logically possible states of the fear sadness system. Any questions about that. Out loud for stars. Fear and sad. Fear and sad. Fear and sad. Fear and sad. Fear and sad. Now go to mental labels, but thinking the labels rather than speaking. Is it still mostly both at the same time? Yes take up? Now we're going to work just with the fear. Um. I'm assuming that there is one or more areas of local intensity for the fear is that correct yes is it one or other several disconnected. There's probably one primary one that spreads out and it has little branches to it and then there's. A little bit of a journey to a secondary one for the most part. OK, so. The primary ones spreads branches how bar the primary. One is right at the center of my chest like right in between my rib cage? How broadly are the branches spread through the body. It kind of comes down around to the side and in there, but it kind of spreads out a bit like like the core center is kind of there in a kind of big odd shape and then there are ways in which I think it kind of reaches suddenly like subtle veins. Kind of going out around to the middle of my back, OK excellent detection skill. I'm assuming that the. Sutler ramifications are of less intensity? Absolutely. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to just work with fear each time you note, said I would like you to zoom out. To the subtle ramifications focus on them, only every 10 minutes. Add I'm sorry every time a note fear OK go out to the subtle ramifications and work towards perfect equanimity with those subtle sensations because there's subtle. It may be possible to have complete openness with them. Even though you can't do so with the local intensities that are at the epicenter of it. So we're going to use the zoom out option on the noting. You're going to zoom out. To cover the subtle. Spread and work towards perfect equanimity with that and don't concern yourself with the local splash at the center at all just with the global ripple in a rhythm with the mental labels of fear. Word fear any questions about that. No, you want me, I'll just repeat it back. I'm zooming out. I'm going to keep noting fear with mental labels. But I'm going to when I note fear zoom out to the sutler tributaries, so to speak of the. Of the experience of fear in my body, not tuning into the. Main Grand Central Station part of it. It's perfect. And yes, it by mental label. I mean think, to myself fear to indicate that that's the flavor and then you zoom out and then I'm just going to have to do that on your own for a few minutes OK. Able to do that pretty good. Yeah. Is there any hint? Our flow in. The global spread of the fear Oh yeah, it's pretty fluid. Yeah, it flows it, it's interesting. I kinda be flowing in general, but when I worked with this, it would it first I got like little bits of knowledge. Like I started feeling not other flavors, yeah, and then then a little ticklish. But if I just kind of kept with it those which is. You know if I just kind of displayed with them dissipate so you're able to get the global component in the fear flavor to flow. Yeah, OK. Connect flow spread into the local intensity. After that, you get a local global flow with the fear you know, I think I started to naturally start to do that and I think that's when the nausea started. I think my body. But let's go for local global so that means you'll remember that there's my Standard formulation of the noting technique zoom in zoom out screen freeze. So we're going to zoom both ways out to the perimeter. To make sensations, there an ride the momentum of a flow. That's there and simultaneously zoom into the core intensity and see if you can get them to get that local splash global ripple. While keeping the zooming so simultaneously zooming in and out. Into the core out to the perimeter and you're doing that. Precisely to facilitate. The spread of the global. Flow into the local intensity. So the awareness is moving in, and around at the same time, it got it. Slight you have a phrase that you came up with the lighting slide, both ways. You're going to slide out with your awareness and let it facilitated global circulation of fear and you're going to slide in and let that. A facilitate a local circulation of fear, so you get both the intense areas and the peripheral areas. As a single fear flow. I will look at little sense of that. Oh yeah, so that's That's a catharsis of releasing of fear it creates this kind of center of this. It's kind of a deep joy that kind of comes up the center, but then I get really hot, yeah, let the joy be there, then the Heat. Be there that these are all really actually stupid Catharsis And if the Heat produces more fear than just dissipate that interfere except that we're going to let go of the fear now and can set. And don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out what we're going to do right same procedures start with the periphery of these sadness flavor work with that. See. If it's amenable through zoom out process to an experience of a global flow. In the sadness. If that's feasable do that, and then go in and look for the local flow in the epicenter and you're going to get a local global flow in the sadness if indeed that's Sort of doable at this time, I'd like you to explore that do ability of that. With regards to sadness just give it up. Sometime. Able to get a little hint of that. Yeah, since the sadness doesn't have the same vein network of spread. I just kind of instead of since I didn't quite have the subtle area. I just want around the boundaries of that's exactly correct that corresponds to the subtle. It's just less widespread that was made the boundary soft and then treated that that's what I would have had to do so. You're able to get a little sense of that, yeah, OK good now. I'm going to have you. Do a fairly intricate concentration. Where are you going to attempt to experience simultaneous? Lee. A kind of River of fear. And a kind of River of sad. That flow through each other. Interpenetrating without interfering. So it's almost like you say that again Oh yeah right? There's the sadness flavor and it's a sort of like. Giant liquid drop that sort of expanding and contracting right right and there's the fear flavor and it's a giant liquid drop doing the same ascential dance now you know how. Like in ghost movie. You see that, like the ghost can walk through the wall right right, but goes passes through the wall. The wall gives no resistance. Now imagine you didn't have a ghost in the wall, but you had 2 ghosts. And they were both. Doing their own thing. But they could pass through each other without disturbing each other. When they occupied the same place at the same time, so you can have these 2 ghostly waves. One flavored fear the other flavors sad and there, so did dancing except in unlike physical dancers. They parts of them even all of them can occupy the same place. So they? They're constantly waving and the waves pass through each other without disturbing each other without developing pressure areas where they would clash does this metaphor makes sense. Yeah. Have you attempted to do this with the fear and sad not in this not this round. This may be the middle part of the missing piece because you could get them individually default. But then the next step is collectively default because if they both flow at the same time, interpenetrating wherever they need to without interfering then. They won't multiply together into over well. And that so the ability to have more than one flavor. And to separate the flavors have all the flavors flow and then have the flow fields. Interpenetrate without interference is a sequence that I take People through when they're going through big challenges that are. That are Poly Chromatic. IMO the Poly Chromatic. Body distress, meaning a lot of different colors in the body then we need to train. The colors to flow through each other time and into quickly dance, it's an interesting. Intimacy between them. It's like they're dancing through each other as well as with each other and to the extent that they're both flowing. You'll get an even more powerful flavor purification and and hopefully a significantly deeper sense of relief. Cape Cod House had coming. Uh. OK. But in Watson. When I when I allow them both to share the same space and not and I'm recognizing how I've been keeping them separate and keeping the line between them in an when I allow them to just kind of do that kind of joy. I talked about before with the fear it's very intense version of that and then it kind of seems to ignite this kind of. PT like enerji up the body and it gets very hot, but it's getting it's it's enraptured with fear itself is rather counter intuitive facial expression proves it. Yeah, it's really interesting because, as it does, I find myself wanting to comment on it, and I'll go up and talk and minute and then and then it loses it a little bit, yeah, in yet to come out. We've done purely in the yeah, it's because the comments and then it does it triggers of little tacos to go visit there all about it in your use of practice allowed you to say that in not sort of go down that yeah well. Press least motivation to kind of stay with this, it's kind. It's it's intrinsically rewarding no next step. See if you can have the fear in the sadness. Dancing with, and through each other with your eyes open. And it may find D focusing the eyes initially. Helpful. So we can maintain it somewhat into more ordinary experience. It's interesting when I. 'Cause I kind of go in and out here as I do it and I'm going to talk all keeping my eyes open, but I'm getting to where I'm horning in on the one specific place in the body. They both share in a powerful way an if I can just kind of keep track of flow there, letting it be, whether it's red or blue you know. It. It kind of helps maintain it with my eyes open market. And I'll see if you can keep some contact with that. Even after we make some eye contact. It may be a little trick here, but Up this. Is what we just did here is probably one of the missing pieces in the? Of the solution to the situation that you described not sure it's all of the missing pieces. I've got a few other ideas. Besides this, but I think for this is a good night for this session, one one. One Epiphany is where half price of admission. I leave that money on the table. The you haven't done this before this well, I remember. Inter digitation was a word, You used to use and it's so interesting as soon as you guided me on this, I thought. Oneguide somebody else in this. I'm glad somebody else in this but I didn't think of it for me. I was just holding remember to do this. You remember to get the flavors to do that. I have other People didn't remember that you could do it for yourself. I was just all my circuits were just so full. I guess or you know that goes to a very general principle in the way I set up my approach to meditation, which is that the assumption is. That. When People face real challenges. Even People without a background in practice if you interactively guide them will be able to have pretty dramatic experiences pretty consistently dramatic positive experiences. It is also been my experience that People that are quite good at meditation when they're faced with realize life challenges can easily forget. But all you need is somebody to do this right. Oh yeah, I knew how to do that, yeah, and then now you're set. You know this is one session. We don't need 20 years of therapy here. It's OK now. You don't know what to do so. I think that's excellent, but I will for subsequent sessions. Remind me that I had some other ideas of why can actually just tell me now and they're like nicely play it and go member. You gotta finish it so the other thing is that OK one missing piece was well. The 2 flavors have to simultaneously flow and through each other another possible missing piece. Is that you're getting significant interaction with subliminal thinking? Right and you might wanna look in that direction and the way you look in that direction. what I was going to have you work through work with is a special exercise that with all the years we've done. I'm not sure we've ever done. This one, but I'll ask you have. We ever done, noting feel sources. What that means is I have note if there's No Fear. You say No Fear if there is fear but it's not triggered by anything you're aware of you say just? Fear and then you specify if the fear has been triggered by fear from image fear from talk fear from sound field from site or fear from touch. Now we have never built noted fear. I call that noting field sources and field. I mean can be generic or specific that that was the next thing I had in the Hopper to try after this, because what may be happening is that you're getting significant triggering. From from other senses that are activating the fear in real time and usually what you know how I always say. OK, what is science in a nutshell? How much of what? When an where interacting in what ways and changing at what rates typically. I emphasize the what the where the rates of change, but some of the special techniques are designed to elucidate the interactions specifically what's triggering Watt and I find that when People are going through significant? Intractable fear experiences or emotion in general, but especially fear literally a few minutes of noting. What is triggering that fear in terms of broadly of the broad sensory categories so we could not detect No Fear fear but not a triggered by anything OK? Don't fear fear fear from image fear from talk and especially subtle image and subtle talk, the subliminal stuff. The way you know that's happening is you get a tug twords image space or towards talk space. No content awareness at all but the next instant. There's a spike in the fear and the body now. You know that the sun. Quite aware of having that yeah, the subconscious well. It turns out if you ask yourself if you constrain yourself in real time to note did it come from image talk sight sound or the physicality of the body 'cause. It's gotta be one of those one of those, 5 right that. Keeping track of the of the whole system somehow that vastly reduces the over well.","title":"FROM SUFFERING to BLISS (whole session)  guides Stephanie Nash"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/goals-rewards-of-teaching/","text":"So what is the most rewarding thing for you as a teacher. Not hard to imagine it's seeing progress of People that study with me. That's the most rewarding thing. Um. And that progress takes various forms. Some People experience little progress little pieces of progress. Every once in awhile somebody actually has. A major insight. So that's what's rewarding for me as a teacher's seeing the progress of the students. I only judge my worth as a teacher in terms of the progress of the student Confucius said not to learn is the students fault. Not to teach is the teacher's fault. I disagree. If. If the student doesn't learn it's not the students fault. It's The teachers fault it's my fault. In other words, it's the job of the teacher to make it possible for the student to learn. We can't say, Oh well, you don't have the right karma or whatever it's like if they're not getting it. It's on me, it's not on that. So to find the way to communicate with that, you're talking about communication skills. Well, yes, well so you ask nicely doing a transmission that you asked me what's most most rewarded in general? What's most rewarding is when the students make progress. If a student happens to have a classical liberation experience. Now, which happens occasionally the sudden kinds of things. That of course, is really, really good. So that's extremely rewarding. The other rewarding thing is for me. Is if I can figure out something new something that hasn't been tried before that works like you do on a daily basis is coming up with something new well go around with a notebook. I mean, I would say that. Although I've been guiding People for some 35 years I learn something new everyday. And I take notes on my own process. And you know every once in awhile I get these epiphanies of creativity with regards to how you can teach People. And when I get one of those that's really, really good. That's extremely fulfilling my try it out and it actually works. My ultimate goal as a teacher is that anything I have personally experienced. I could lead anybody else to that experience that's what I set for myself as as my goal. Goodwill.","title":"Goals & Rewards of Teaching"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/god-s-arrow-shinzen-tells-his-experience-of-enlightenment/","text":"It's very hard to put into words.

This guy, so it's I mean, I could try to amplify but it's going to be explaining the Obscur. With the even more obscure, yeah, I'll do it. I'm going to do it anyway, I've actually doing it as we're speaking. There is a word in Latin. That describes it believe it or not. But it is so esoteric that almost no one is ever heard this word. The only reference that you will find to this word is if you look up. The ecstasy of Saint Teresa. Which refers to a piece of sculpture that was done in the high renaissance in the baroque period by Bernini and it's this great classic thing from you know the counter Reformation Catholic art is very dramatic so it's Saint Theresa Experiencing. Uh. Um. Pervasive gone but of course. How do you how do you express' that in a work of art that's going to emotionally grip People? Well, she's shown swooning. And that it was hugely controversial work of Art. I mean, People were very annoyed by it and I'm talking about back in the? You know back in in this the one would that have been the 1600s, I guess.

Is not stabbing her he's actually removing the arrow? And what happened before the arrow going through that's called Transverberation. It's when. When the source. Creates a wormhole. From itself. Through time space self and world and back to itself. And so right now there's a wormhole sort of starts back here goes through here goes right through the center of your head and out the other way. An part of me is looking through that wormhole an absolutely sees nothing. It's just void devoid. But all around that is the color for my need to interact. Well, you know all I can say is that makes any sense to anyone then. I salute you and I just love that word like gods, arrow that goes through the time space Continuum and of course, how wide is that Channel, well if that Channel attains a certain width. You will enter Nero to some operti infused contemplation and you're out out out maybe 3 days. No movement. No perceptible prep a breath or etc. So to follow up as a continuum, then the degree to which you are. The under fixated wormhole and the degree to which there is a recognition of ISM is a moveable feast. Yeah, yes, the so that's the new that's the new paradigm gods wormhole. It's called Transverberation If you're interested. We could it's just an odd word for meaning when God shoots an arrow through you. So I also really enjoyed your saying what your day was what I heard. You say it's sometimes you live without source so that's that me to your book to look up the word source and there are many recommendations in your book to read about source. And how do you live without source during your day the same way I did before I started to meditate? 'Cause it's just the experience of an ordinary person that doesn't know how to Meditate. The only difference is I don't care. I have no preference between being in a deep state or just being agitated and you know bopping around taking care of business. Because actually think Teresa. Explained it perfectly she said. It's a window it's open all the time, but Well, not really sometimes it closes but you don't care because you know it's going to open again. And you know that with such certainty that you don't even care. The transverberation that you describe the other day that God's arrow kind of coming through with the shaft did that for you did, that happen. We did a video on YouTube about the key moments for you and you talked about the first one, where you reached around and realize you boundaries weren't there anymore did that happen like just suddenly that day or is this something that evolved overtime. Took 20 years from the first breakthrough with first breakthrough was that day. So it's 20 years after that, that I started to get the transverberation slowly develop yes slowly. First just a hint then more more salient.","title":"GOD's ARROW ~ Shinzen tells his Experience of Enlightenment"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/guided-meditation-of-expansion-contraction-by-shinzen-young/","text":"Hum. Once again take a moment to stretch up and settle in. The spine is. Iraq through balance. And alignment. Less through strength. That effort. Like a tree expanding to meet father Sky. Well, the whole rest of the body hangs limb and loose. Yielding to the contract if force of Mother Earth. This posture is born in between expansion and contraction. Therefore. The first consciousness, the Shoshin. Sometimes translated as beginner's mind. The first thing you experience. When you said. Exemplifies the ultimate goal of the practice. To give yourself back to the fundamental forces of expansion and contraction. We've been exploring. What I call surface? Expansion contraction, meaning manifestations of the source that are available to anyone. Of course, they may not seem like the source they may seem quite ordinary. Sometimes uncomfortable even problematic. A good doctor can cure your disease. Only an extraordinary doctor can convince you you were never sick. Let's review what we've explored so far. Will begin with the principle love increase or decrease? Something they can get more intense. Something can speed up. Something can. Get larger in one, two or 3 spatial dimensions. Nothing special about that its expansion, though. Affirmation the principle of increase. Something can decrease in the same ways. Get less intense. But the frequency of an arising can slow down. Or something can shrink in one, two or 3 dimensions of space. Let's take a moment to explore expansion and contraction in this guys. You may only be aware of increase or decrease you may be aware of both at the same time. Or there might, not be any such movement present in which case it's actually. A form of rest freedom. From those 2 kinds of change. The expansion and contraction in the sense of increase decrease may be in just one part of your being or in one modality or one location or it may be evidente broadly throughout. Your experience, perhaps even a sense that. There's always both everywhere. Sometimes the expansion contraction could be cyclic something expands then it contracts. Or something. Both simultaneous simultaneously both expands and contracts. And then they disappear. Sometimes the sense of expansion and contraction can be. Abiding. There is an internal. In and out. In part or all of your being. It's all good. It's all natural a certain amount of guessing and groping will be involved. If you haven't done a lot of this. Recall that one of the dimensions of mindfulness is clarity and one of the sub dimensions of clarity is the ability to detect. And this is a detection skill and noticing of a commonality. That may be subtle. If you wish to label the labels would be expansion contraction both. And rest or none. For an absence. OK, good now let go of that. And we're going to explore another manifestation. Which is pressure force? Often it's in the body but it could be in visual and auditory both inner or outer. You may have a sense that something's pushing in. Pulling in rather or pushing out, we're doing, both at the same time or there may be no pressure whatsoever anywhere in your beard. Instead of interpreting pressure as problematic, we're going to just think of it as. Of course. Let's moving out or moving in. Or moving in both directions at once. If it moves in both directions at once it might interdigitate sort of pass through itself. Or there might be a clash and interference. But there's no one to play. If the pressure waves just pass through each other interpenetrating without interfering. Like 2 ghosts. Walking along a Rd. Move through each other well, then fine but if there's a bang. Like 2 cars, hitting each other. Just have equanimity with that to the best of your ability. If there's no pressure enjoy the Freedom from pressure. It's a rest or a non situation. Typically, we have a sense, we need to do something about pressure. Emelia rated in some way and actually there can be times when that's useful appropriate. But for now, we're just going to observe it. OK dad now let go of that. Then we're going to explore yet another manifestation. Of expansion contraction. One, which is often interpreted. As problematic. And then leave is from a certain perspective, but from another perspective can be looked upon impersonally. And Blamelessly. As just part of the dance of space, you may be aware. Of. Your attention scattering. Or being flooded your pool to more than one thing at the same Top. Pulled in and out at the same time or full to many places in your body or pull to your mind and your body or your mind goes too many places. Scattering. Will consider that to be a form of expansion? Or you may be gripped and held by something. It won't let you go often we interpreted as I won't let it go. And that can be a valid interpretation, but we're going to think of it differently now. Your space is being limited held. It's nothing personal about it. There's no blame. Scattering. Is this? Part of the dance of space gripping as part of the dance of space. So if there is no scattering or gripping great enjoy that's arrest, State of Freedom from this aspect of expansion contraction. But if there is. You too it. Let yourself be spread. To the 6 directions. Or let yourself be. Nail down. Without fighting. Just taking it to be the flow of space. Seems like it's scattering and grouping forces. But actually it's just the curvature of space. It's actually an interesting metaphor. From general relativity. Little different way to think about things. OK, good. Now we're going to explore one more. Ordinary manifestation of expansion contraction. But I'll give you a little heads up there's some subtlety involved in this one. We like to get comfortable by. Resting in some center. Maybe we are enjoying thinking about a certain something. Or were Comfortable. In a certain. Sensory environment, we settle it. Or quote get centered. It is. Comfortable it's ordering. To be centered somewhere. Moment by moment. If we get ripped away from whatever our center. Might be. Or if we get. Not off center. That's interpreted as disorder. And it's often uncomfortable then we may scramble to get back to center. There's nothing wrong with being centered. But. There's something. Good. About. Becoming free from the need to be centered. To have a fixed position. Even for a fraction of a second. This next exercise. Will probably involve a considerable amount of guessing and groping and that's perfectly OK. Notice that as soon as you might find a center. Something is going to knock you off that center. Pull you to the right or to the left or in front or behind or above or below are in all directions at once. The pool might be visual auditory somatic all of 'em. Would be inner could be outer but as soon. As there is a centering. There's a decent rate. Who is responsible for the decentering? Who gives you that gift that sets you free? Is expansion? Something expands somewhere. And it could be very, very slight incredibly subtle but there's a force. To pull you off? Wherever the comfortable are lighting center maybe. Duties center. But Alternatively. It knocks the centre aware causes a gone. Or, a partial gone. Up wherever the comfortable center might be. When you're aware that you're center is being tugged. Or the rug is being pulled. That's expansion. Doing that. And the actual collapse of the center. The slipping of the rug. Under your feet. Is a form of contraction? The center will not hold. It dissipates. Will consider that to be a form of contraction? It's very subtle it's counter intuitive and one way having a center itself is contraction. In another way, the gone of the center is contraction. Expansion. Prevents you from getting fixated. Leaving you with The prospect of learning about a new ordering principle. Becoming that authentic human that has no fixed position. The disappearance of the center, however, is contraction. The force that causes it is expansion. Those forces are a primordial ordering principle that could never be disordered and to the extent that you have one foot firmly placed in each. You can. Travel. Effortlessly back and forth between Heaven and hell with impunity. If you're aware of your center. Being even slightly messed with. Interpret that as contraction and let it happen don't hold on. Move up. But also notice that's happening because of expansion you're simultaneously expanding and contracting. And it's liberating dynamic. I fully appreciate the words, I just spoke made me may seem utterly inscrutable that's OK just explore. In 5 minutes, 5 years. 15 years. 15 minutes before your death. They may be very significant. OK, good. So far. All of the aspects that we've been looking at are ordinary. Something gets more intense or speeds up. Or larger. There's an outward pressure for Sora scattering force. Or, a force that pulls you out of a comfortable position. In consciousness. For something decreases or slows down or gets smaller or there's an inward pressure for Sora gripping force. Or, a disappearance. Of the ability to hold a center. 50s centered not off center. Associated with All of the above. May. Be unawareness of deep expansion contraction. Or not. Deep expansion and contraction is a sense of space effortlessly spreading. Effortlessly collapsing or doing both at the same time. Or being perfectly still. No movement from or torrents. Deep expansion and contraction lies around behind within. All of the ordinary things we've been looking at. Sorry him. The reason for looking at surface expansion contraction is. It directs your attention to possibly detecting. The effortless dance of space that is the primordial great perfection. That proceeds. And follows. Each sensory and motor event and actually. If you understand deeply you'll realize it pervades. Eat sensory unloader event. From the good back to the good without ever leaving the good. Is to live at the source? To live near Fonda. Now let's explore the possibility. Certainly not the certainty. But the possibility. That's something like that might be available to attention at this time. Recalling movie associated with the ordinary stuff. Something gets more intense there tends to be a spreading. Something speeds up there tends to be a spreading. Something gets larger, obviously there's a spread. But sometimes the pressure could cause a spreading the scattering is definitely a spreading. And likewise for the conference. So sort of letting go of the sensory content and becoming fascinated with the spirit contour. Let's just explore the possibility that there, you might be able to detect at this time, the deep version. And if that's not available. That's perfectly OK just choose one or a combination of surface expansion contraction to attend to. Sometimes deep expansion contraction is cyclic. There's a both. And then a God. Of both of them. Both rest both rest cyclically. Typically, small pieces of experience are born in those small cycles, a niche here an image there. But sometimes the awareness of expansion and contraction is eternal. It's always both. Peppered. By an absolute tranquility. It's always. None. The reason it's always both and always gone everywhere is because. Of all those little cycles. They sum up. Do an eternal E flux and reflux. A formless. Fountain of youth. The formless spirit womb. Who is peristalsis births self and world moment by moment? It may just be an idea for you at this time. That's fine. But let's explore the possibility of it experience. Now in a moment we'll transition. From formal practice too. A bit of discussion. Decide. How you like to practice? Intentionally, if at all during the discussion period. You could maintain formal practice. You could have something so did going in the background, you could pepper it with micro heads or just suspend the involvement and. In enjoy the conversation. But make it a clear decision it's all good. Recall that the goal is to maintain formal practice at all times. Other than the possibility of during talks and discussions and such.","title":"GUIDED MEDITATION of EXPANSION & CONTRACTION ~ by SHINZEN YOUNG"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/guided-meditation-on-the-phone-any-for-beginners-www-basicmindfulness-org/","text":"But there was something you referred to earlier on in terms of. Teaching meditation to People on the Phone. And that piqued my interest of it and I wasn't sure I don't think I've ever heard of anyone teaching someone to Meditate on the Phone so could you just tell me a little bit about what you mean there and how that happens well wanted to create a fully modern delivery system. You know after I had sort of reformulated the techniques in terms of the five ways, which was one tier or level of creativity. Then I turned my attention towards the issue of well. No, I've got a modernized version of the classical paths to enlightenment. How do I make this easily available to People around the world and? So if you think about it traditionally. What People do is they do some daily practice maybe 1020 minutes but half an hour a day? What have you and then they do periodic intensive retreats? Which typically would be a day or a weekend or week or 2 weeks or 3 months or in Tibet, 3 years 3 months and 3 days in a cave, etc, etc. Some combination of day-to-day practice plus. Some sort of periodic intensive practice typically done with a group. Although not inevitably that rhythm of practice is the standard formula if you maintain something like that, then the passage of? Time will mark the process of Psycho. Spiritual you talked about how long it takes for this. For us to begin to see the results and you said it might be 6 months, 6 months. That's given it's that's not including this three month retreat thing? Well, now, you don't have to do 3 month certainly not 3 years. But I think that a person does need to do some day-to-day practice on their own. If only ice. I tell People, the minimum is 10410 minutes, most days of working on your own. Then, at least 4 hours of continuous intensive retreat once a month. As in what does that mean for hours of well. No, you don't sit without moving but you have unbroken practice for 4 hours, but you may get up and stretch and do things like that so. It occured to me that most people in the world are not in a position to take even 4 hours out to go to a center they have a family situation. They have work situation. They probably don't live near Mindfulness Center. They can't incur the expenses the lost wages. The travel expenses the expenses of being in a venue where you have to get lodging and meals if you do residential retreats. So a way to make the all of the features of group residential retreat available to anyone in the world and circumvent these problems would be to pipe it into the individuals home in 4 hour blocks. So that would be with a conference call. So no it's live. It's me or my facilitators live and so the way it works is you go to basicmindfulness.org and you register for retreat, the programs are always on the second weekend of the month. There's 1 two hour program on Friday evening to 4 hour programs on Saturday separated by an hour. And then 24, our programs on Sunday, so that's the second weekend of every month. You know that you can plan ahead. You have to do the whole no sequential no they're completely independent of each other so I could just do 4 hours and you could do or just 2 hours on a Friday. So it can be a shortest 2 hours on Friday and it can be as long as Friday. 2 four hour periods on Saturday until 4 hour periods on Sunday. So it's you've taken the whole weekend for practice and anything in between the programs are all independent. You register for them individually and so it's sort of like Dharma on demand. You might say you decide what you're interested in and it but it's all unified around the five ways are you sitting there holding a Phone to your head for 8 hours. No, you don't hold the Phone. You either use a speaker Phone or you get from RadioShack I hands free. Headset with a microphone cost you $20 and you put that replace your handset with the headset so that you've got a hands free operation. If you're going to do the programs with consistency. It's worth it to buy the headset or decay speakerphone, so it's sitting there your eyes are closed. And. You everybody calls into the number there's from 4290 People on the call depending on various factors. Ultra all over the world all at the same time, all at the same time? How neat is that many of them know each other because they've been an onsite programs together, because I also go around the country and run residential retreat so People know each other. Some of them, yeah, well they everybody introduces themselves so People, you see People thought well Gee. It's telephone. It's going to separate People, but actually we found that it very much. Unites People it creates a virtual community of practice. So what happens is it starts precisely at the posted time. But People typically call in 15 minutes early. And there's just free schmoozing and socializing so that builds yeah. That's the sound script. Ancient Sanskrit word, and that builds community and builds a camaraderie, so that when the guidance starts. Well, I I claimed to take the missed out of mysticism. and I don't like things to be mystical. SH Mystical, but there. There are some Mystikal's mystical things I can't really explain how that bonding takes place because after all. It is just People on a Phone. But somehow it's like you're in the same room. It's really weird. Just knowing that they're there and the fact that you've had this socializing before and. What have you it's like? Use it really strong and you've sense the presence of these other people's here, usually have your eyes closed most of the time anyway, so even if they were in the room. You have your eyes close. So yeah, you know something happens. That is synergy. That's more than I expected. So what happens is you call in and you choose the program. You want and every month. There is an intro program. So that you could start up any time and so this. I call it the home practice program. You get it off of basic mindfulness.org to register to find out about it, but the way it's set up is you can begin any month. You don't you don't have to there's always a program for first timers that's one of intro to one of the five ways and you can begin with any one of the five ways. So if I've never meditated before I can once a month. There, some way I can call in and have someone guide me from scratch. Like I have no idea what any of the programs that say Part 1. So focus in Part 1 focus out Part 1 focus on rest change and positive those are the five ways. All the Part 1 programs require no previous experience whatsoever great.","title":"Guided Meditation on the phone  Any for beginners  www.BasicMindfulness.org"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/guided-meditation-the-talk-feel-connection-stephanie-nash/","text":"So take this moment to let the bodies settle.

So that the head is balanced easily on Top. The spine is balanced the head is balance. There's no muscular effort or energy for the most part involved in sitting. See how you can allow the spine to lengthen and everything else just hang down from it. So there's alert. Alertness. An repose The lengthening of the spine. Allows the Mind. To stay alert. And the breath out allows relaxation letting go release in the body. With the face face off. And tune into the body what it feels like to sit here right now. Feeling your arms your legs your torso your head. Whole body. And they'll be tangible touch sensations of how the world touches your body. Clothes on the skin. Air temperature, humidity, pressure of the body on the chair cushion. These are all just sensations sensations of breathing the movement of the breath in and out. Tongue in the mouth. Eyes in the socket. Just take a moment to allow your awareness to feel the body letting the awareness circulate. And soak into sensations. Hands feet face. And if you find your mind wandering since we're allowing our awareness to move from location to location. You could always label. The name of the location where your attention moves. Elbow. Me. With each. Label allowing your awareness to move to that location, and soak into whatever sensation you feel there. Noticing the quality the texture. The boundaries. Is there a movement? And then allowing your awareness. To stay there a move on to another location. Becoming intimate. With body sensation. What you're aware of at this moment? And while you're investigating body sensation. You may or may not be aware of. Different. Category of body sensation. Subjective. The sensations associated with mood or emotion. Different flavors of feeling. May arise is different qualities of sensation maybe in different locations in the body. For most People, the front part of the torso up into the throat and. Facer Prime Central. Locations for emotional feel in the body. So unless you're absolutely emotionally neutral at this time you may or may not have the slightest. Tug pool. Spread cringe tightness. Warms. Of pleasant or unpleasant. The pleasant or unpleasant would be what we call feel feeling in. Feeling emotion in the body. And it might be quite subtle. Let's work. Sitting in a relatively neutral space. Nothing stimulating it. And you don't have to know what the feeling is but if you're aware of any. Such sensation will explore in a little more detail as we move on. But if you're aware of anything like that now. Just allow that to be part of your. Investigation of body sensation. In addition to the tangible. Face shoulder knee elbow. There may be something in the center of the chest. When? It's related to emotion or mood. Subtle is significant. Could. Now I want you to keep your awareness in the body. And I'm going to clap my hands. And I want you to notice. You will have a response to the sound of my hands clapping. But there may also be a literal vibrational response from sound coming into the body. So just notice what you notice. From the sound of my hand clapping keeping your awareness on the body. Feel that. External sounds play upon our body. All day and night. So I'd like you now. To practice, allowing sounds to move through your body like the body is porous. And open your awareness out to the sounds around us. And when we open out to sound image may get strongly. Stimulated. You may have images of the environment or. Pictures you make that you associate with sounds. If that happens and it probably will just let that be in the background that will be there. But really hear sound. And feel. The body's response to sound. Just like the clap, but maybe less dramatic. And my voice of course. Will be a sound too? Now I'm going to play some sounds for you. All sorts of a sociative thoughts will come in response to the sound. I want you to notice. Body sensation. Of a feeling nature or even just a tangible physical. Nature in the body. To the sound. Yeah. Pin into your body? Part of this is learning where you're feeling centers are different sounds are going to evoke different kinds of emotional field. There may be chatter commentary in the head or visual impression, but try to keep your awareness in the body. Is? Oh. Rockabye baby. I'm not eat. Oh, in the limbless. Back. Will. I am about. Lecrae to Whipple. And Anna come Babe. Great. No. Mad. Notice what you're feeling in your body now. That you weren't when we started the meditation. You don't have to up be able to identify what the feeling is what the emotion is. But notice any part of your body that feels. Pressure moving different qualities of sensation. Notice if there's a tightening around it. See if you could relax the body and allow it to flow through like weather. Emotions are like weather. Allowing it to flow through like the sound from the outside. What do you feel where in the body? Z. Allow Imageon Top chatter in the head to be in the background keep the awareness on body sensation. Noticing what you feel where? Allowing sounds from the outside. To come in and stimulate. Experience in the body. Bringing our awareness. To that sensorial experience. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Do you feel something different in the body now? Where do you feel is? What does it feel like? We just had a little exercise. In that you probably had. At least a few different emotional responses to certain sounds that were played. And the opportunity to notice where and how. Sensation in the body arose. Connected to that emotional response. Weather subtle. Or quite apparent. Now I'd like you to bring your awareness. To where you hear the voice in your head. Up towards the ears around the head wherever it is. And I'd like you to find. A word a couple words of phrase a sound a syllable to say to yourself in your head to help you really tune into where this location is the words can be of a neutral or positive meaning. And just say the word or words elongating the vow. And then taking a little space in between. Just to TuneIn. To wear that location is in your head to really here. End. And now I'd like you to pick content of the words pick something positive. Could be an affirmation could be a prayer? Could be a name? Could be just? 2:00 or however, many words or word or words that seemed beautiful or inspiring or loving to you. And really listen in. To the word in your head word of words in your head just like we listened out to sound. But also noticing any feeling response in the body. To that word of words. Now let it go. And just listen at that location. Talk may arise. Sometimes just looking at talk makes it disappear and less were deliberately evoking it for some People just bringing your awareness to that location will make alt oxys. Not for other People. It just rest your awareness at that location, and you may get clear words. You may have a subtle rumbling, maybe you can hear words, but it's like. Behind the door where you can. Hear the tone, but you don't know what the words are. Or maybe it's quiet and there are no words and then just enjoy the peacefulness of that. But just have some awareness in talk space. Whether it's clear settle or none. In terms of activity. And if Full for keeping your awareness there, you could even label clear when you hear cleartalk settle. When there's anything that isn't clear. And none are quiet. When there's no talk happening in your head. Clear subtle none. Not keeping some awareness in the body. What we've been doing for the majority of this meditation? Noticing sensations of emotional response. It may be neutral, there may be subtle. Things happening, you may be activated from any of the sounds that we heard. It keeps some awareness there. And some awareness in talks face. Wherever that is for you. Just for a few moments were going to hold the 2:00 and awareness at the same time you may feel a subtle little bubbling per clingen, one and. Maybe a little rise and something in the other, it may be nothing. You could describe or even understand what it is that's fine. This is the first time checking it out, it may all be quite. Murky with some groping. Just paying attention at all gives you. Gold stars on your chart. Begins that process of sensory clarity of tuning in. To what's really going on. Behind the curtain. Now, for the last few moments. We're going to play with deliberately. Evoking certain kinds of talk in the head just for you to tune into the response to the sound on the inside just like we tuned into the response to the sound on the outside. I'd like you to think of a word or words or phrase. Have something that's a bit of a challenge for you. You pick something that. You would like to work with at this time. So it doesn't have to be the most difficult thing. That you could possibly think of in your life. Just anything that might. Be a bit of a challenge to work with. Negative talk of whatever kind. Hear it. Feel the body's response to it, it will probably be a very familiar sensation. While you're doing this see if you can relax, the body. With every breath out. Letting go of tension, so that whatever arises. Doesn't get stuck just flow through? Like ringing a Bell it will ring and then it stops. Now let go of that talk. The feeling may go when you let go of The Talk, the feeling may linger. Just hear the sounds. Present right now. Allow them to flow through your body. Now I'd like you to think of a tune. A song. Any bit of music. With accompany meant from the outside. Any bit of music you find pleasant that you like listening to that you listen to a lot, that you haven't listened to in a long time. Even if it's just a couple measures of it. And sing it to yourself in your head. The part you like. Notice the body's response to the tune. And let the tune go. Keeping some awareness and talk space, some awareness in the field centers of your body. And the last thing we will voches something positive. Something that feels good to you word words phrase Name Prayer Montrae. Anything that makes you feel good. Whether it's love based humor based. Inspiring. Comforting. And here those words. And feel what happens in your body. OK, good work take a nice deep breath in and on the breath out let it all go. I just feel what it feels like to sit here right now and you don't have to do anything. You don't have to focus in any way. Just sitting Letting nature do the work.

That's not a coincidence Can you believe that that is not a coincidence to Benton is derived from Devanagari script of India Devanagari script of India is derived from the Aramaic script. Which has its origin in? What is not called lemon on? And so does HEB. And so does Greek and therefore Latin and therefore our alphabet also. Alphabet was only invented once it's one of the most extraordinary cases of cultural diffusion known. 1000 years ago, some very clever people in what is not Lebanon on? Figured out the concept of alphabet. And be it spread by diffusion all the way to Japan and Indonesia. And all the way to England just went around the whole eastern. Atmosphere basically there they all go back to one source. That's why alphabet from Alpha Beta Gamma Delta in Greek. Olive bet Gimel Dalad into coincidence anyway. This is Hebrew letters. And it says. I hope I didn't screw it up, I did it from memory. Also, Shalom being Roma, who yeah asset, shallow, a little they are curious rail we move on me so. This has this word. Shin La Mad Men. This is a really, really interesting. Ha ha. 3 syllables? The Arabic pronunciation is Salaam Hebrew pronunciation is shot home usually understood as peace, but it means a lot more a lot more. I'm not going to do it now, but in the past. I've given the entire talk about how the entire path can be described in terms of permutations of these 3 letters. Uh. Essentia Lee, It's not just piece. It's peace that comes through completeness chalen means complete as an adjective. Uh. And so. When you You've Have a complete experience of something OK, when you are complete with it. Where does that lead to it leads to the absolute piece of 0, so the process of completing. Leads to this peace and Furthermore, it has a connotation of safety and well being. It's also that there that's the Afro Asiatic languages of which HEB is one and so is Arabic and so is HE Gyptian. They they have a very different structure. There's 3 consonants and then the vowels and other consonants are permuted around that or positioned around that to create words and. More medical forms so. Just the Shimla Madman, there shall come alone and then you could put vowels in different places that you can make Shalom you can make Islam Moose, Lim and so forth so anyway. This is the special kind of peace. It comes about in my way of thinking through. Doing the activity of whatever it is and sure enough. I will say this means doing OK, so may may he or it. Who creates absolute peace? Who is really actually this is a present participle made the one who is creating the piece of Heaven. Bring peace to you. Ah. They are cold yesterday, yeah that's the part of my to talk about and upon all of Israel's so in mockery of understanding, which is my the way I choose to understand Israel doesn't refer to a tribe or a nation, I'd like to think of it. As the song gun, the community who struggles for spirituality because actually it's wrong. If you remember the story of Jacob's ladder etc. So you sort of means is from a root. That means to struggle. So I interpret this as meaning to struggle to get to God OK, so it has no political or ethnic connotations for me whatsoever within. This statement 'cause I cannot imagine any kind of blessing that is limited to one nation or one ethno's. So I just want to make that clear. I'll call you, Sir I'll very imru an say. That should be over there. Amen, which you know from English armband, so be, it something like that, so if you ever. Hear me sing. This during the meta you'll know what it refers to as a lot of deep meaning. Up. OK. So just wanted to mention that.","title":"HEBREW PRAYER a la SHINZEN YOUNG"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/how-a-living-bodhisatva-influenced-shinzen-young/","text":"Some of you know. Some of you actually knew Nicola Geiger. Before she passed away, so this is a woman that I've met in Japan. Who was German? And had lived through World War 2 as part of the resistance to the Nazis. They even made a movie about the group called the White Rose, so she had to go if it was like Schindler's list. You know, I mean that she lived in, she was only 20 years old at the time. And she just been through everything I mean, she's been tortured interrogated raped you name it. It it happened, many times. Anyway. Uh so she. I met up with her. I didn't know like who she was or whatever and But she said, well if you ever come to kill to come visit me. She was running friends World College, which is a Quaker. College that site has campuses all over the little. And she was interesting Lee engaged, she worked for Amnesty International, she was in fact, there. Specialist on human rights violations in South Korea. Which at that time was very bad on human rights violations and she was she was actually like? It was like this. Was very cinematic I mean? She was engaged in like secret espionage stuff because she was trying to save the life of kinda jump. Now you may or may not know the whole story, but eventually Kim did joke became the president of South Korea and Korea became democratised. But he was in prison at that time and she was doing all sorts of stuff with Amnesty International to make sure that he didn't get killed. So she looks like you know you would think someone that had like been through that themselves with want us on a distance themselves. Right but no anyway, so how this relates to challenges what have you is? I am So she says come visit me if you are very countable. And. So I wasn't guilty. I came to visit her and she said, like she said. Come up come up to my living room here sit down? Do you know? Why I wanted you to invited you to come here? I said no. And then she proceeded to tell me exactly where I was at in meditation. And what I needed to do to take the next step. That was sort of surprising, but then later on after I knew her story. She had been trained to Meditate from the time that she was 3 years old. Her father had had been a meditator. And they were associated with. With. Herrmann has said and the League of the Journeyer's to the East and this whole group of Europeans that were interested in sort of Buddhist kinds of things during the Vimar Republic. Anyway, so I mean, she's been trained that's why she survived. All that stuff, and prospered. She had enlightenment experiences. While these horrible things were going to her. So eventually became evident while she had these. This perspicacity to see through you literally so anyway. Apropos challenge, which you pointed out to me was that I didn't like People. And then I withdrew from People and that I was going to have to learn to like being around People. And it was true I had spent my entire life as a loner I was very uncomfortable around People. Uh. And. What I have in her was a role model? For what she was talking about, she was the first role model later on, I had others. But. What did she do well she just hung out in her house? And Uhm. Of. People would come. To be with her. What kind of People? Every kind of person. And the entire spectrum of humanity. From the best to the worst. All the best being the Zen Masters and. Catholic priests, she was friends with father Johnston for example, the worst being Yahoo some if you know what that is. And left wing international terrorists. Like the real deal. Um. And everything in between. Ah. Would pass through her living room and she give each one of them? What they needed. So. That was a big change in my habit patterns that I had to learn to love to be around People, and be with People might not seem like that big a deal, but apples challenge.","title":"How a Living Bodhisatva Influenced Shinzen Young"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/how-a-positive-human-being-emerges-from-the-source-shinzen-young/","text":"Yeah, I was wondering where cultivating positive or identifying positive exists within both gone.

However, the great parents, so intrinsically there is no love. There is no hate there. Intrinsically, but still that's hitting a human being OK. We're still in human being and when we get hit by the impersonal. That tends to trigger a sense of deep human love, but it's not intrinsic to the impersonal. It's intrinsic to the fact that you're still a human being and touching that. All which is You know as as his sets strikes down God and the devil simultaneously, OK, so you would think well. That's a little bit more like the devil, then God, but when when a human because it's like you know. Where is ethics wears long but when that's the central mystery when when the human touch is the non human the human is nurtured and improved by way of rehashing so that would be touching the non even source is. When you come back the ripples of love are there that's pretty much it. Um. So then the authentic person is in the source, but not in the ripples of love. Well be authentic currently authentic person. Is the puppeteer? The the The puppet that that invisible hand is inserted into. Um. Very much we'll be manifesting now love and compassion in the world. So it's the power source. Um. You can think of it on an analogy of broadcasting so there's there's the wattage of the station power that joules per second. That's rate at which enerji is going out. However, that the wattage is not the only parameter of radio or TV station. There there's a modulation that goes on. On that wattage that carries a message. It could be music. It could be OK and it could modulate either amplitude or frequency, but the point. Is there's a message that's writing on that Enerji Wave. It's modulated or encoded. Home but it's not the energycap way of itself, the energy wave is just pure enerji, but but so that's inside the puppet is that energy wave but the surface of the puppet. Should be? Uh. Should be unapproachable admirable? Helpful human being. That that's what I call classical alignment or Class C in like as opposed to crazy wisdom other things that People do where? They're not the surface is not necessarily unapproachable admirable helpful an ordinary human being.

May. Pacific way in which? Techniques for any specific. Issue. Yes, I. Found out recently or in the last couple of years that I am either allergic to codeine or it. Doesn't like me whatever and I was having some back issues an my doctor prescribed coding for me in a Tylenol 3. And I had said to her. I don't think I can take coding because years ago when I was experiencing Gallbladder problems. I started having extreme stomach issues with it and she said Oh that was probably your Gallbladder. Well, it wasn't in the middle of the night. I went in my stomach went into an extreme spasm. And I immediately started doing my practice. It escalated an yes, it became much more difficult. I actually sent my husband downstairs to get a CD. That was how to deal with pain or like I wanted Jensen to guide me. And while it was extremely difficult. I think it really, really helped I spoke with him. After that because even after my years of meditation. I thought I could do better at it, but But he was very kind and said, You know until some of these really, really big issues hit us. We don't. You don't know what you would have been if you didn't have the practice. Can you give an example of what you specifically did? I I did I did 2 things I did the focus away from the pain and I also focused on I needed both should send techniques when you're focusing away. I was, I was looking for restful spaces within my body within my talk space. I was focusing away from the pain by trying to find the relaxed. Rest spot, so that the pain wasn't so intense and then when we get to the point where the focus. I had to focus on it, then I was using focus on the pain and I was watching the intensity. The shape whether it was sharp or dull whether it moved was there a color to it that I could focus on to sort of that. You know that allows the pain to spread more. Can be less intense in one area that's what I did? I ended up going to the emergency anyway, but Yes, it's a coding something you discussed that work out of your system.","title":"How Cho used Shinzen's techniques to work through pain"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/how-continuity-of-practice-will-help-you-catch-fire/","text":"I'd like to start with just a couple practical suggestions of in terms of getting the most out of the retreat. I like to distinguish formal practice from what I call practice in life. By formal practice, I mean situation where you're attempting to maintain a continuity of technique of some sort. Um. It could be done in stillness seated standing like down or it could be done in motion simple motion or more complex motions exercise kind of motions, even doing tasks those kinds of things. But what characterizes formal practice is that it's all about maintaining whatever your technique is if if it's a technique that involves noting. And you're continually continually noting unbroken. By way of contrast in daily life. Often it's not feasible to do that. We have to take care of business. We have to allocate time our time in Enerji think about stuff and to deal with situations. So we Typically, in daily life can't. Have most of our energy focused on maintaining a continuity of technique, intentionally of course, as you know, I define mindful awareness practices as practices that significantly elevate your base level of mindfulness and I define base level of mindful esta mean to be how mindful of person is under ordinary circumstances when they're not particularly to try to be mindful so as the result of practice. Your base level of mindfulness should be elevated at even when you're just sort of bopping around taken care of business, thinking about this talking about that over the months years. Decades of practice. You should notice that just on autopilot. You're much more mindful even though you aren't necessarily intentionally trying to implement a technique so for daily life what I encourages. Something that I call quote practice in Life, which means that when it's feasable 30 seconds. Here, 3 minutes. There you implement a formal technique when it's feasable means well, yet a little hiatus like maybe you're an office worker. You have to sit there. You have to think plan have meetings, etc. But then you walk to the washroom or you're in a meeting where your full attention is not really required. And it's like OK. I'm going to do a few minutes of practice here. I'm going to do a few minutes of practice there and so you pepper the day with little micro hits. I usually encourage People to have at least a half dozen as I say. You know in daily life under ordinary circumstances. About half does at least a half dozen little hits like that. During the day where it's feasable you're in a simple situation. You're waiting or what have you OK now? I'm going to do a technique and then just go back to taking care of business. Now, if you make herculean resolve to really implement. It technique for those 30 seconds or for those 3 minutes, you can actually meditate. Retroactively, I know that seems oxymoronic, meaning of contradiction by nature. Oxymoron is something that is contradictory by nature mindfulness is in the moment? How could you possibly have retroactive mindfulness? Well, here's? what I mean by retroactive mindfulness as you're just bopping around taking care of business, not particularly implementing any intentional. Technique you're stirring up the some scars. Now, if you then stop on a dime. And implement a practice. You can replace quantity with quality it takes a huge resolved to do that. Though you have to really decide you're going to do that out, and then all those juices that got stimulated that got stirred up as you were just being ordinary and not even remembering that you're a meditator necessarily you can process. All of that. In 30 seconds or in 3 minutes. If you really decide you're going to bring. All you got to those few minutes of peppering the day so you sort of. Up. Uh. Get if you fully process, the juices that got stirred up by ordinary life that in a sense, you meditated retroactively because you've cleaned up or broken up forces that got stirred up as you would just going about life so practice. There's formal practice continuity of technique. Up and then there's practice in life and I divide formal practice into stillness and then emotion. So success on this path is likely to happen if you alternate day-to-day practice with retreats so here we are at a retreat. In day-to-day practice there's a little bit of formal practice that you do. Some People do an hour so People do the half hour. Some People do less is a little bit of formal practice and then it's mostly OK just going about life and hopefully you'll remember to pepper it with life with some practice during the day so on a retreat. It's a figure ground reversal. Basically waht you should aim for. Is from the instant you wake up in the morning to the instant you lose consciousness at night? For the great majority of that time. You are doing formal practice, either you're sitting or you're moving and moving could be walking. It could be stretching it could be taking a shower. It could be eating your meal, but you try to maintain a continuity of practice. The one exception to that which would be more like a practice in life situation is what we're doing right now. Yeah, it's fine with me if you are entering formless. Samadi's I'm talking and maintaining a formal practice and not listening to me in terms of content. That's fine. But you may want to listen to some of this content. Also in which case it's a little bit of going back and forth. Maybe you're mostly just listening to listen and it's just like ordinary things so interviews. Group process that kind of stuff that's a practice in life situation where you go in and out of technique. As you wish. But other than those times all the other times, chanting waiting for me to get here. You know what have you put in your clothes on taking a shower? Try if you can to have a well defined technique going? What technique doesn't matter. Whatever appeals to you under different circumstances. There's sort of like 2 kinds of People on this planet. There's the way most People are and then there are People that think about their day in terms of. Opportunities to cultivate and apply their mindfulness skills and it's just a whole different way to approach life. Many of you have probably read the don't want books that teach the Carlos Castaneda books teachings of Don Quan and so forth and if you have these great classic was written by anthropologists from UCLA who started to study a Yaqui Indian lived in Arizona and Mexico as an ethnographic study and. Eventually, even though he was a scientist and a modern anthropologist, he actually got pulled into the cultural view of that India. And stop being an anthropologist and became a shaman and wrote about it, but anyway. The native teacher that he calls dark one that's not the guys real name but? That person was not just a Medison person that it was not just a power healer kind of person. It's absolutely evidente abundantly evident when you read that material that don't one knows about impermanence. No self and emptiness. Yes, the liberated consciousness, which can result from those traditional practices. In some cases. So resign mentioning this is there's a lot of incredible sound bites in that those writings. One of the things that don't want told Carlos was the ordinary person thinks about their life everything in life in terms of. Obviously exact phrase that was used in terms of Fortune and misfortune. But the person who sees Thinks about everything that happens in life. As an opportunity. A challenge. A challenge to apply and develop a certain. State of consciousness so. Becoming that kind of person that sort of thinks of life that way. You can still acknowledge fortune and misfortune, but the day is more or less about. Cultivation. Uh. So that's really desirable. It's really desirable to become that kind of person. There one of the Zen Masters said that the average person is used, 24 hours a day. But the purpose. The personals, then uses 24 hours a day. So on RE treats its good other than the few times that were sort of talking and interacting and that kind of thing. Other than that I would strongly encourage you to attempt unbroken formal practice. So basically the whole day is just one practice. Period. I did a 2 month retreat, many years ago with open Dita who was mahah seesaa does sort of heir apparent and this is a traditional Mahathir retreat. Some of you have done those kinds of retreats you know everything. And I mean everything. Is done in slow motion? And there's almost this a little bit of one Upmanship, who could be the last person to get to the dining Hall. How much did you the dining Hall is obvious only about? 30 yards from the meditation Hall and there were People that you know it was 45 minutes by the time and this is everything OK. So it's a 2 month retreat so you know occasionally have to do laundry or whatever and it's like so you're doing your laundry in slow. Mo 2 hours. Do your laundry at by the way that's just who cares the wonder pets. And so. It's absolutely continuous practice set locks. It walks at walk walks. It walks at eat zit walks. They walk like that, and that's all you do all day suggests that you sleep for 4 hours, so that leaves 20 hours of noting practice to do every single day for 2 months, it's incredible so just try. As I say try to keep things going and be that person that sort of strategizes OK chanting. How am I going to focus how it's you'll have a clear cut study it could be a lot of things. Maybe it's a focus up you're going to listen to the sound. You can emerge with the sound. Or maybe you're going to merge with the physicality of the breathing of the chanting or maybe it's a nurture positive after all. That's what chanting originally was the Mont Rose and so forth you did visualization and yet the montre going. Or maybe it's like a flow or your rock on how the chanting induces restful states. Basically, a lot of our agitation is mental talk. An and Either an internal or external. Chanting kind of thing what mental Top tends to go in all different directions. But if you set up a kind of rhythm in Togus space where you're going all money plug my own Omani put me home over and over again, So what that rhythm does. Is it's like a comb if your mind is like her that wants to be a bad hair day and go in all directions. But you're constantly combing through it. These times of Almani Pod May on these syllables right. They make it difficult for the mind her to fly and all different directions and student do so here rest experience relatively. Even when your mind is wandering during chatting you'll notice does it kept wander as fast or as big so you can like go into see rest your rest feel rest I think going to flow states, when lot of possibilities. Those of you that are familiar with the range of techniques and you sort of decide on how you want to do it. This morning for myself for example, I was doing expansion contraction on it was so cool like it was in all three modalities inner and outer. It's just the whole thing was just like simultaneously expanding contracting. It's just sort of opened that was like you know interest opportunity necessity right so it's like OK. I think I'm going to go with this plan this morning and like OK. That's strategy. Other times, you might want to do other things, so how am I going to practice when I'm. Taking a shower or when I'm doing my meal. Fortunately, you get lots of chance to even get guidance specifically on that. So. That that attitude of OK, it's like. Keep keep the continuity, I would strongly encourage that. The one of the metaphors that the Buddha used for success with practice is he compared to getting fire by rubbing sticks together actually said In other words, it's an emphasis on continuity. So if you rub and then you like stop and then rub and then you stop well it's not going to develop? Something that catches fire so retreat is a situation where you can sort of catch fire, with things like keeping a continuity of practice going so that's something that I think would be good to consider and think about and try to achieve.","title":"How Continuity of Practice Will Help you Catch Fire"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/how-do-i-know-which-kind-of-meditation-is-best-for-me/","text":"Now there's different kinds of meditation. Somebody says hi I'm looking at a candle and. Somebody else is saying what's the sound of one hand, clapping or whatever, I mean? What's the difference. Really, in them, an what distinguishes them or what's in advantage? How do I know which one. I want to do it's a matter of trial and error. I would say you read about the different traditions and you see which way of working appeals to you intellectually. You also check out different teachers see their teaching style their personality their emphasis. Some they're all different summer very heartfelt. Some are very intellectually clear and precise yeah. I'm more. The as TS Eliot would have said the sharp compassion of the Healers Art and maybe a little bit. Less on the heartfelt side, but Everybody has their specialty so you check out the intellectual model are you check out the personality of the teacher or teachers. You can have more than one teacher so their confusing. It depends some People are not for some People that is confusing. But some People are naturally by spiritual or Poly. Spiritual yeah, you can be buyer. Poly for those People. It's not confusing so there is. The main difference in the different meditation traditions is what do they have you focus on? How do they have you build the concentration now typically concentration power? Is built by giving somebody an object to focus on and then when their attention. Wanders they bring it back and then it monitors again and they bring it back over and over again. Now I see typically because there are exceptions. Where you don't actually have an object that you focus on but that's Pretty specialized most forms of meditation will give you an object so most of them in object could you tell me a very good a sensory experience of some sort so give you a range of possibilities. Typical sensory experiences a person might focus on are the physical sensations of breathing. OK, OK, which would be a body sensation that is specific in physical that so the physical sensation of breathing is one common object external sound is another common object. You can do it with music for example, some People do a music based meditation focus on the sound itself. The meditation on the sound of the music another thing another sensory experience could be as you mentioned. Something that's external site like a flower or a candle your attention wanders you bring it back on the object could be an internal sound of a mantra, which is any syllable word phrase sentence that you repeat over and over again. That could be an object. It could be an internal image. For example, some People like to visualize like a sphere of light or? Something like that that they would look look at or like a blank extent of brightness or darkness, so that would be image type thing, which one of these you do is there an advantage to looking at a sphere of light versus listening to music or let me list. A few more and then we'll talk about the relative advantages and disadvantages. Let's see so we could have touch we could have sight sound we could have mental image. We could have an internal talk, but in the form of a syllable or word or sentence that is repeated over and over again, which would tend to cool out talk space. You know your internal chattering so that's called mantra in Sanskrit, but the Christians used it to most of the traditions used it so that image. Talk and you could even focus on an emotional sensation like a pleasant emotional feeling in your body like love or something like that. So certain kinds of physical touch is site external sites external sounds mental images certain kinds of internal talk certain kinds of emotional feeling the body would be typical objects that a person might take as a concentration everything potentially anything because you're training. Generic skill so you do have it does have to be based on sensory experience. You pick a sensory experience your attention will wander it will be pulled elsewhere. You bring it back and wander bring it back each time you bring it back it's life. Lifting await your strengthening your muscles you may get tired. But in the end your muscles get strong if you do that consistently that's how most kinds of meditation work not every kind. There are some formless kinds. But most kinds of meditation will give you an object your attention wanders you bring it back as to the advantages and disadvantages. I would say it very much depends on what appeals to you and what works for you as a person. So try out to see somebody like sound so would someone move from one to another like say today. I want to listen to music and tune into that experience and if my mind, wanders I come back to the music and maybe tomorrow. I want to watch this. Light in front of my eyes and I mean, or did someone pick. One thing that they're doing in that that's what you do every day to build this muscle of concentration excellent question. It depends on the tradition. You're working it because each meditations are organized into systems. And each system has an internal consistency. That is designed for it, so in some systems. You'll be encouraged to like OK. It can be today. This tomorrow that based on some sort of algorithm in other systems. It will be a much more monolithic. No matter what you always do this kind of thing like the breath I've heard a lot of People who do nothing then. That's the answer to the question what should I focus on is easy, it's always the same. No matter what comes up gently return to the breath sensation in your abdomen nostril wherever so it very much depends on the internal consistency of the meditationes system that a person is practicing in the teacher or teachers will tell you how to make those decisions and why and every meditation teacher should be willing and able to explain to you. Why they ask you to do things in a certain way?","title":"How do I know which kind of meditation is best for me"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/how-focus-on-positive-is-a-mindfulness-practice/","text":"One thing I appreciate in this formulation of the five ways. That you have honed is that in the years I've been studying with you. The role of what is now called focus on positive? Was not emphasized? A lot in retreat San when you formulated the five ways you made. This place for what you call focus on positive that includes it. We used to have some place for loving kindness. But this is this huge broad range of content that this covers an I wanted to know since you've been incorporating that is a. One of the five ways that you're doing. I wondered if you've notice to shift or any change in your students in the teaching and then you know if. How if that's been lubricating the experience in any kind of way or not? And it's definitely made an improvement. The idea was. Or I guess the central insight behind it wants to realize that all over the world. There is a FAQ vast range of. Practice is that all have something in common. What they have in common is they involve intentionally? Creating and holding. Positive content in your subjective world now by the subject in world I mean, mental image internal talk an emotional type body sensation. So there's a traditional practice that goes with mindfulness. Called Loving kindness. Where you do that, but it's in a certain direction. There's certain set words typically that one uses there are certain set emotions that may or may not a company that in the body and so forth so typically People well. I don't say typically but a lot of People don't like doing it. It's just like I don't want to turn love on like a faucet kind of thing or doesn't work for them. It leaves some cold at that moment. Or it brings up the opposite. So it occurred to me that well. That's a specific instance of a much broader. More general phenom. If you were to do cognitive behavioral therapy. They would have you intentionally create certain kinds of talk that was more rational and he would try to hold that and pay attention to that, even though irrational talk might be coming up. Some People are into the laws of attraction manifestation, the secret. Yeah, the power of positive thinking now. I don't comment on the validity or falseness of that belief system. But in fact that involves intentionally visualizing working with image space and so forth. For that matter prayer as it's traditionally done certainly involves talk space in in the Catholic form. If you're doing the rosary. You've got talk you're supposed to visualize certain scenes of the stations of the cross and so forth. You've got the pattern Oster. The Ave Maria and talk space, which is a Christian Mentre and you're supposed to have certain joy. Fuller sorrowful emotions in your body, so there working intentionally with field image talk. Laundry on a practice same deal. Athletes visualizing their perfect performance People visualizing desirable outcomes of success. People wishing Weld for other people in a general way. People visualizing their own improved behavioral changes in personal behavior. There's this vast range of things that People do and they all have something in common they involve working with one two or all three of the subjective sensory elements, not in the sense of observe but in the sense of actively create. And hold so it occurred to me why not just unify that. Give People the choice to do it in whatever way they want. And that way they are not limited and if they want to do a sort of gushy loving kindness. That's fine if they want to do a sort of a new age, magical thinking. That's fine if they want to do cold rational. Cognitive re framing that's fine do if they want to merge with an archetype. That's fine, too, however you want to do it. Just do it, but understand that in doing that. You are actually doing a kind of mindfulness practice see I I'm calling it to get that freedom. Now, yeah, so that's helped in an answer to your question is People having that freedom to do that. Now they can get into it. Whatever it may be, but from my perspective. My main interest in having People do this is as a form of mindfulness now that's not traditional usually the loving kindness and whatever is in contrast to mindfulness. But I see it as under the category of mindfulness because of the way I choose to define mindfulness. I define mindfulness as any practice that elevates concentration power sensory clarity and equanimity. And I would claim that holding certain positive content in feel image dog do you have to have concentration to do it sure so it will build concentration? You have to have equanimity with all the distractions of negative that will come up. Because when I teach it. It's not a fight between positive and negative. It's a selective attention to positive and what the negative just run rampant if it wants you're not trying to reject the negative and identify with the positive you're just selectively focusing on the positive so you are having equanimity with the negative. You're not pushing it down. But you're not walking on to it, either. So the equanimity pieces there and probably most important you're developing sensory clarity because. You're getting a familiarity with the 3:00 subjective space is not by observing them. But by actively creating with them. So it's A kind of active learning to become intimate with your subjective experience so from that perspective it false perfectly within the category of mindfulness practice. So it gives People an enormous freedom to do what's interesting and fun for them, while at the same time, developing the core skills that. Are the defining feature of mindfulness? So it's worked out very well.","title":"How 'Focus on Positive' is a Mindfulness Practice"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/how-has-shinzen-s-meditation-changed-your-life-choshin/","text":"So tell me about How long have you been Washington? 23 years my daughter was three that's hard keep track and she's 26 now. So, in 23 years I'm sure you've had a lot of experience mission sense techniques. Just off the Top of your head. Give me an example of how his techniques have changed. There might be many could just pick one. I have to say that often. Things that might have bothered me in the past, barely register on the scale now. So when I talk to People about meditation, I will say. It take it makes my tiny tiny little things very beautiful or passion it or pleasant? And then things that are huge emotionally reduce it too. Something that is very manageable or not or not there at all. But I I can't imagine. People living through some catastrophic things.

The highs and the lows. Wanna get add one other thing well? If if there was, I wouldn't say the most important but for me. The. Understanding of impermanence. Has been a huge? Um.

You will lose things you will gain things and then lose them that to me has been a really, really helpful thing in my life, not just for losing loved ones but also feeling a quantumness with well. This is the way it is today but tomorrow? Who knows so that sort of helped me through the. Exactly yeah, and I think it rules my life, a lot.

January of 2009 and we are now in January of 2010. And since then you did, all these interviews with Harper Koch on YouTube and you've had two whole YouTube channels. Now, full of videos of shims and out in the world has this changed anything is this affected you in any way, having all this YouTube presents. Now it hasn't affected me personally that I'm aware of. But I think what it has done is made a lot of very useful material available to a lot of People because we seem to be having People. Using this of course, we have records of all the usage. So I would say as far as me. Personally, the main impact has been I have a lot of very, very pleasant. Emotional body sensor at the knowledge that because of the service that a couple of my students have done for me yourself and Harper Cosh. Now we've got thousands and thousands of People making use of this and most of what I have to teach is just there in a very organized format available 24/7 free to the world Dharma on demand. Just gives me pleasant sensations. Have you heard of ways in which People may be using the videos that helpful thought up there? Are actually ways that I wouldn't have thought of I thought People would mostly be using it for conceptual reference. Occasionally, but apparently People are using it on a consistent basis as a kind of teacher in your home for their day-to-day practice.

Cool, cool.","title":"How Have People Used Shinzen's YouTube Videos"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/how-intense-emotions-can-be-no-problem-shinzen-young/","text":"Hum. The ancient Dallas had experienced the same thing. An and had an interesting phraseology for it. It relates to gene. Chi Shan, which are terms that you may be familiar with if you studied. Asian Medison or martial arts and so forth so Jin means essence, literally so essence of Watt well in terms of sensory experience. Often, in the process of completing an experience. A certain flavor has to sort of get distilled and dominate. Your awareness and that distillation of that experience. Could be described in Chinese as Jing or essence now in the Dallas practice. These particular distillation that they often worked with was sexual sensation. But this can be generalized to any kind of experience and it doesn't necessarily have to be in the body. Although sort of easiest to understand there, but the same thing could happen in visual an an auditory. You sort of. Everything gets distilled. So let's say for example. You are working on. Having fear no longer be an issue for you. How can that be? 'Cause there's so many circumstances. Of fear in this world so many legitimate reasons to be afraid. I just goes on Anon Anon? How can it be that a human being could become a human being for whom fear is no longer an issue? Broader still If you can do that, well why not? Add in grief and sadness. Or anger. Or on a more mundane note. That frenetic impatients that we have all day. That comes out when you're in a traffic jam. Um. Which is very ordinary? But actually a source of significant suffering in the world. And now at the other extreme. What you would hardly think? Any human being could ever. Come to grips with shame and embarrassment how about that one. So. Anger fear sadness embarrassment impatience discussed. Those are the Big 6 on the negative side. Of flavors of human emotion. I know for sure. That a human being. Can reach the point where? Those are no longer an issue for them. So how is that possible? How is it possible to do with all of those? How is it possible to do with even one of those well. Um. First, you have to be willing to allow it to distill into an essence. What that means is? That particular favor, whichever one. It is anger fear sadness each one has its own very distinct quality in the body. So. The essence of fear. Occurs when There is nothing but the fear sensation. It is in every cubic centimeter of your body. And it is continuous unbroken in time for a period of time now, we're very, very afraid of. What the consequences of that would be? But the fear of the consequences of that is actually what keeps us imprisoned for our whole life because the consequences of allowing it to become essence. In the way I've just described the consequences are. Nothing negative at all. On the long term consequences are. Freedom. But because we're afraid to let it go to that point. We never be very few People become free. So. If the **** really hits the fan to the point where. You cannot avoid. One or a combination of these negative emotions, becoming essence. Well. In a sense that could be a very good thing. So I repeat there is nothing but that flavor. In Essentia Lee hardly aware of anything else in the body. It's everywhere. And it's continuous through time. So now you, you are inundated with the essence of shame or. Grief or fear. Or. The impatience associated with being in a traffic jam and you're late to an appointment. That one is just about as hard to work with as all the others. It took me. Oh my God from the time I realized what the task was. Which is what I'm now describing to you? From the time I realized what the task was. To the time where I could actually do it. With that impatience thing in traffic and not suffer. OK, well, I don't want to maybe I shouldn't say this OK. 20 years, but the 20 years past, anyway, now OK, so I know what you're saying well. I don't have 20 years, OK will get that's another Dharma talk. I'm going to give a talk about aging. So, but the quick answer is. Aging is a natural state of no self so you got something going for you. But if you're young and have 20 years. Well, it might not take you 20 years. But it took me 20 years to get to the point where it really felt good. Like liberating. To have that level of essence with? Impatience. Um. Like I say if you're already old we've already got some things going for you and will talk about that later so there's hope in both cases. Uh. So. It becomes essence. And then It starts to. Get sort of Liquidy. Watching way che. The Essence. Converts into a kind of. Energi. That is first sort of Liquidy and then sort of shimmering and gashes. Um. And. Then. Watch E Way Sean. That. Becomes. This. Effortless simultaneous. Formless rich doing. Of space. Spaciousness. Effortlessly spreading effortlessly collapsing. And it's at that point that you have a complete experience. Of that particular essence. It is now become shun. Pure spirit. Now, as I say they did this. Traditionally, with sexual sensations. So it's the same process OK. The sexual sensation inundates the entire body there's nothing but that OK. And it's very hard to have equanimity with that. It's hard to have equanimity with uncomfortable things is also hard to have equanimity with intense pleasures, but And then it starts to flow everywhere. An and then it's sort of like. More gashes. And then it's just pure space and that's what the Tibetans, called dead on year met the. Non duality of Bliss and void. So if you can do if you can go through that phase progression. With just a half dozen negatives. It's a small list. Unfortunately, each one of those essences each one of those flavors. Has been honed by Darwin to control animals? And by Darwin I don't mean the man daughter, One I mean, natural selection over millions and millions of years, so it is very hard. 2. 2. Um. Allocate all your resources to having a complete experience of these things 'cause everything in the sensation. Says. I gotta do something about this. I gotta do something about this. I gotta do something about this because those sensations are have been honed by evolution 2. Make animals do something quickly about something. Either approach it and eat it or run away from it or etc, etc or. Make Love to it, etc, etc, etc. So it's very hard to just allocate all the totality of your resources towards completing but all you have to do is do that a few times. Or well, more than a few times a few 100 times. And then it becomes habitual, then for the rest of your life. You will have experiences in your emotional world that are maximally poignant and minimally problematic.","title":"How Intense Emotions Can Be No Problem - SHINZEN YOUNG"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/how-is-shinzen-s-teaching-distinctive-mathematics-taking-the-mist-out-of-mysticism/","text":"I'd like to define mindfulness as a threefold attentional skill said. Consisting of concentration power sensory clarity and equanimity so to the extent that I am a quote meditation teacher. I teach concentration power because that's universal to any form of meditation to the extent that I am a mindfulness teacher. I also emphasized the sensory clarity and the equanimity. Then there is the extent to which I sort of have my own distinctive way of going about mindfulness and that is definitely has certain distinctive characteristics. A lot of it goes to my background, I have a pretty solid. Amateur knowledge of science. And Mathematics and that has informed the way that I teach mindfulness in a very, very deep way well. One of the things that you learn if you get into the physical Sciences or mathematics at any kind of depth. Is you learn habits of precision in expression and thinking habit of precision that's correct In other words in ordinary colloquial English. Force impulse enerji potential momentum action and so forth. Then they all sort of sound like the same thing and we might use them interchangeably on occasion. But in physics each one of those words that I mentioned means something completely different and distinct each one is defined very, very carefully and in many cases, it took centuries. For those for that precision of language to be honed and perfected for example, in the area of mathematics. If you take a beginning calculus. Class you learn the definition of something called the derivative of a function. And you took that I did I. I remember those words you may remember some maybe remember mother function, but I can't remember well. You may remember an expression along the lines of for any Epsilon. However, small small there is a Delta such that if Delta the absolute value of etc, etc. Etc well anyway. That's the definition. That's part of the definition of the limit of ratio that's used to. To find the derivative in any event. It's defined with this incredibly subtle an incredibly complicated and you have to read it over and over and over and over again until it finally sort of registers and then after you read it. About 100 times. It's like Oh of course, so natural. It's so obvious. Now, what they don't tell you in your beginning calculus book and what would have helped me a lot if they had told me was that that definition of the derivative was not the one that Newton, who invented calculus used? That was the result of generation upon generation. Uh a good seventeen 1819. Yeah, like a good 250 years after Newton of the finest mathematical minds. Euler Gauss Koshy Fire Staas. I know most People have never heard of these People. But there among the mathematical geniuses of the Western world. Each one of them contributed. Something to that definition that the others hadn't seen. That's that is the. The distillation of 300 years of contention discussion and thinking things over. The end result of which is this. Incredibly precise incredibly powerful concept. Well, you get used to dealing with that level of precision and you get used to the notion that you're going to have to. Really think about the definitions and read and Reread and Reread Because. It's worth it. Because. An ordinary high school student who is willing to come back over and over and over again will be able to understand this as well as those better than those mathematical geniuses because there's stored wisdom? Is there I like to think of myself as. On a mission to take the missed out of mysticism. I think it can be done, yeah, it can using mysticism. Not in the sense of New Age Airy fairy. But in the sense of classical mystical experience as exists inside the great traditions of the world. Essentia Lee contemplative experience, I'm academically. I said that I haven't good amateurs knowledge of Science and math. But I have a professional academic trained knowledge of comparative mysticism, and Asian languages and Buddhist studies. And so forth that was my degree in Graduate School my degree program so I sort of bring a very strong scholarship background because of knowing most of the Asian languages in which the technologies internal exploration of the E are encoded then I have this. Scientific thing, which causes me to be extremely precise about how I define terms. People that work with me have to be willing to put up with that, but it saves them. A lot of time in the end. Well, they're able to eventually communicate and conceptualize the entire path to classical enlightenment. Precisely, in words. That's taking the missed out of mysticism. So you ask me what's distinctive I bring the Scholastic background. I bring a science background. And that informs the whole way that I teach and then. I'd Because I have this sort of Broadview of world meditative practice, I've created a system that is. How can I say? It is a framework. Within which all of the major innovations. In historical innovations in contemplative technologies from the past. All of those major innovations can be formulated within the framework that I've created. I call it 5 ways to know yourself as a spiritual being each one of those five ways represents a distinct innovation. That happened in history. But I've reformulated it into modern secular language. An placed it all on universal framework within the mindfulness tradition.","title":"How is Shinzen's teaching distinctive  Mathematics & 'Taking the Mist out of Mysticism.'"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/how-meditation-can-bring-an-enlightened-perspective-to-the-6-o-clock-news/","text":"Meditation can help you. Love deeply and in fact without it, it's probably going to be very difficult to love deep. In the sense that I'm using the term meditation can also help you act effectively but there's a lot more to acting effectively then. Just what meditation can bring. As many, many, many specifics. But the one thing that meditation does help in terms of acting effectively is it helps our actions. To be motivated and directed. By our emotions. As opposed to being driven and distorted. Um. When I lookout at the world and I see stuff that upsets me. Uh that causes rage terror grief shame a sense of helplessness. Which is pretty much? The 6:00 o'clock news every night. When I try to remember is in the end. In the deepest analysis why is this happening? There's surface analysis and that's important. But. For me as an individual in that moment. The most important thing is to not forget does it's really easy to forget not forget deeply? Why this do? Do is occuring and deeply why this? Do do is occuring this do do. Can be the only one of it of the gazillions things that is the litany of horrors of the 6:00 o'clock news. Deeply, it's not because human beings get together and try to create bad stuff. That doesn't happen very often. Human beings get together and try to solve stuff. But the solutions are typically. Driven and distorted by suffering. And so. There, some optimal now sometimes that's OK because one suboptimal in this way in the other sub optimal in this way, and they sort of cancel out and we sort of muddle through. So, sometimes, that's OK, but sometimes. A whole bunch of People will be suboptimal in exactly the same way and then it reinforces it turns into something horrible. Um. So I try to remember OK. How many millions of People for how many decades or centuries? Experience rage grief shame terror. And such just like I'm experiencing right now and they did not remember. To experience it fully. So it caused a drivenness distorted Nahs in their solution seeking. And the effect of those bad decisions lot of times they just cancel out. It's OK. But if they don't cancel out. They all line up, then we? Get horrible horrible things so I try to remember in that moment OK. It may seem like less than a drop in the bucket, but I want to make sure that I'm doing my part at the deepest level. Um too. Improve. The human condition at the deepest level. That doesn't preclude taking action at other levels, but for that moment when it hits me. I want to be able to have, I want to my metaphor, it's a little maybe? Humorous or made some even cavalier but I think the secret is is the opposite of the James Bond Martini. You follow the opposite of the James 119. You want to be stirred not shaken so I try to be stirred and not shaken. And I use the focus in technique that's sincere film. So that will that helps with acting effectively. But it's not I'm not in for a moment, claiming that that's the totality of acting effectively. But if that component isn't there. Then in some subtle way, and you might say well. It's so subtle it doesn't matter. But I think it matters. 'cause its qualitative may not be quantitative. But in some subtle way. I'm just part of the problem. I'm part of what made this. Um so. The love deeply part. Of doing something about the world. Uh. This practice is very relevant to that and the act effectively part. It's relevant also but it's not the whole picture by any means.

There's criterion that the Buddha gave. When his students, said well how can we know if something is consonant with your teaching? And that Criterion is called the public election. So power means existence and that sounds like the English word BD it's not a coincidence. So existence function, I is mark or characteristic. So I said, well if you teach these 3 marks of existence, then that's consonant with. What's all the foot does teach? So if you're interested in these kinds of topics. It's good to actually learn the Poly so on each are most of you know that can you say it? And after. Dukie pronunciation. So two guys usually translated that suffering and each impermanence and another kind of cell. These are the marks of existence. So. Not everyone in the world thinks Buddhism is right, you can go on the Internet and find all sorts of critiques and criticisms of Buddhism. Um. So I think it's important to? Oh, I think very clearly about these kinds of things if you want to be able to sort of. Untangle. Different things that People say, and have productive conversations. So because I'm pretty much. Oh, a logic and evidence based guy, I tend to think of myself. A rationalist Imperial Imperial assist. So I have to ask myself. In all honesty. How much of That. Kens can survive the critique of science? How much of Buddhism. Uh can survive the closest scrutiny and. You know last into this century and last for a long, long time. Uh. Would I ask myself that question in a? Problem. You know it very. Uncensored way. It seems to me that actually quite a bit can survive. Which is extraordinary when you think about it? Um given how old Buddhism is and so forth. I don't think it can all survive, though the scrutiny of science, but So. The parts that can survive are enormously useful and powerful. Um so time will tell. But. Let's begin with Duca. The claim that. Suffering is The nature of existence is suffering. What about this will stand the scrutiny of careful investigation and what might not. Well, First off where a little bit hit with a problem because a major feature. In the formulation of Dukie is the assumption that we lived multiple lives that we in fact reincarnate. And that most lifeforms are uncomfortable. In the West there is a tendency to find reincarnation of a comforting thought all I'll be in Garden. Back I'm coming back. But in India that is not a comforting thought at all. It's a scary horrible thought. Because Westerners typically always imagined that they're going to come back. You know well. They first of all the imagine they have been like Egyptian princesses, and you know, I was. The advisor to you know the King or I was a llama into bed OK and then the assumption is when I come back. You know, maybe the president of the United States or but the Buddhist notion traditional food is motion is that? Pleasant Incarnations are extremely rare. Oh someone was once asked up the biophysicist found one of the founders of biophysics physics? How Dane if he could discern any. Characteristic of God by having studied the mathematics of biology. Some of your laughing. You know, and his response was very funny. He said while apparently God has an inordinate fondness for beetles. There are more beetle species far away than anything else so. You know your your probability of your next 1000 lives being a beetle is very high, whereas being you know the vizier of the you know the pharaoh or whatever. You know, not very probable at all. In fact, even a fairly decent life where you get a chance to hear about meditation. And practice baby practice, it, but at least you've heard the Dharma. You know what the traditional metaphor for how rare that is some of you do. Well, there's there's a bunch of ones but there's this. Oh, this is piece of wood that's floating in the ocean and has a little hole in it, and there is a turtle in the ocean. And the probability that when the turtles. That sticks his head out of the water, it will go through that exact point. Yes, the probability that you'll hear the Dharma in your next lifetime. So of course. The lesson in that case is use this opportunity, OK, so part of the notion of suffering that's pretty intrinsic in traditional Buddhism. And always talked about is most forms of existence are uncomfy. And so the statement that did that suffering is the nature of existence is somewhat based on that notion. So. Is there compelling evidence that in fact we have multiple lives? Not that I can see. On the other hand, if it were to turn out that we have multiple lives personally, I would not be in the slightest surprise. Not in the slightest if it if the Buddhist tradition. Turns out to be absolutely correct in this regard wouldn't surprise me at all. But that's not really the same as compelling evidence. You know the Carl Sagan's thing about extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Hum. Now does it. Is it? How can I put it? Does it makes? Can I understand? Why someone would think we reincarnate? Absolutely. Because remember I've talked several times about these. Hello. States where you appreciate. The full extent of what happens in the deep mind moment by moment, even when you're just processing ordinary sensory experience. The deep mind in the limit. Spreads out to encompass this and as far as I can see. All conceivable worlds, it points to that I'm not saying it literally contains that but. It's a month of on it, it's like a fractal and it just. As you as you sort of look down into that where it's pointing to is all worlds and it is. This is called the experience of boundless conscious. And it's Part of the Java system. But it's not nothing mystical. She must've got something you can access just by. Observing image space very, very carefully. Oh, very, very deeply. And. With. It's You are that OK that's all in each of us. And it's very easy to identify with any particular part of that. And say, Oh yeah, I'm you know, I'm that part I'm not hard 'cause. We're all of it. So. Meditators People that have looked deeply within. It's Not surprising that they would come up with the notion of well jump from life to life based on your behavior, etc etc. So it's not an insignificant perception. And to come to the point where you have that kind of awareness that depth of contact with. How visual mind works is a very significant stage in practice? However. Is that hard knows me? But in fact, we, we have carted can, we show. Like. Scientists compelling evidence whereby they must accept this doctrine. Not yet. Maybe someday, maybe never. Now, maybe it's a little shocking to you to hear someone who works within the Buddhist traditions sort of say something like this. But I've been on stage with the Dalai Lama to bed like closer to him than I am to sync on right now. And heard him say if science should someday prove that in fact, there is no reincarnation, then we have to modify please. Imagine that that's the Dalai Lama up to that whose entire power base is predicated on this entire system OK. So you know if you want to gripe don't come to me, he's got my back. That's like really in. For the future of humanity. So. What about this notion that the nature of suffering existence is by nature suffering? To me, it's contentious to predicate that on the belief that we, we reincarnated and that. Pleasant lives are very rare. However. Let's see what we can say that more or less is not contentious that no one would disagree with. To what extent is suffering the nature of existence. Well. One of the things that you learn with this practice. Is that all the pain is? Unavoidable fit physical and emotional pain are unavoidable. Suffering is in fact. Optional. Suffering is what happens when you would experience pain without skill. Oh, when you have an incomplete experience of pain and suffering. To the extent that you start to bring concentration clarity and course. Equanimity major factor to that extent on. The pain becomes more poignant and less problematic, it still motivates and directs. It doesn't drive and distort it's part of the richness of being a human but it does not. Paul our existence. So when you look around and you realize that. Suffering is optional and then you look at how much suffering there is you realize that. And enormous amount. Of what People go through from the interest psychic to the interpersonal to the international level. Um and Inter community level in between there is an enormous amount of absolutely avoidable suffering going on. Hum. And that's I think. That gives credence to this view that. Certainly the nature of. Existence. For People that. Don't work ** themselves. They are entails. An enormous amount of suffering. So I think that stands the test of logic. And evidence. Um and it's important to know it's like hugely important enough. Oh. So there's that. There's also something else. The Buddhist tradition. Says that even pleasant things are on unpleasant. Which seems maybe doesn't does not seem to ring true to People? Um. But it's all a matter of thong. Uh. It's relative I guess might be one way to put it. What People call pleasurable? Relative to the experience of complete pleasure. Is actually? Painful. It's slightly uncomfortable. But you don't realize that until you start to have experiences of complete player. But most People seeking pleasure is intensity, duration and variety not actually that there's anything wrong with those things. But there's another dimension, which is that is not the dimension of any of those, 3 intensity in a variety or? Oh. Duration. There's another dimension, which is how fully you experience the pleasure. Um. Which is measured by how much concentration clarity and equanimity bring to the pleasure? And once you start to. Have some experiences that are starting to approach pure pleasure. Pleasure on alloyed with craving and aversion and gaps in awareness and unconscious. Alert pure pleasure is actually pure fulfillment. And relative to that when you look back at quote ordinary experiences of pleasure that you had as a non meditator. Or in the early years of your practice. There is a kind of coagulations intention around it. That is. Suddenly, painful. I'm so. This way is not. Obvious until you done better meditation. But I think this is another way in which the Buddhist claim about the suffering nature of things does does pass the test of logic and evidence evidence, meaning you could check it out yourself and see if it's not true. And relative to near Bama. Um. Which is the limit of complete experience? So complete that it is right on the cusp of existence and nonexistence. Um relative to Nirvana everything hurts. Um suddenly something sadly but suddenly significant. So actually. I think. Through this doctor him does pretty foot. About the Suffering nature of things. There's also the flip side, which is the nature of suffering which I've already. Sort of mention of at least the way I think about it nature of suffering is what happens when we have. Uncomfortable experiences. Um. Without concentration clarity and equanimity. And it's also what happens when we have neutral experiences without those it is also what happens when we have pleasant experiences without growth. Uh. This is so this is one of the first insights. That I have in my meditation career. Oh. As you all know I. I approached Buddhism. The old fashioned way it was old school it was Asia. An they you know. They made me sit in the full Lotus from flower and. From you know hour after hour that it was all about pain. It was all about pink. I thought This is Looney tunes, but So, but it was like so worth it because. Is sitting there and it's like it's getting worse and worse and worse? And then at some point. Discrimination vipasana seeing separate. You. Actually, see that the pain is one thing and the fighting with the pain. It's not. They are different critters. And before that, you never notice because as soon as there was the pain there was the fighting. So this someday some. So tricky lawyer is going to do some tort case where they're going to say. Well, this person is a Buddhist so they can only be recompensed from the pain not to suffer. I was always like you get pain and suffering right. Oh, I should put this on the Internet. So I don't actually think of this OK at your boots right. So we only going to give you half as much 'cause. We just got the paint and then the suffering I could be meditating. So you could see it, it's like so all my life. Until I started meditating. It's like well as soon as I have pain I've suffering with the same thing. And that's why the lawyers ask for you get paid for pain and suffering if you had a toy. But now I can see it's like OK, the pain is one thing. And my mental judgments about it are quite a different thing and the way my body tightens around. It is yet a completely different thing and Oh yeah, we can relax that that tightening and we can let go. Those judgments and then it's like does it hurt? Yes, but it's just not the same that discrimination that was that was worth? Every moment of what I had to go. Because otherwise I never would have known. Would go into some cut? Pain is one thing this up the suffering is the resistance to the pain is a completely different thing. And when the 2:00 come together you have suffering so that's the nature of suffering. Uhm and then when. There is just the thing without this other stuff is less suffering and then I extrapolate. It's like OK if. If diminishing the resistance, somewhat causes the suffering to diminish somewhere then. Where will this lead, well it is theoretically possible that there could be 0 resistance and therefore? No suffering at all, and that would apply both to emotional pain and physical thing. So if I only got that one insight in my entire meditation career, but still be worth the price of admission because otherwise I would have had to live my life without knowing Oh my God? How does anyone live their life without knowing that? You've got this sort of Damocles hanging over your head it can fall down anytime. So you know. So. There's the suffering nature, which I think has. Maybe not. You know everything that the Buddhist tradition says about that. It is valid, but I think plenty of it is when you analyze. Is that suffering nature and then there's the nature of suffering? Which is? Very very useful insight. And each of our answer, Duca or the OK, Uh Nietzsche impermanence what about that. Well. That's pretty evident. That. Things don't last. Um. And if we Kill of 100% of our happiness. On things that aren't going to last then we are definitely setting ourselves up for something. Oh. And what else is there to say about that, well a couple things actually. Uh. One of the criticisms of Buddhism is that? Well, because they that it encourages People to become indifferent. 2 circumstances object if circumstances because it's all impermanent. So. Why bother why care? Ann. And it doesn't help that the early Buddhist lifestyle was one of renouncing the society and going off and you know living sannyasi life. That means you. You know when you when I became a Buddhist monk in Japan is quite a little ceremony that you do you? Well, I haven't thought about this for a long time. What was it? Yeah. Cool, football, Google to Chica. Just remember it in Japanese. So. The shave most of your head except from cattle. Piece of they leave. And I could shape at the at the ceremony. Symbolically, that's the last thing you put on robes for the first time. I would have thought about this for a long this is like 1970. Hello. So. With the roads have really long sleeves. And I have. So they put these robes on you, you know you complete the sound when you get glass little piece of hairs cut off. And then you have to go like to this shrine area chance of Montrose and things and so I like walked out the door right and the first thing I did was catch that sleeve on a post at rip it. There is OK. This is mindfulness clothes. I've got an please close are designed to make you pay very close attention, you know just like. That's a good spot, but what I was remembering was that just before they cut off that last hair thing. There are 3 cop Camaronal Kokomo in Japanese of those. Scrolls that hang you know, or like long rectangular pieces of paper and you have to bow. Bow to each 1, three times to say goodbye. Goodbye forever. And the first one says Fumo. Full father mother. And the second one says Cocoa War. For one. The king of the country where the ruler of the country. Uh and the 3rd one says which he got me in Japanese. Chinese at work. Josh and your family God's. And you say goodbye that represents all traditional Society of ancient times in Asia? You say goodbye that in a completely? You are true jar, you have left shoot cat, you have left at all. That's got some the Oscar in sounds great. So. That was the system that was set up in. Perfect big in India because India is a very stereotype society and has had had and still has very stereotyped roles, so if you want it to be a transcendent specialist. This good news you can't the society will support you but you have to shave your head and wear the robes of a criminal you know the orange jumpsuits since like criminals. The same thing. And yet they met you like you're just out of the pale of society. We would just the whole different thing. Um so. Because there is that social model in Buddhism, you can see why People and then because. There's this notion OK everything is impermanent so Buddhism was teach People that. To be indifferent to circumstances and the needs of society. Um. I'm I'm criticizing to in order to answer answer. The critics OK. This is the stuff that you see on the Internet. Anti the things that People that don't like movies of this is the kind of things that they say about. Oh, it's like a? Uh. Because it teaches everything is any com pounded thing is impermanent so. Don't know the implication is why bother about compound things and besides is sort of the proof of that is these social structure of early Buddhism, which was just say goodbye to the world. No just because India at that time had a certain social structure. And that worked for the boot that does not mean there is anything intrinsic in the notion of impermanence. That says, we should be indifferent to circumstance. On. It just says that we should not pin 100% of our happiness on circumstance. Which I think is very reasonable? Oh, we should allocate a certain amount of time in Enerji. Thoards exploring happiness that is not dependent on something that is impermanent. And Unfortunately that form of happiness actually does exist. You. Often see a confusion between. Oh. The attachment or indifference with regards to the object if world. And. The attachment or I wouldn't even say indifference. I would just say People confuse that with what I call equanimity now and so my concept of equanimity is designed to answer the critics. And also to clarify things for People that work with in the Buddhist tradition. Um. The ability to let sensory experience come and go without pushing pool. The ability to do that. I think is a very important ability. Um. That does not mean? 2 things. It is the ability to allow sensory experience to come and go without involvement. To take a hands off attitude. With regards to the expansion and contraction of sensory experience. That ability does not imply 2 things that some People think it. Um. It is. A pretty radical thing. Because we're not just talking about body sensations were talking about mental states. Also, the ability to allow sense and nonsense to come and go. With indifference. The ability to allow physical and emotional pleasure and pain to kum and go with indifference with regards to how they expanded contract in your senses. That ability is very useful. But notice I said the ability. Because what People think you're saying is that you're supposed that you're advocating walking around all the time. Stop on that and their own. Equanimity is an ability. On. On demand when it's appropriate. To be able to have this hands off attitude. At other times. Um. You can absolutely take a stand with regards to your sensory experience. We do it all the time every time we do on Earth are positive. We're saying we're selectively attending to positive content. We're not just letting anything common, though, that's A. That's a different practice. And. Actually, the ability to let negatives come and go in the background. Helps us selectively attend to positive content. And even to be open to that positive content informing are being which is the nurture positive practice. So. The ability to when it's appropriate or when you want to to detach from sense and nonsense in the mind. Positive and negative thoughts, but can come and go without caring. Without or rather without pushing for the ability to do that. The ability to let pleasure and pain physical, emotional common goal. The ability to allow things to congeal and melt without. Um. Without preferences that is equanimity and that's a hugely useful skill to. But it doesn't mean that that's all you ever do just because you have that skill. You can take a stand you can reject negative thoughts. Fact you could do that better if you have that skill and the other thing that it doesn't imply is that you are indifferent to external circumstances that you're going to take a hands off attitude with regards to how your life goes or helping society goes. And I would claim that in fact, the ability to. Not interfere with sense with the way the world makes you feel. Freeze up enerji too. Take a stand. To make the world a better place. So. Um. Yes, everything in the world may be ultimately impermanent Ann. There, for 2. Pin your happiness on it is 100% is not a good idea, but you could hit some happiness on it is some limited predictability's in the world. On but you want to have another source of happiness when it's not dependent on impermanent things. Um. And. Oh. Be so. That's why I formulated the notion of equanimity and I always say it's a relation is a skill. That's a relationship to sensory experience and should never be, but confused with indifference to circumstances. But there's a deep deep deep reason why People do, make that confusion. Because it is not easy. 2 left my to just allow the world to impact on your mind body without interfering with that in. It seems like you're gonna just dial and it seems like you're going to become. Passive and ineffectual. In other words. The sensory experience of. Equanimity. At a deep level initially. Seems like it's going to make you indifferent and therefore vulnerable at irresponsible and so you're afraid to have complete equanimity. And it's only after you sort of gone over that hump and he realized no it doesn't work that way. Just because I have the ability to. It's experienced the litany of horrors that is the 6:00 o'clock news, so fully that I don't suffer. That does not mean that I stop caring. About. What I see on television in fact very much the opposite but? Some part of us doesn't believe that until we get over that hump. And so it just holds on and it's like no, I can't totally let this let this. Help me because then I'm gonna be happy. So. Anyway. Impermanence. So what is it? That we can have that. Will be a reliable source? Condition things on her. Impermanent well. Weather will talk about that in a moment. Oh no self. It's There's a very good reason to. Define enlightenment in terms of. Realizing yourself. As long as You don't get too caught up in words. Because half the world calls that experience that Russo. And. If you're caught up in words, then it's like he just he misses the point. You can't you can't see the liberation. In People that have FIA stick religions or People that are working within a Hindu context that are talking about realizing the true witness, which himself you know you can't see that the yoga sutras are talking about the same thing. That's the Buddhist sutras. You can't see that because the description is seems to be the dialectic up of the even the diametric opposite. If British Enlightenment is no self and someone goes around, saying self self self than they must be? Quite. The Skyland. No, they just chosen for. Very legitimate reasons to call back self. So I would just give that one little caveat. We don't want. The litmus test to be certain words. You want the witness test to be certain experience. Um. How it's been my experience that? There are perhaps. For different. Flavors of no so. Hum I like to. Use the This intersystem mental image mental talk and body in motion for a lot of different reasons. I like to use that to analyze. The simple The experience of self as a sensory system. Now there's other ways to chop up that pot. Is the 5 aggregates is the four foundations. You could broadly say well? Anything minded body itself etc? Etc for various reasons parsimony and a bunch of other Oh parsonline that just means. Simplest. Yeah, I'd like to use that system so just for now, we're going to work within that sis. Um. I always like to say that the inner see, hear feel sometimes react to the outer sight sound touch. Sometimes it goes off proactive spins memory plan fantasy. The individual elements interact. With each other that's why I'm calling assist. Assist. And then every once in awhile this, the interactivity just turns off. Sometimes it turns off because out expand. There's only a finite amount of real estate in consciousness, so out expands it in contracts and that's those famous said stories of master enlightening. An the master says come down. Let's see I like. The idea being for just a moment before there was the reaction. If you just love back OK, you see the system just went off line, the inner systems just swamped by the sound. But it's very hard to notice that. But if you said it just sort of watch. Either because out expands or just because the system just goes offline. When the interactivity ceases there's no sense of I. And if you're looking for a hearing or touching something external. And that continues unbroken 30 seconds a minute, 2 minutes, the inner system does not activate. Your identity just goes elastic it, you just start inhabiting what was formally out. So that's that's one flavor of no self. Another flavor of no self is well the system is activated. But the components at all of their fractal scales are completely on tank. Does remember it's not just one scale of image Top bottle Moshe? Inside and images all sorts of subtle talking body in motion and eat inside each one of those trends is like subtle. Subtle images OK and so untangling this. Multi scale scheme. Of inner see, hear feel as no small it's no small deal. But if you get them completely untangle. An emergent property. Called Self is thin vanished. And you know, I've given several metaphors for that. If you have red and white thread and. You just sort of tangle them together and look at it from a distance seems to be pink. But then as you get closer and look at what's actually there. The emergent property be illusory property of Paintless goes away. It's still red and there's white. So there's see, hear feel inner inner see, hear feel mental image. Mental talk body motion, particularly the self preferential stuff and in general, all of it. Um and it's all tangled together. And with sensory clarity if at all the scales, not just the surface scale, but it all the scales you get. Those waveforms. Completely untangled. And they are able to interpenetrate without interfering like solid Tom raise. On that. Gives you an experience of flow self that is unknown. I'm sorry that gives you an experience of. I'm no self that's based on. Cut. On paper. Untangling or resolution effect and this is the classic description of no self in early Buddhism is usually applied to the 5:00 aggregates. And I've given many talks. You've heard this many times the it's also done with the four great elements in early Buddhism. This is shocking. Descripcion approved again S just as a skillful butcher. Would carve up? A steer And at some point, the perception steer goes away and the perception meet arises that's actually in the Buddhist Scriptures. Clearly, they weren't vegetarians like 500 years ago. I'm at least. Someone OK so you chop it up and the perception well, just to extend the metaphor. The perception self goes away in the perception intercede here field clearly arise. And it's not nothing called stuff, so that's so if we call the turning off of the inner system, though self in the sense of it, you know, I sometimes jokingly call the. But no self experience that comes through fully untangling. I call that no self KMOWU so fully have known the components that it's another subject. On. Then those individual components can. Show you that their vibrating superstrings this of course, is just a metaphor again not saying it's quantum physics, OK, but if there's sort of like vibrating superstrings they're. There. They are. Vibrating space. Ann. Um. The whole sometimes the whole inner system, even if you can't untangle. The strands at all the levels. You get this sense that the surface activity in the Inter system is sort of gone away. But there's this undercurrent of shimmering on the mental screen. There's this rumbling and talk space and kind of idling emotional circuits. There's this vibra. Tori flow that's filling the subjective space. If you sort of zoom out cover that whole space and just sort of give permission for that interfield to shimmer. That will create another another flavor of insight into them. And then um. There is the even deeper experience. Of what's behind that shimmering field. Which is? This. Effortless simultaneous expansion contraction that I talk about every time I talk almost. Um. This is Sasaki Roshi called it mujou nor Ha Tarlac. The activity of Impermanence Congella Hockey, the activity of the source. Um. Push Oh no hataraki the activity of the brutal nature, they just all Simmons. Um. It's about impermanence is maybe it's Maine. Leaving. Oh. Because. It's like trying to pin site trying to nail tofu into the wall. OK, as soon as you think it's expansion. It's also contraction as soon as you think it's contractions also expansion. And it embraces. Um. It is a kind of flow of space. And. There could be a figure ground reversal. Um. Where it you say that well because that's what's? Behind all. That Phone. And that form is what you see, hear feel is made of. Then this is what? Hum. And that's where the I really comes in that we finally come back and answer a question. Well. If condition things are. Important. OK, so we shouldn't pin all of our happiness on the. Oh, we can put some happiness. But we should. We should allocate a certain amount of time and energy to. Finding. Eh. Happiness and ordering principle that is. Permanent. And that's where the little iron, we can be found. Because it is the activity of improvement. That is our two birthday. Hum. And since it can it does give us an experience of not only the inner see, hear feel, but the outer see her feel arising. Co arising. Not only does it provide that? Permanent. Fulfillment because even after the minor body die to the extent that. You said I'm not my mind, and body but I am this. And the activity left. Is responsible for my mind of them to the extent that you said that many many times thousands of times thousands of times a day during a lifetime to that extent, you don't know you just. Side swept and you just do it and rub about the around the. Passing away of your mind above. Um. So, in case could be made that therein lies. Perfect. Unknown source of happiness. But because it's not just. What molds? Oh, the inner world, but the inner sphere field once the outer scene. So it seems like you're always. Looking at. That with which you share root. You're looking at your your? The fraternity and sorority of creation are in your face constantly. And so that source of personal. Permanent happiness. Um. Is also a constant reminder to? Care about other People. Thus Totaly giving the lie both the totaly overcoming the misconception that People would do this practice become indifferent to the plight of others.","title":"How Much of Buddhism Can Survive the Scrutiny of Science"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/how-shinzen-became-involved-in-native-american-spirituality/","text":"You do Native American SER. I'd be interested in how you got into that and also how that fits into the Buddhist doing the ritual ceremony? How these 2 practices are compatible for you, sure the way it started was G. I'm thinking. Maybe at least 25 maybe 30 years ago, I was running retreats in the Tucson area at a ranch that was owned by a man named Doug Boyd. 3rd Point's father is very famous his name is Elmer Green and he's one of The Pioneers in brain wave biofeedback actually. And Doug had this ranch that he let us use to run our mindfulness retreats. So the first time we did a retreat out there in him to me at the beginning of the retreat and he said. You know, I grew up in Asia and I've always wanted to bring good representatives of Asian spirituality. Together with good representatives of the native spirituality of this area. the American Indians from this area, the Arizona area. And he tells me he's got a friend named Rupert Encina's who he describes as a pipe Holder. A Sweat Lodge leader and a sundancer. And I had no idea what any of those things implied but the way he said it. It sounded like it was important, and a big deal. And then he says that if you want at the end of the retreat, he will run a sweat lodge ceremony for your group. So I asked him to describe the Sweat Lodge ceremony and he did, and it sounded like well that could be interesting. So that's what happened when the retreat was over. We told People anybody. That's interested. You can stay on one of the local Native American, a spiritual leaders named Rupert Encina's is going to take us through a traditional ceremony called The Sweat Lodge. And a bunch of People did elect to stay so we did this. I remember vividly what that experience was. It impacted at all levels. I was just amazed I was amazed at how subtle and multi leveled this thing was. On the surface, it was sort of like just a physical thing. Hey, we're in a sauna here. We're kind of like sweating for maybe even health purposes. So they had a surface level of maybe a physical cleansing paradigm. Then deeper level, it's a religious ceremony, you're praying and so forth. It's also a group psychotherapy where People are bearing their souls manner, crying its boundaries in the inner visions breakdown here. Sort of all together in this small hot area and it's dark and women are wearing just cotton dresses. Men are in their bathing trunks very intimate very close. There are these intense physical sensations from the heat or whatever, so it's opening People up it's a group psychotherapy. Whatever anybody says everybody supports them, they say that's good, you know, or washed and all that's good or. Hatchet hatchet and it's like yeah, you know, so be it. So it's like this huge supportive environment where People are just letting all this psychological material out so it's like a group process. A group therapy group psychotherapy and another level. It's a shamanic journey because the intensity of the heat and whatever you're starting to go into the power rounds and see spirits in the rocks and so forth and another level. It matches the Buddhist paradigm of purification equals intensity multiplied by equanimity so you're in this ceremonial context. And within that context everything has become very simple. It's very formulaic so there's nothing to do. But just open up be focused and be quantumness with the heat and whatever emotions may be coming up so the basic boot is paradigm is. Intensity plus Equanimity equals flavor of purification and sure enough, native People call this a purification ceremony. So I could see how it worked at that level. And then at a symbolic level. It was the whole idea of expansion and contraction. The interplay of Father Sky and mother Earth. The pipe has the long stem, but it has the Earth Bowl, you could see every single thing that they did have that fundamental sense of a simelton 80 of affirmation negation expansion contraction. So, In other words, it incorporated all of these levels simultaneously into one ceremony. So I remember when we it was intense and I'm sort of like crawling out. You know half passed out the first thought that went through my mind is and this was a facetious thought it had a facetious tone. The thought was this is what they mean by primitive religion. And the primitive was in quotes because of course, it was the antithesis of primitive. It was so multilayered and so subtle and so integrated I guess. When the Europeans came here they saw that material culture was primitive located a stone. Axe is not as good as a steel. Axe so they just assume that the People were primitive in all ways and that their religion, was primitive. It was amazing that they were able to do all these things at once. In woven into this integrated experience so I got out of there and I just knew this is for me. And that's how I got involved. And if I were to say the relationship between the Native American path and the Buddhist path. I would say that it's a complementarity. They they both move you in the direction of concentration and equanimity. But the Buddhist one is sort of like it's very systematic that's good. But it's sort of a very personal experience. And it's sort of not all that, flamboyant or fun. You just sort of sitting there, you know dealing with stuff. Whereas the native ceremonies are shared there's a social context and it's fonder your singing and you're talking in your home. You talk, for Yala, seeing you know you could just like let it all hang out you get to learn another language, yeah, when you're singing and your drumming. It's sort of flashy and an interesting so I would say for me. the Buddhist practice is the substance that will always be the cake. But I like to have some frosty and that's the Native American ceremonies. Open.","title":"How Shinzen Became Involved in Native American Spirituality"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/how-shinzen-broke-through-an-addiction/","text":"There's one other experience that was very dramatic when I did my first. Retreat in the robot Ken Method, which is body sweeping at that time, I'd had a 10 year very intense addiction of marijuana. And but they won't let you use substances? Which is fine. I made that I was sweeping through my body and I notice this very subtle little discomfort around my lungs and whatever no big deal, but knew it was sort of associated with maybe all the small guy was booting in there. But nothing intense no thoughts about it or whatever when I came back from that retreat. Apparently, the part of my body that was enjoying the marijuana on the part of my body that was being damaged by the marijuana communicated below the threshold of awareness because I had. Sort of. Clarified the body for the body and nothing to do with my mind whatsoever. But when I went home. That addiction disappeared spontaneously and never came back. And that was very impressive you know it's like wow. I didn't have to struggle. There was no on the wagon off the wagon kind of stuff or struggling with it, it was gone. My body had decided was this before or after the. No boundaries exposure. There's no boundaries doesn't guarantee that your bad habits go away. You spend the rest of your life refining yourself. So I would say yeah, those 4 over a period of 40 years. That's like one per decade, there's are good ones, so there's every 10 years.","title":"How Shinzen Broke Through an Addiction"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/how-shinzen-dealt-with-travel-dramas/","text":"So. Apropos of sharing my stories in my practice, so you sort of got the impression that I was fairly majorly. Bummed out by my travel fiasco. So how did I deal with it? Practice Wise. Well. One thing is the obvious when when things would come up, I did use the focus turned Tech. I tend to use that when I'm. Upset. For the obvious reasons inevitably the self returns right so. There's 2 freedoms from the self well there's a lot of freedoms from self. Many faceted. Many many ways actually but the 2:00 that I like to mostly think about is well there's the experience of. Quote all rest the non arising of seeing hearing feeling that actually happens. Much more frequently than People realize one of the reasons that by give you these categories. Is so that you can start to notice that effect you already are in mind at least microscopically? Because if you really pay close attention to the inner activation system. You'll see that there are all rest moments and that's a relative no self experience. It may not be clear, an intense enough to cause a stream entry or permanent change, but that is a relative moment of no cell. Now, if you happen to catch an intense arising of all 3:00 at the very beginning and you completely quantum eyes, it and you catch the moment when all three vanish and subjective space itself collapses to go then actually you will have a stream entry experience. That's why Sasaki well, she seems like he's very mean because. He describes how the self arises and passes. And then he makes damn sure that that's going to happen for you. Bye. Saying things about you in public and you know, there's no censoring and there's no. Mercy in that regard. Um because he's just playing a numbers game. Hoping. If he's got enough students here in America. And does makes People intensely self conscious in front all their friends enough times, someone's going to have what it takes. To have to actually keep the practice going while that's happening rather than get into the he said she said, You know FU so anyway. So one form of Freedom is well it doesn't arise and you actually notice that. Um. Another form of this also is. Part of the coin system that uses so 1st. It's like OK, when you see the flower. How do you become free from yourself? He wants see out without any see in here in Florida at all? And he wants to see out it's even itself to be flown ago. But then the next question is going to be or not the next but another one somewhere down the line is OK. Good you wonderful you achieve oneness with flower now? How do you separate from flow so you're smiling 'cause actually had this column? How do you separate from flower? What does that mean? How does it mean make an object out of the flower were not in the normal sense because the goal is to not need to do that. But what it means is. That. The judging self does arise. However, it arises as. A nun fixated flow. It is completely equalized so that even though it is a self. Asthana rising it is not a self as a thing. And so you've returned to yourself, but it's not really the self so my. Language in for this is so well, I'll tell you another story the. Ah. I was privileged many years ago to live in the same vihar out the same. Tera Vaada Buddhist monastery as an and the Maitreya on the Maitreya was sort of the Sasaki Roshi of terrabona booties of in some ways, he was the Grand Old man was in his 90s. From Sri Lanka and. I remember seeing him so much younger person in a BBC documentary. Called the longest journey it's a documentary when they went around the world and interviewed spiritual leaders. And they interviewed him and they said well could you summarize in a few sentances Buddhism? And you said Well, you can actually summarize it in a few words. No self no problem. You might have heard that OK as far as I know he's the person that originative that. However, I have my little console my version of that. Which so no self no problem? Yeah, the non arising of the self? No problem. But also No self no problem. Flow self no problem. You follow the self realized perhaps with a vengeance, perhaps firing on all three cylinders. See you in your own field. But. It's a flow so it is a self. It. And flow and filled the room with its doing. It's a room sized personality, which is the diametric opposite of a room sized ego. So yeah, I sort of used focus in. I'm yeah, little bit uh sort of process. But I also did something else. Which was more in the line of nurture positive cognition? Uh a certain entertaining of certain thought pattern. Um. I think in psychology this is sometimes referred to as an explanatory mechanism. It's like OK. Do do happened now? How do you think about you think about this like OK this do to always happens to me or the world is? Appeared of do, do or why am I attracting this do to myself or well do, do happens. I am I right side psychology. I think someone, saying yes that there's the term explanatory style or explanatory mechanisms like? How do you use talkspace to deal with stuff? Um so. What I use is pro teacher summit product? But it's actually it's only very minorly and talk space actually. Not surprisingly incident unit space and I've noticed over the years that this sort of image based cognitive re framing. Uh is coming easier and easier and easier, more and more naturally. And I think it has something to do with the whole sensitizing within the visual field that I described to you then is such a major element in my practice. So. What I think is I'm putting it into words but as I say I'm more see it then think it in words. But it's like OK well. Yeah, it's in words too. That's true now that I'm saying it, it's like. OK, I've been doing this stuff for 40 years. And. I always make retreat sometime because I believe that the early and if there is a problem. You know, then they get me there at least by the next day. And then I'm thinking OK well. There's really been a deterioration in the hole. Travel experience. There's The tension in the airport around the security and I'm going to make your flight and and then a lot of the flights get cancelled and. So. What's Weather behind this. OK, why, why is their business deterioration well responding many factors. Oh, and I'm not exactly an economist or very sadly in the political field. But what comes up to my mind is well this is at least partially a consequence of 911. An then. I ask myself what was behind nine one. Well. Lots of stuff. Part of it is. US policies in the Middle East. And what's behind that you all know I love Israel OK. I go there whenever but Well, this is I don't talk about this stuff OK because it's not my area of expertise. I know what it means to know a subject really well. And one of the great things about knowing a subject really well and by the way the subject is sensory reality. One of the great things most People don't have something that they know really well like. As well as anyone in the world. But I'll tell you one of the great things about that is, it leads to a huge sense of humility. Because you know what it means to know something really well. And when I think about all the other things that I would like to Pontific 8:00 AM. Like relative to knowing something really well like what do I know about politics and economics of national policies and how stuff should be run by governments? Come. You know, I know I can imagine what it would be like to really know that, well but like forget about it. I mean, not even remotely so that could lead to assert. Refreshing humility to realize that that sort of Militates against the tendency to just want to Pontific 8. On every topic you know it comes up like I see People. In my health club doing about politics. Oh my God, after the election. It was bloody if you were rooting for the other guy, you were hurting and there aren't many people in Vermont that were rooting for the other guy. So anyway, so let's not go there as far as but the fact is that. And what's behind that. Well, the Holocaust and what's behind that. Well, the way Germany was treated after World War One. Which was very abusive? I mean, if you look at the history? Of. Oh my God, senior moment. What's the? Star Trek now, what was right after World War One verse. I yeah, if you look at what happened in for side. If you look at the memoirs of some of those People. They knew that they had sown the seeds for a little more, they just knew it, but they couldn't help doing it. They just couldn't stop it because they? Oh, they just wanted to beat up Germany get even. So. And what's behind that well all this **** in the 19th century in Europe. You know what the French did when they invaded Germany OK. Wasn't pretty? Etc etc, etc and you get this sense that there's no one to blame and everyone's to play. It just I just put that behind behind behind. And that means what? But the world sucks that's not how I remember I said that in this causality, but it also means connection. So the so the inconvenience that I go to go through and when I have to travel now. That's my direct direct. Touching of all of the above. And it's part of. The vastness of my true being. And that's that.","title":"How Shinzen Dealt with Travel Dramas"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/how-to-change-your-life-with-mindful-awareness-shinzen-young/","text":"Recently I've been coming to think of practice in terms of. Uh. The distinction between formal practice. And what I call life practice or practice in life. So. Each. Formal practice what characterizes formal practices that period of formal practice lasts at least 10 minutes. So there's certain duration aspect and all your attention is going into maintaining the technique that makes it formal practice. There are 2 basic kinds of formal practice practice in stillness where you're not moving much. And practice in motion where you are moving you could be walking. It would be exercising and so forth. So. I would encourage a person who wants to be successful with this path. To do a little bit a minimum of formal practice in stillness and former practice in motion each day? What's a minimum 10 minutes. Now that's minimum you might not that might sound like not very much, but You'd be surprised how much resistance of person might have to do in that it's not a time thing. Anybody has 10 minutes here 10 minutes, there to do formal practice is not a time thing, then what is it well. You might say that. The. Ordinary coping mechanism. The normal coping mechanism that People have for dealing with life could be characterized as tighten up and turn away. Um. The new copy mechanism of this practice is the diametric opposite of that it's open up and turned towards. Now you can think of the old coping mechanism. As sort of being like. Uh. How you been getting air? It's sort of works OK. But not really so if you. Start to challenge that coping mechanism. By forcing yourself to have periods of open up and turned towards. At some point, it might seem. To your conditioning that you're like? Being asphyxiated. You gotta get a breath the breath of air in this case, the breath of air is a hit of unconsciousness, the the practice is it's like. Oxygen is being taken away OK your former source of nutrition is being taken away. You're starving to death flailing and the only way to get nurtured or to get oxygen is to start to go completely unconscious again for long periods of time and formal practice won't allow you to go completely unconscious for long periods of time. So it seems like you're starving to death or you're being asphyxiate did an that resistance then comes up and it's not a time thing it's this other mechanism. So what to do in that case well recycle the reaction get interested in deconstructing the resistance. So, in terms of formal practice 10 minutes. Yep, stillness 10 minutes of motion, most days. Practice in life. I've been dividing into what I call micro hits and then background practice so micro head is short. And it's happening during ordinary life. And you could at the end of the day. You can say exactly how many of them you did. How long they lasted and when they took place. And that's a way of tracking the extent to which you are stopping on a dime starting on a dime. So. Stop on a dime means that you suspend your investment. With the content of in and out. You suspend your investment with the pull of past and future. Um. And you a stab Lish an investment 30 seconds here 3 minutes there. With maintaining a technique. What technique could be any tech? So you you what's it. Take me name a technique? Here it OK here in was the first one. Get rest. Your *** is not going to be much here in I'm doing the technique OK after a while there might be some hear it. But I was just showing I could start out and I we go a little broader see how gone Feelin gone. Feel rest feel rest see rest. See out gone Seattle gone field in gone. See rest Seaflow C4 OK. No hesitation. No well, I'm going to sit here and count my breath for 10 minutes and then I'm going to be settled enough to know what's going on? Now that is not starting on a dime 10 minutes. Even 10 seconds. 10 seconds is too long. It's be. Between the stimulus. And the response there is a gap and it's not long couple seconds maybe. And after that, the terrorists are in the cockpit on English emotional hijack Amygdala Big della hijack so we need to train ourselves to stop on a dime start on that stop on a dime doesn't necessarily mean that you stop moving around. It means that you instantly instantaneously suspend involvement with the content. Of in and out. And you are involved with the technique, but it doesn't have to be long be while you're. Walking around even talking to People and so forth so that's the micro hit can be any technique you want. The. The the places where you attend to do micro hits during the day are dead times when you're waiting in line or you're in a meeting an? Get this vacuous conversations going on that you don't really eat all your CPU look like you're paying attention. So it's sort of like the dead times the dead times become the Magic times. You're waiting for your system to reboot OK. I had this idea wants to create a Dharma virus that. It would cause cause people's computers to suspend operation and children had done 30 seconds until they have it on a Mac. It's called the beach ball of death. The beach ball of death, having a hard time net for me is mine. Yeah, right so that's these are those those sort of dead times, then then there's The Times just before and just after what you think is going to be a stressful event. You can have a stress rehearsal dress rehearsal is stressful it's light. I have one student that. Basically, his entire life is telephone calls. And it's And most of the calls are. Telling. Very passionate and powerful People. No. And so these are sometimes difficult calls to make. So he's he can use focus in at autumn focus in 30 seconds OK. You just prepares himself. Watch is the resistance, you know it's. Oh my God, I'm calling so and so and I'm telling them. News they don't want to hear and then he could just make the call and if there's any after whatever another 30 seconds clears it ready to move on. So before and after stressful things micro heads. Now the beauty of the concept of Micro hit is you can check in on your own practice. In a very tangible way there's no BS OK because. How many did you do? When did you do them Watt was the technique for? How long did they last? That will tell you how many times during the day you are. Ah. You are. Severing. The Trammels. Of time. Um. OK then. What do I mean by background practice or having a background technique going well? Lot of People report something like this, it's like well, I don't go completely unconscious, but I'm not. Put in a lot of intention in having a technique going. But it's sort of going in the background, while I'm going about life activities. Um. And some People are able to have that going much of the day. It's not sharp. It's not there's no mental labels or anything. Or maybe not. Much of that, but it's sort of going in the background as opposed to. Just the way I used to be where I would just completely be lossed and unconscious and driven and so forth so. That kind of thing may or may not come naturally to you if it does it's just something to know about it's a component of practice? If it doesn't come naturally for you. That's OK, but the one thing. Everyone can do because it's so well defined and so crisp is the micro heads like I say OK if you're serious about this practice, you're going to have. A half dozen or so micro heads every day and the. The. Less you feel like stopping on a dime. The more powerful doing so is going to be when you least want to stop on a dime. When you're most caught up in the bondage of past and future inside and outside. Is when it's going to be most powerful to stop on a dime? You can use spoken labels to ensure quality. Because it's not going to be quantity right. It's going to be short if your life situation allows for it. For me. Often these stop on a dime feels like I'm gonna die. It feels like. I'm being marched off to the firing squad or something. And that's good that means I'm doing it right. That means I really am going toe to toe with the forces. Of the something this of self in world. So. That gives you potentially 4 elements. Formal practice practice in life formal practice. You have stillness motion practice in life. You have micro hits background practice. And with regards to the formal practice for practicing stillness to accelerators trigger practice and duration training. For practice emotion, the challenge sequence it's all described in. Great detail in the reading we sent you. If you line up these elements if you at least occasionally do the accelerators push the envelope of the length of a sit at least occasionally. Under the parameters described. Uh. But I usually explore. Systematically triggering hot and cold buttons. Uh. Try to do not just practice in stillness and not just walking meditation, but You know can I do focus in while I'm washing the dishes? OK, how deep can I get with focus in while I'm washing the dishes? Focus out on the way to Work etc, etc. So you give yourself the motion challenge sequence at least occasionally so those would be. The Ducks that you would want to line up for day-to-day practice. If you line up those Ducks. For day-to-day practice. What else is left well? At least once a year do. But the equivalent of one week retreat that's absolute minimum. When I see the equivalent. Not everyone in the world can get away for 7 days or 10 days to do a residential retreat. In fact, most People can't. But there are ways of doing the equivalent for one thing. The whole practice program, which we created, which almost anyone can do as long as you speak English. And you have. Can get cheap long distance or you have Internet with Skype? Then you can have a retreat practice you just have to. Sort of amortize it over the years spread it out, but 4 hour or 8 hour program. If you did enough several of those many of those over a year. That sort of will serve as your retreat practice during retreats as you see you build up a certain momentum. Then you go back to your daily regimen and instead of that being a peak experience. In it may go down a bit, but it becomes a stable plateau. You now grow gradually with your daily elements and then do your next retreat as you look over the big picture of the years and decades of practice what you'll see is as a general trend. The retreats takes you to a new level, the daily practice backs it up with more. Modest growth, And so you have this sort of stepwise growth curve. And if you look at the overall envelope of the curve. At some point, it becomes evident that it is in fact exponential. Um. When when does the break point in this exponential curve come the breakpoint means when it goes from looking modest and linear 2. Oh my God. This is really taking off. That's the point at which the derivative starts to going infinite, but break break point occurs. When? You start to get. But they are immediate taste of purification. As soon as you bring equanimity to an experience. You don't have to wait. You just bring the equanimity to it, and you sense that. Sources of unhappiness are breaking up you can actually taste it happening. I can't put it into words OK, so he should deresse I made up a word. A word in Sanskrit. This word should exist in Sanford. Should be means verification or uh? Some Instax there's a taste? Oh, it and it's impossible to put into words. But once the spiritual pallet matures, so that you can taste it. That's the breakpoint because now you're dealing with operant conditioning skinnerian conditioning, so positive feedback loop that's just classic math the. The taste of purification. It can't be put into words, but as I say. Its acquisition marks the transition to a mature spiritual palette. Oh. Their tastes, the kids just don't understand. Why would anyone drink coffee most kids can't understand spicy foods either I think it's like what? Why do adults but this in their mouth? It's bitter it hurts you know there's not a taste call spice? You know what spices. Spices pure pain. It's it's the raw it's the raw nerves. It's the actual same nerves that give you a pain signal are what are stimulated by capsaicin? In fact that's a way of inducing lab pain, but anyway, that's so the. Uh. Why would anybody like something? That hurts in their mouth? Why would anybody like anything that's bitter. Most kids cannot understand why adults? Eat this kind of stuff. But the pallet changes. So there's a taste that comes about when a person experiences. Pleasure or pain with equanimity and and the taste is identical doesn't matter whether it's with physical pain, emotional pain, physical pleasure or emotional pleasure. There's us annoying that because of the way I'm greeting this in this moment. The poison and pain from previous moments is being wiped away and every moment of the future will be marginally. Less suffering and more fulfilling it's A kind of knowing of that when that reward flavored the taste of purification. Which is just the taste of equanimity or the effect of equanimity? When that comes on that's when the growth curve goes like this because now? Now the preoccupation with. Feeling good. Is starting to go away? Here you've got another kind of feel good? That's That's not. The old kind of feel good OK. It's just it's own thing and it's available on demand, so either you feel good intrinsically or you don't feel good and you have equanimity and you feel good. So now you just just takes off. That's when the goes like that, so if you can get this elements in place. Uh then. Uh. You'll be in good shape. The day-to-day rhythm. Formal practice practice in life stillness motion. Micro hits background practice accelerators at least occasionally. You have that day today. You have retreats if you're fortunate enough to do residential retreats great. But some intensive form of practice that's more than just up along set. What else do you need well at least occasionally touch base with someone who is competent to guide the big picture of your practice? That's a very specific job you can you can have many teachers. Um. But you need to have at least one person. That. Knows how to guide People through the entire range of classical experiences that this practice is meant it. Can potentially potentially bring about? So you touch base with that person once twice a year to talk about the big picture of your practice.","title":"How to Change Your Life with Mindful Awareness ~Shinzen Young"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/how-to-do-healthy-merging/","text":"If you do a healthy merging or someone. It's not just good for you, it's good for them. And they won't feel they won't feel. Invaded in anyway. And that's a That's a skill that's a skill of being able to do the merging and not make it look like you're invading them. Somehow, yeah, sure I have to practice that. So when you when you help help healthy merge with someone. They shouldn't feel like they're being in some somehow invaded. They should feel like there be loved unconditionally and everyone wants that. Um, which goes to the equanimity peace. The healthy merging. Is? Uh. Is a state of unconditional positive regard towards that person? So. This is a question that comes up because People get to a certain depth with their practice and they start to experience. This merging I had this come up just a few days ago or someone. Uh. And then there noticing that People are sort of like pulling away from them or something. Because it's like their focus is too intent an the Chinese have this expression. Uh. How can I translate it? Want to chat. Oh yeah, OK. Tone down the light and share the dust. It means like don't share the dust, it means. Don't blow ordinary humans away by. Looking to like you belong to the nonhuman round, too much. It's a skill. Well, I know, People tell me that you're supposed to share. You know your innermost experience that students love that constant. I don't know if I buy that OK because do you really want that much information about your teachers? There is such a thing as TMI? So right here, I'm going to take a chance now I got your attention. OK, this is true OK. Not a day goes by. As that sometime bopping around in the world just interacting with People. I will have this impish thought. I'm passing for one of them. They don't know they think I'm a regular. North American human and of course, most of me is. But but there's apartments Mount that's not human. Uh. Ann. It's like they don't know basically deceived by the surface. And it's sort of fun like someone I don't know getting away with passing for something that they're not back in the days when there was racism pulling the wool over their eyes anyway. Maybe that made no sense at all but you have to pass as a human. One after after you've learned to contact a little bit of what is not human? So you have to express that in a way that doesn't. Weird People out and it takes some training take some training so the. Uh. So what characterizes that the reason I laughed when you said. Why do we merge is the real question is not? Why do reverse the real? Question is like? Don't we all merge? What happened that got in the way of what was originally there. At birth. That's all there was we were. We were everything. And then I can remember when the self arose within me as a separate. I don't have very good memory of childhood. Of specific events. But boy, I absolutely remember. When my Personhood. A rose. Um than it was at an early age and it's like. What something's changed? Something's changed. I used I used to just be happy, all the time for no reason. And now I'm worrying and. It was the arising of talk space. Before that, it's like. There were many issues like why am I not happy anymore. Why am I constantly thinking about the past and the future? I was like I didn't know what was happening to me and I couldn't stop it. So the question is not why do we merge it's like? What happened that prevented us well? What happened was we? Accumulated enough life experience that. We developed a thinking mind, which is good, but it became a prison instantly. Which is not so fit and then later on in life? We are now all making the great escape? What is practice? Is it's the great escape from that from that, so anyway to characterize the healthy versus unhealthy emerging? Up. What characterizes the healthy merging is you understand the mechanism why it happens? Uh. You. Have control over it. You when you do it, it doesn't weird People out. And it you carry away just 112 taste as I mentioned the taste. After I've merged. I got bigger and I got cleaner and that's it. You don't carry away usually anything specific from the merging unless you decide that you want to do that. Unless I say in my long career. I mean, it was only a couple years into meditation, maybe a year into practice when I started to get some of that sense of inside and outside emerging OK that was uh. Long long time ago and in this whole career. I've only twice intentionally merge for purpose tonight. Told you about those 2 were. By the way you folks may get a chance to merge with a mathematician. Speaking math in front of you that you don't understand. Maybe tonight preparing us sacred geometry, PowerPoint will see how that goes but anyway, so you just carry away and expanded identity and more elastic identity for having done. Uhm you don't typically carry away something. Um. So that you. It really doesn't make that much difference if you merge with a flower or garbage can or if you merge with us in Aurora St. People are like really afraid I don't want to merge with the Psycho path. I'm going to you know now you won't pick up any psychopathology you just. Incorporate that activity so. Uh the Unhealthy merging. Is? It doesn't have those characteristics. You don't understand the mechanism you. Carry away something other than empowerment, an purification and in fact, typically what you carry away is disempowerment. Uh. Identification with the aggressor order line personality issues that kind of stuff. Uh. Up. So. Healthy separation. Is? The well, I guess there's a psychological form of healthy separation. But then there's like making the distinctions that are useful and empowering. Meaning see here Feelin out restless wait OK. Those those kinds of separate separating the sensory elements. Those are those are empowering distinctions as a useful discrimination. Um. Disempowering distinction. Is where a lot of People live? Which is that fundamental sense that inside and outside are separated is a boundary of my existence starts with my skin and it's I versus it? Which then leads to US versus them. I call that unhealthy separation. So anyway that's what I have to say about that.","title":"How to do Healthy Merging"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/how-to-guide-someone-through-the-death-process-using-mindfulness-shinzen-young/","text":"Danca. Hubiera credo. Careful where the talk, too sick. Every morning No car never. Hubiera would I have. Credo believed Guess where that it would turn out to be. Tom do say. So sweet. Everybody here to die. Heard that quote probably not. Who said it someone you probably never heard of but? It's worthy to be remembered his name was Francisco swap ads. And if you were living in 16th century Catholic Europe. You would probably know his name. He was one of the most respected philosophers and intellectuals of his time in terms of. Scholastic philosophy in fact, is sometimes referred to as the last of the Scholastic philosophers that whole. Moda philosophy that characterized Europe in the Middle Ages and sort of reached its epitome in the summer theillaud feel Logica of Saint Thomas Aquinas. An Whi Suarez is worthy to be remembered historically is 2 things related. Besides that quote which will go into him at all, he invented the concept of international law. And he was probably the first person in Europe and this is way back right. This is the 1500s early 1600s. The first person in Europe, too. State that tribal peoples who were of course, being completely enslaved and exploited to the Max by Europe at that time. Uh to state that tribal People actually had legal rights. That had the that should be honored by the Christian nations, and that it was wrong to exploit attics enslave them. Which is pretty good for a 16th century Spaniard? Considering all things. So that was what he had to say while he was die. No car we had a greater give where about to say who would have ever thought that this was going to be such a good trip. If I were to make it into very colloquial modern English so. Can this happen? Can it be a sweet thing? Potentially. Yes. And I'd like to talk a little bit. How about that? Both in terms of. Uh. How we would make it that way for ourselves? And in terms of how we can help it be that way for others. There is an arse moriendi. Art technique. Of dying. This is they used to have in Europe manuals on this. I've never seen those European Middle Middle Ages manuals. I don't know what's in them, but I know it's in my manual? Uh. And, of course, there is the famous. Pardo touch it. The Tibetan work. Pardo BIRDO means in between. So the there's many in between States and one of them is. One of those many in between states is the in between the state in between death at next reincarnation. And that that view that we have multiple wives and that there's an interval between. Dying and the next birth is. Share by Certainly the Terra cotta world in Buddhism, and very much the ledgeriana world. And in general, Mahama but there is a very conspicuous silence about reincarnation from the world of Zen Masters and they they don't seem to make much of this, which I find so they are very adamant. This is in general, OK, there are exceptions. But as a general rule. Um. Yeah, it's it's The Zen Masters tend to be. Pretty adamant about what they want you to. Believe I find their silence on this issue to be quite informative so in any event, but taken as a whole certainly in the Buddhist tradition believes in Reincarnation? So to bet there's this famous manual to means to hear drew needs to be set free so the idea is that these would be things that you would say to People that would set them free while they're going through the dying process. Beginning to enter the The Death Bardo. Uh it's called it usually translated that Tibetan Book of the dead, which was a. The reason I chose that titles because there was a famous work translated. I guess in the night in the 19 century from Egyptian that was somewhat of a similar idea. And that was known as the Egyptian book of the dead so anyway. There are these books and instructions and so forth from different cultures. But my approach is pretty simple actually. Uh. A number of years ago, my mother. Fell, which does happen for People that are in their 90s. And she broke some things and she was in the hospital and. They messed up on her treatment with her electrolytes. And it it cause them to. Uh. Think that or it produced a situation where she was going to die. And so it's like OK, it's yeah. Later on the mistake was notice tan with just basically just the right salts, potassium and so forth, she didn't knock. But there was a time when. That issue was had to be brought up. It's like OK Are you ready to go mom, etc, etc. So we talked about that. Ann. I'm thinking. Uh. How many? How many people I have guided through the dying process over the years lots? And they thought that comes to my mind is. I know how to do this, it's not going to be any different for her. I'll just guide her through the way that done so many times before with so many People at least in my experience. It's always worked. Um. And so you know, OK do you want me to guide you through this process? And, yes, and so it was just like OK. I know what to do of course. I had my emotions because it's very different. When it's someone that close to you versus a stranger that someone is referred you know over the Phone that I've never met that has asked to be helped in this regard, but still I sort of I know the steps do the procedure. I know what to do. So. Uh. In this regard I think of myself. In the role of death coach. So to speak like as? Sort of Google issues that sounds OK. It is it's a job and it could be a very satisfying job. Um. I look upon it as. Being a reverse midwife. So a midwife doesn't. Create life A midwife understands how nature? Brings. Uh. A baby from a human. From the unborn into the born. And knows how to help nature along in that regard. So a reverse MetLife. Understands how nature it takes People from uh from alive already born and takes them back into the unborn. Understands that process and helps it along that's the conceptual framework that I use. And, of course, there's an intimate link. Between. One's ability to. Guide others through this process and one's ability to go through the process yourself. All. But he was 95, but it's a lot of elements that are now. So inside now it's OK. It's like this is what it is, and it's more like OK. There's this one's funeral and there's this one that's you know sit can this like OK. That's sort of its dominating the scene. Now. What I find helpful for myself? Is 2 things one is sort of philosophical? And I don't you as you know, I don't try to convince people of philosophical positions. I sort of have a philosophy about things. It works for me, I don't make it. Central to what I teach People how to only teach things that I have absolute confidence are correct and practical philosophy. That's sort of speculative things to it, so but I do have a sort of General philosophy, VM things. Which I inherited from Sasaki bushy now part of that philosophy of things I have absolute confidence is correct the part that is used to model sensory experience in terms of expansion and contraction that we can see we can directly experience that in our senses so to me that's not speculative. But Sasaki Roshi takes the expansion contraction thing way beyond a. Description of Sensory experience, he builds an entire philosophical apparatus that he claims is the ground theory of everything. Now I would never voiced on anyone because that's philosophy of that speculation but. I think he could be right OK. To me, there is some evidence but I'm not rock solid sure of it, so I wouldn't ask any person to believe that. So his idea is that? The principles of expansion and contraction behind everything. But you know, comparing how real world really works all aspects thereof. So that And that are. Our basic problem is that? We are 1 sided in general, People or one sided they prefer the expensive side of things and they have an aversion to the contractive side of things, so he says People everyone loves to be expansion means affirmation. It means the principle of life. It's Aeros. Contraction is negation. It's the principle of death. Yes, Thanatos in the Greek. Freud towards the end of his life so there's nothing but. Thanatos and arrows. There's nothing but affirmation and negation life and death. So society, Roshi says the problem is People like being affirmed. But they dislike being negotiated. Found that Lack of balance is what causes are suffering. So. Looking at the world that way year after year after year hearing his talks. Uhm I guess I start to sort of see see things that way. And therefore just philosophically speaking. It makes sense that you can't ask that dying is. As much a part of nature as living things. And the Experience of being nated. Uh. Should be philosophically speaking? OK. Uh it should be as OK as the experiments of being affirmed so you could from this point of view talk about life in terms of success and failure. That's one legit at that point of view or you can. Look up on success praise and so forth as merely the space of yourself. Being expanded. And you can look up on blame and failure and so forth as just impersonal. It's just the space of yourself is being contracted. Um. So this is a sort of conceptual and philosophical framework about things. But as I say I sort of find helpful in making. Uh. The contract if side of the fact that it's sorted downhill OK and more and more. I'm going to be negated physically mentally and so forth. It's sort of this philosophy makes that a little bit more palatable well that's just philosophy. Uh. In terms of practicality. So from a practical point of view. Watt would tend to make one's own dying process and not just you know it's not just deaf OK and it's even not just dying it's the whole decline OK. And you know, there's the decline and then the sort of extreme part of the decline is the dying process. However, longer short that is, and then you know the olds of it of it is like passing out of existence itself. The actual death. So for me. If I think in terms of expansion and contraction, but nature seems to be. 2 sides. In order to be nature. Then, like I say philosophically I find that help. Why I think that Sasaki Roshi might beyond or something in terms of this philosophy? Is because we actually do see? The notion of mutually canceling polarities. The expansion and contraction. They polarize and then they neutralize him to 0, which is the golf. The source. We see the notion of mutually canceling polarities. Is very? Widely present. In. The main tool that scientist use to model the natural world. The main tool that scientists used to model the natural world, is something called the complex number field. You could just think of it as numbers. Uh. Uh. And. I won't go into details it's actually the manual, but the complex number field. Is built on 3 kinds of contrast each of which has a zero point or a neutralization? There's one kind of contrast, which is move forward move move backwards. And that's reflected in the addition subtraction. Operation. And there's another contrast, so we can move backwards. You can forward over you cannot move. And if you move forward that move equally backward. That's the same is not moving so they cancel out. Then there's a spreadsheet out and pull. And then you can just. Not stretch or Cole OK and that is the most of the real multiplicative group within the complex field is that. Contrast of stretching versus sweet. And then the imaginary multiplicative group. Which is like a subgroup within this field is? Turn clockwise or counterclockwise. And it took centuries millenia. For scientists and mathematicians to realize that you needed 3 three different flavors of. Mutually canceling polarities woven together. Through certain distributive laws and so forth, it to a single mathematical structure called the complex number field centuries and centuries to develop that but that is now the Premier tool that is used to model quote reality. And the fact that. That the They are the main mathematics that that is used to model reality is based on mutually canceling polarities gives me some. You know, some basis for thinking that maybe zombie or something. I as I say I know it's useful with regards to study consciousness. That I have no doubt about it, but is this really the ground theory of everything I don't know, but it's reflected in the mouth. And not just in the complex number field. There are numerous other algebraic abstract algebraic systems. Uh. But not all of them but. Many of the most important abstract algebraic systems involve invertible invertible elements is you do it this way. You do the opposite way. I'm going to bring those 2 together, you don't know anything. So because the structure is so widely prevalent in mathematics and because mathematics is what? Modern science uses to model and predict and even in some ways explain the real world, well if one underlines math seems to sort of agree with Sasaki Roshi's grand philosophy well. Maybe is on or something so course when I go to him and tell and things like this. He's completely blase doesn't care. I went out prompts after one of his talks. He gave this talk where he absolutely. Described. On the set theoretic construction of the natural numbers. I mean he described it. That was that was like the most innovative thing that happened in mathematics in the 19th and 20th century was cantorian set theory. That's the basis of new math and captures formulation of the natural numbers. Built on the notion of set. What's a revolution in mathematics? Absolute absolute revolution. And one day in one of his case shows. He described that you describe that of course, he did know that that's what he was describing he was describing consciousness. So I go up to when I say. Inner OCD your talk about web 0, is and what one is and the number 2 is you know, etc. So he was saying 012. He was describing how each moment of consciousness contains the previous moment, OK and give this very detailed thing about expansion contraction come apart come together come apart come together and he started come. They come back together. It's a larger 0. But the way that he described it once virtually isomorphic to sum up the set theoretic formulations. So I go up to when I say you know Rocha. You just described some pretty advanced mathematics. Any goes aaah. So. Sue got shot while so girl so bad with their no comma. Oh is that so, so the mathematicians have seen that far huh. That was the last time I will pay rocheux rediscovered silence now, what kind of ether does he pull this out of thing about math and science. But he knows consciousness. And he knows a very deep view of consciousness, so in his view of consciousness. Call. The there is life and there's death. And there is that which is beyond life and death that which comes about when you completely give yourself to life and completely give yourself to death at the same time so. Being steeped in this philosophy. I find that OK. That's somewhat helpful, so this is just half of nature when I'm going through and. Call it's part of the deal, but then as I say that's philosophy and that's cognitive refraining. Now let's talk practical. Practically how do you die? In a good way, and how do you guide another person to die in a good way? Well, first thing I do if I'm sort of call Donna case. Typically, I get called in either a student is facing death. I've gotten like OK, I've got this terminal diagnosis kind of thing. Or. Yeah, it's an acquaintance of a student? Why do you have a friend who is facing death? And you would like me to work so. The first thing is the first issue is this awkward thing. That's interesting you know between life and death right the awkward intermediate SUV. There's this awkward thing of. To what extent is this person still fighting to survive. Which. Is desirable inapplicable and to what extent? Are they saying well you know OK? It's the end and I'm pretty much allocating my resources to having euthanasia. The original meaning of euthanasia is not mercy, killing is literally in Greek. You thought it was a good experience of die OK so. How do you sort of bring this up because you don't want to say? Like if you remember that that that Simpsons thing where Homer Simpson eats properly prepared fugu. Puffer fish in the sushi place. It's going to die, so they give him a book to read in the book. The name of the book is so you're gonna die. OK, I think you can just in the role of the death coach. I almost liked it going, there and say OK so you're gonna die. You're smoking that would really be cool and besides there's People aren't necessarily ready to say OK. I'm going to dine out. That's what resources are going so the first thing I have to find out is. Have they sort of crossed that threshold where basically they are thinking. This is it an I'm not. We're not doing any Hail Mary heroic things here to try to survive. It's like their mental set is oriented towards the dying process or is it still oriented towards recovery or these something surviving. Longer what happened so the so the way I bring it up is instead of saying so, you're going to die I say. Oh. OK. Sooner or later, everyone's going to die. Right now, the one thing we can say for sure, is that you're in a life threatening situation. And therefore that's going to bring up for you in a very tangible way. The reality of whether it's now or whether it's way in the future. You know sooner or later. We have to face this and I'm going to give you some ideas about how to face it, so that way. I'm not constraining. I'm not consigning them to already bit kind of thing. Ah so that's kind of how I deal with that usually in my situation by the time. I've been called them there pretty much they know they're going to Diane. That's what they're doing, but in those cases where that's not the case. There is a very subtle way of. Getting them to buy into the notion of OK. Let's consider how to die. Arcelor EMT, let's consider that even even though they might not be resigned to their own imminent death. At this time, so there's sort of that. Then. But that's what I do to get so I can get a sense of their on board with the things that not playing died and suggest and so forth, then there's another thing that I learned early on. Which is? Where People do die they tend to get very went out and not be able to talk very much and also very often there medicated so there comes a time when there can't be much back and forth and you know that my whole way of working is real time interactivity. So what do you do well that's sort of cut off So what I do wait before hand is I asked them I'll say you know, there may come a time when you really cannot. Talk much or give me any feedback is it if that, if that happens is it OK. If I give you guidance is even though you're not giving me feedback. If I just speak and say certain things. And they almost always say, Yes, but I do that because I feel that you need an informed consent in this regard that you don't want I don't want to feel like I'm invading someone space specially in the last days of their life. So if they say, Yeah, it's OK, you know, toys again, you can say some things. Then they've they've told me that it's OK and they know what to expect and I don't. I don't have hesitation about doing this at that at that point. So then the next thing that I do is I start. I query I'm looking for certain things, So what? What is the dual same part. Of Elmo rear OK. Well, actually. It's right on the basic mindfulness grid. As People become more. Worn out. By the process. There. Can often be natural tendency to be drawn to restful states? If you look at the body language of dying People OK, it could be very. Or already sort of course, like it's like the yoga corpse lobster kind of thing because it's just just 2 pieces, Austin to want to move at all, even microscopically. You could see it that the body is starting to is wanting to relax. So I can query. If they can relate to the relaxation of the body and it's a way of putting a positive spin on the exhaustion actually. So can can the Arcana may not relate to OK well. You're really exhausted so how about just being like perfectly still and totally relaxing. The body does that work for you. And so I queried that restful state. I also query if there either experiencing or can relate to the possibility that mental talk may somewhat turn off. That could be caused by various causes of course, it may not happen. So there may be a lot of spinning there, but there is a natural tendency for the mental for the sort of Disengage from sound and for the mental talk to turn off I query. I don't say it has to be, but I ask OK is there any of that tendency or can you relate to that notion of here rest. And then you know the classic thing that that is talked about Tibetan Book of the dead that People see this bright light well. Of course, that's just. I'm example of C restaurant or as you look at dying People, you see that their eyes defocus, OK well. That's another cirez or this blackness. You know, People sometimes like there's this darkness coming over me, etc. That's another flavor of C rest. So I query whether they are experiencing or can relate to the rest will states. The answer is yes that's what we start. And often that's about it. That's all it in because it's simple. They find one or a combination of the restful states that they can relate to they can do it and the dying process seems to be pushing them. That way and usually that's where it is I just keep reinforcing the notion of rest when I had the discussion with my mother about time. Uhm I couldn't be at her and say, Hey, I know what's going to happen with the person after their dead and you're going to go to Heaven and whatever you know. But when I could tell her with confidence is what I said, is that? It's natural for the dying process to be secrets of deeper and deeper restful experiences like the ones that you've had when you meditate 'cause. She one of her favorite meditation. Techniques is focus on rest so she was familiar with that. And her exact words were that sounds wonderful, so of course, produced a lot of pleasant feeling prepared her by being her meditation teacher that she could say that sounds wonderful as opposed to. All the other freakouts that People could have when they are facing the app. That sounds wonderful is pretty good. Uh so often that's that's what I do typically that's what it is it's the vessel states. Mom and it's a way of thinking about dying. It's like well. I'm just going deeper and deeper into into rust. It can happen, though, that a couple other themes come up. UH-1 is flow if you look at People as they are dying. I don't know it sounds weird. and I don't know how to put it into words, but you can actually see. That's subtle vibra Tori flow. Let's fill in their consciousness. I don't I know it sounds weird. I'm I don't know how to put into words. But you can actually see it. It's like a scintillating missed. Over their whole. PM. So you can see that that's what's happening that there it's like. There's something this is something Nahs of self and world is like this. Alka seltzer tablet. That's been dropped in this water and is just always fins. So I will sometimes query if they're detecting any flow states. Uh. Either in the Angela Tori, Vibra Tori, or the expensive contracted because when you come into this world you come in born in between expensive contracted flow OK. That's that's also how I guide the birthing process. And when you go out of this world you are you are. Um. You are torn apart. Literally by the forces of expansion contraction, which sounds horrible, but need not be because if you give yourself completely to those forces. To be infinite in the infinitesimal if you allow yourself to be literally. Stretched and literally like blown away and crush crucifixion stretched and nailed. If you Don't fight those forces of life and death. Then you become those forces of life and death and you become free from the bondage of life and death. And because you become. Life and death itself. So I'll sometimes query flow. If it's present or not or if they can relate to it. Up. Now the other thing that comes up is gone. OK. There is the micro guns. Of. That you may experience in meditation. And to the extent that you have become intimate with those micro Ganz moment by moment. Send through call. To the extent that Europe, intimate with that. To the extent that you have learned? To associate safety fulfillment. Um. After. Tranquility. With those calls will sensory box. To that extent. The. The gone of your existence. Um. Has a very, very different meaning for you? Because it's just a big version. Of all those. Little Cocks just a big version of that. So the bottom line for meditators is. To the extent that you have become intimate with the restful states to that extent. There is a very high public probability that you're dying process will be that natural to the extent that you become intimate with flow. And. Particularly well any of the flavors of flow, including the expansion contraction flavors. There is a pretty good probability that you're dying experience. Um will be informed by that. To the extent to which? You've come to really know. Gollum. As it is. To that extent. You. Woot actually. How? Notice the difference. Between being alive being dead. There's a figure ground reversal that takes place at the beginning of your practice. You don't detect many vanishings at all. Then, as things progress that theme. Often becomes prompt. They talk about the stage where there's you're aware over rising passing rising in passing. So wells up here subsides also appears subsides. Wells up using science bells up here. Subsides rising passing would I am. Yeah, who die means means going up via means going away. When you put them together and probably becomes good. I'll file it's a stage described in the classic manuals from SE Asia. What tends to lead to that experience of rising passing knowledge of dia Badia Yama Dustin I guess is the actual phrasing, politie the knowledge of. Rising falling let tends to lead to that clear experience of rising falling. Is your equanimity your up your ability to completely open to each new arising to just just say yes? That ability at the at the at the very inception of. A sensory veldt, too like a fur totally affirm. The more you affirm. Quickly. Are given sensor you found? The more you will get this rising passing thing. So that's how quick and how complete the saying of Yes is. To the arising of a given event that will allow you to see. The pattern up yes. No yes, no, the big yes allows you to see the no, the passing. But then the next stage after who dia pia. Is described as you're only aware of the passing but actually not quite what it actually says is? No sooner is it arising but it's already messing. And so. That's a spatial that is a temporal description. Uh. In my beginning is my end. E Coker, a poem by TS Eliot begins that way in my beginning as my app. No sooner does a sensory that I thought an external sound body sensation. Arise but you're already aware it's dying. As it surprising it's coming up with style. And the dying away is very significant. Now. In the classic. Manuals of Pteropod Buddhism, which is where the mindful assert be possible that we do comes from. They use this temporal metaphor as soon as it's arising it's already passing. What Sasaki Roshi's done is he's taken that stage of practice? But it gives it a special app. Because. Every sensor event exists and 3 dimensional space, it has whiffed at the night even mental Talk has some space shower into it. Certainly the body of visual sound right left and so forth. So. Temporally speaking. That stage of insight. You could be described as no sinners and rising it's already passing. But spatial speak. The exact same thing could be described this way. No sooner is it expanding but it's already contract. So Sasaki Roshi's discovery of expansion contraction. Is merely a spatial reworking of the temporal description that exists in Terra model literature? He says. Adamantly, there's no such thing as flat Zen. Zen is a ball you must become a ball signed simultaneously expands and contracts In other words, I'm not here observing rising and passing over here. Me and the world are arising and passing in this 3 dimensional fountain that is simultaneously gushing and gathering always. It's a fountain of pure doing so that's that's a spatially of talking about the same thing. That gets us away from the notion of a fixated meditator observing things. The observer him or herself. Horizons in between. The spread, it collapse of space. So. Sometimes People say a shift and you've got a label from the moment of vanishing gone. What's wrong? Why don't you have the label for the moment of arising? I do. I absolutely have a label for the moment of arising. That we use. Ann. When we do the expense in contraction flow. The moment of a rising at a very deep deep level of understanding the moment of arising is the moment when the space of that experience simultaneously comes into existence end begins coming out of going out of existence. While label for that is both both expansion and contraction. They've pulled apart and they are molding. The present moment both. Of Call of call of car you sum up all those posts and gods. And you have a giant eternal fountain of youth. That is always simultaneously spreading and collapsing at pervaded with the absolute tranquility of a trillion vanishings. To the extent that you have become that that there's been a figure ground reversal. That instead of thinking about that or observing that you actually participate in that well. That's an eternal fountain of youth so to that extent. You become that and Your personal death. Is much less of an issue? Because. Writing personal death mean the death of a mind and body. But to the extent that you've re identified with the flow of the source. That's not going to go away. So quote you will never go to that extent. And to the extent that there's been a figure ground reversal. And instead of observing bomb. Um. There's just called? And. Things come and go from it. Well to that extent, you won't actually notice the difference between being alive and being dead. And as strange as that sounds. That means that you won't have to die. Your body mind will have to pass away, but you won't have to die.","title":"How to Guide Someone through the Death Process using Mindfulness ~ SHINZEN YOUNG"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/how-we-evolve-integrate-including-the-dark-night/","text":"Yesterday I told the story of when I was at mom poo poo Jeep. And uh a friend introduced me to the poet Gary Snyder and we became buddies and then later in a presentation here in the United States at a University someone asked him who can save the world and he gave a typical then answer. He set up well. I can't tell you who that person is but I can tell you something about that person. It's going to be someone who doesn't need to save the world. And it's sort of left it at that so. What? What did he mean by that someone who doesn't need to save the world? Let me see if I can fill in some of the details because it's actually very deep. Issue. Uh. This path Contemplative based Psycho spiritual growth. Is how I think of this path it's universal? You find it all over the planet EW? Prehistoric historic times. Um there's an underlying commonality. Which if you think about it is utterly extraordinary considering the enormous variation in culture language race and so forth that is this planet east-west ancient modern. Um prehistoric actually when I say ancient Stone Age our remote ancestors. So there is this. Very human thing. This universal human thing that I call contemplative based Psycho spiritual growth. Uh. It represents a radical reengineering of our humanity. So. I mean, I like to present things as you know sort of in a light humorous way, and the reason is because this is actually such a heavy duty. Industrial strength process. So it's nice to be light and humorous about it and not take ourselves, too seriously, but actually it is. Uh. Very heavy duty. It my phrase is it represents a fundamental reengineering of. Who we are? And I'm going to guess that it's the next step in evolution. Although obviously no one could know that. But if you look at how evolution has preceded hitherto. It's through natural selection at a biological level. And we are the beneficiaries of that process. Eventually, that process. It took millions and millions of years, but that process produced. An amazingly intelligent species on this planet at least relative relative to the intelligence of the previous species. Now, Yes. We there's other Intel, it quite intelligent. Species elephants porpoises. Other great apes and so forth. But when you look at our brains, there's just an amazing difference. Add a physical level, so we're smart. Um. And I think that. Were smart enough? To figure out that there's a couple little flaws in our engineering. The other species have to just wait for the Darwinian timescale. Which is mega years millions of years for natural selection or certainly 10s of thousands of years for natural selection to mold through expansion and contraction life and death. Um mold their evolution. But. Apparently, an once again this is conjectural on my part, but apparently natural selection has finally produced a species. Smart enough to actually realize that there are there are flaws? Um. The entire Uh. European tradition at least post Pagan Europe, the Christian tradition is based on that paradigm and whether or not one accepts the story. the Greek word for story being Mithos Muthos. OK, whether or not you except the myth or the story. You cannot argue with the logic. That there's something wrong. Um lookout at the world something's not quite right. Now. Now you can say. And we will say that there is a primordial okayness also. But on the surface, there's some problems, which sort of makes sense when you think about it because. Very complex creatures like us can develop problems our own strengths become our weaknesses. We have these incredibly advanced this incredibly advanced immune system to defend us. But then what happens. It creates commonly creates an inflammatory response that kills us inflammation is our defense is sort of overworking overreacting septic shock can do you in so there's something a little off in the engineering we? We're real smart, so we have real big heads, which is sort of nice but Unfortunately there now, too big to come out of the mother. Conveniently so the birthing process is very, very difficult for our species. Uh it's an engineering flaw well, we sort of took care of that with modern up Strat Obstetrix and so forth. Um. Uh. We benefit from bipedalism, we could walk upright. But we get a lot of lower back problems. So it's great, but Darwin is not perfect. We have this intelligence, but Unfortunately moment by moment before the rational brain gets activated another part of the brain called the limbic system, the amygdala the nucleus accumbens. Um and other emotional structures. They got activated first so that. Are. Rationality. Is? Neural anatomically colored by emotion ality so we have the situation of having this advanced primate brain and in the center of it is essentially the worldview of a Komodo Dragon, and if you ever seen any videos about Komodo Dragons. Their society is not a kind one. So. There's some possible problem here. In the neuroscience field there have been numerous image. Ng studies watching people's brains react to politicians. And it absolutely does not matter what your politics are. When you listen to the other. Your emotional brain lights up and your rational brain just shuts down its expansion and contraction. So. Not surprising huh? What happens given that that sort of power engineer. Um. So. Good news is where smart enough to figure this all out. I just said were smart enough to figure it out and were smart enough to. Correct it. And the way that that has been done hitherto. Is certainly a lot faster than Darwin? But maybe not as fast as we would like because you probably noticed it takes years, and decades. Typically, although we get benefits right away. Otherwise, People would never come back after the first retreat. We do get benefits right away. But those of you that have hung in for the duration know that. In general, God saves the best for last really, really mind boggling dramatic changes. Tint to happen after a lifetime of practice what well happiness independent of conditions which is pretty awesome. So that's still that's pretty quick. So it's a radical reengineering and. Who knows? What's the next few centuries will bring maybe, as we partner with science will be able to accelerate things. By an order of magnitude I've got a friend at Google. Some of you probably read his books. Jetman Don Tom TN's bank to his friends sets up that's the weird. Chaozhou dialect of Chinese, Singaporean Chinese. I call him. Chun his last name is Chung in Mandarin Chani, Ming, it's really cool name actually. It comes out jet man in his dialect, but E mean in Mandarin, it means means like. 1. One voice 1 voice that shakes the world. It's from Buddhism. It's a Buddhist term anyway because he's a Google engineer. He started this search inside yourself thing. Some of you are probably aware of so his thing is 10X stream entry. Timex stream entry is a traditional terravita term for initial enlightenment, and 10X means he wants. To engineer it so it's 10 times quicker for all humans and we have 10 times as many of them well. Maybe we'll have 1000 or a million times as many of them? Who knows can't say about the future but. Um. It is a radical reengineering of who we are. Um. So who are we well from an engineer's point of view were. An input output system are we have sensory input, we have behavioral output. The sensory input reflects object if conditions. The behavioral output. Impacts object if conditions. Um and in between we have inner and outer sensory experience, I like to classify it in terms of. Inner and outer see, hear feel with the inner see, hear feel creating the course sense of associated with the core sense of Iamus. So. Part of the Reengineering the radical reengineering I talked about yesterday. The on the sensory side, the ability to have complete experience. Um. Allows us to Experience discomfort. With less and less suffering. And it allows us to experience pleasure with more and more fulfillment. Um. So. That. Uh. That has An impact on. Our behavior. The. Normally. Behavior is Driven. By suffering. And. Frustration. So suffering is physical and or emotional pain. That is not experienced fully. Um so. Sensorially that causes suffering. And in terms of what we do say, and think in the world are behavior. It causes a drivenness in the behavior. Flip side. Um. When pleasure fails to deliver the full. Potential for fulfillment. It turns into what might be described as frustration or craving same thing. The experience of a craving in the moment is just an experience of an incomplete pleasure. You may have heard the notion that the impurities are pure what the hell does that mean well actually means something very, very deep and important it's not just an enigmatic thing that someone said in order to blow your mind or get your attention. When you have a craving. For some pleasure. You have you could have a mental image of the pleasure. You could have some mental talk that says. Hey, I want this? But you actually get a little taste. A memory of the physical pleasure and more importantly, emotional pleasures. Rosiness in the chest. A little hint of smile on the face a free soul of excitement going up your back. Very very subtle pleasure is present in that moment of. In the sensory experience of desire. If you are able to complete that pleasure. Then it won't that pleasure the pleasure that is part of the sensory gestalt of the moment of desire. Then that pleasure will give you complete fulfillment the pleasure in the desire will fulfill the desire. If that doesn't happen, then the desire becomes a desire that drives sensory experience because you're not satisfied yet. Um that was pretty subtle and complex but. Driven behavior need. Uh is associated with physical and or emotional discomfort that has turned into suffering and or. Physical and or emotional pleasure. That was too subtle to complete was so subtle that you couldn't experience it fully enough to fulfill you right then and there. And now we're driven. Um so there is need. Half of the radical reengineering. Of this process. Is? Sensorially the reduction of suffering in the elevation of fulfillment. But that is linked behaviourally too. The reengineering of. Driven behavior into what for lack of. A any official word I might call motivated or dynamic behavior. Uhm I think it's very important that. The result of our practice, not not make us in different too. Conditions conditions in our own individual life community nation world. Um. So, in order for that to happen. We actually have to take measures to make sure that not only do we have the experience not only is our experience one of reduced suffering an elevated fulfillment? But our behavior. Moves is re engineered evolves. From driven. Um to dynamic. So what characterizes dynamic behavior is. Uhm it is motivated. Bye. Pain. And fulfillment. It is not driven by suffering and frustration. Um. As we evolve? We go from. The something iness of self and world. To a kind of doing this. Um. Of space. However, that. That. Rick wires. Acclimatisation. Um. Some People As they get. There, as emptiness or no self or nothing nuts, whatever you want to call it. As that becomes Evidente. Some People actually many People probably most People. Um. Immediately love it and it is functional. In most cases, what are my teachers are used to say? Ah. A couple drops of emptiness are the best Medison in the world they cures a gazillions diseases, however. It is not necessarily the case that for everyone. Um. Contacting emptiness or no self or nothingness. Is immediately? A source of safety fulfillment love and appropriate behavior. Some for some People. Um. You have to sort of cultivate a taste for it. There's some work required to integrate it. Um. So so that it, it is a source of fulfillment. Safety. Love inappropriate behavior. Um. For some People. Um. They have to go through an awkward intermediate zone. Where are they? Sort of varying a flatline situation. Um where in some way it's sort of nice because the old gross suffering an * riffic perennial agitation is gone. But. The old the old bounces also gone and the edge and the motivation and the passion for life. Um seems to have left. I call that the Flatline stage, so some People have no difficulty at all. Integrating emptiness. Just. It's just so obvious. How is? Liberating and functional. Some People have to sort of intentionally train themselves to develop the pallet. The taste for it to appreciate that it is liberating and function. Some People have more of a challenge. You go through this flatline situation and now most People don't have much of a difficulty. Um. Or they require some training but it's not a big deal. Um. Less People have the flat line, but it does happen, I get emails from students. All the time that are in that state. Um. Fortunately, the severe end of that spectrum. So you see I'm I'm presenting to a spectrum of. Um. Relationships to the emptiness or no better word phrase would be a spectrum of. Degree of challenge to integrate emptiness so that it is liberating and motivating so. And there's the real easy end and that's a lot of People and then there's well take some work, and then there's like takes some more work. 'cause you're in that flat line thing and then there's the deep doo-doo end now. Fortunately, that is in my experience quite River. But as more and more People practice. It even though it's a relatively small percentage. You're going to have larger numbers of People have to face that and that's going to be part of the. The shadow side of contemplative based Psycho spiritual growth. Becoming the norm on this planet. It will be a wonderful thing that that happens, but Hey, we have to be honest, we have to address this. This issue. Fortunately, the all of these sort of steps. The spectrum that I'm describing there are affective things you can do to deal with it. Even the really deep and so the deep end. I call Dark Knight, some other People also call it The Dark Knight. Uhm it's similar to a known psychiatric condition called DPDR. Depersonalization derealization disorder. Which happens to non meditators? It just happens to People out of nowhere. The classic report of DPD are is I was sitting in my room and suddenly. It seemed like I was no longer real and the world was flat and cartoonish. Anne had no no reality to it whatsoever. And no matter what I do, I can't get out of this and it's awful. So the disease names the condition. Depersonalization. They've had insight into no self. D realization. The world is no longer real. Disorder and it's a bad trip. If you go to websites of People that have this condition, some of them know. That no self and emptiness are major Buddhist themes. And there's one website where they say, I just don't get it. How can the Buddhists? Say This is the best thing, that ever happened when this is the worst thing that ever happened. Um. Yet. The great majority of People that do Buddhist practice. Um. Do indeed find it to be the best thing that ever happened. So what's the difference? Well, I don't know exactly what's the difference. Someday we'll probably know. But what I can say is several things first of all. You probably notice that the word mindfulness is now used a lot. It's like everywhere, which is a good thing. But. And now that it's everywhere. It's sort of can mean anything. Um and so the meaning of mindfulness gets watered down in sort of Generalized. As it becomes a common term. That's why I'm so adamant to say that what I mean by mindfulness is exactly this. Well. People picked up on the term Dark Knight. Now it's gaining. Currency. And it's getting watered down. And now it's sort of means just. Any difficulty that you might encounter when you meditate People are starting to call that The Dark Knight. Well, I prefer to have mindfulness be a technical term, not a general Hey. Be aware folks and I would prefer The Dark Knight to mean what it meant for Saint John of the cross, which is in the Catholic tradition, which is where this comes from which is when they finally. Or in a 16th century into 16th century, Spanish Catholicism, and you definitely had had some ideas about what God was going to be like and it turns out that it's not quite that way. Um and It takes some getting used to. The fact that. Nothing whatsoever, iness is in fact, Divine. So that difficulty integrating the emptiness of God. Ah. What? Saint John called it the dark night of the soul. You start out and you have to struggle with your. It your sinfulness your selfishness your impurities your. Lack of concentration you struggle with that, he called that the dark night of the senses. That's the beginning of the meditated path. But then if you're really successful you have to deal with the consequences of that. Oh, so he called that the dark night of the soul. So we had a lot of difficulty integrating the nothingness of God, but eventually he did, he was successful. Um. So. That UM. As I'd like The Dark Knight 2. Refer to that specific problem. Rather than just be another word for Hey folks, you know if you meditate you might have to face some gnarly * and you're going to go through your Dark Knight well. Everyone goes through some gnarly just living you go through some gnarly *** doesn't mean you're experiencing depersonalization derealization that you can't get out of and it's a bad trip. OK, all that's a very, very different critter. Now. As I say in my experience. It's relatively rare. So don't think Oh my God. I better not meditate 'cause. I'm sure that's going to happen to me. So there's a spectrum of. Challenge associated with integrating. Uhm the Integrating the emptiness. And integrating it means 2 things that it's sensorially it accrues to and empowerment. And behaviourally. It does not it does not lead to. And indifference. So. How do we make sure that? This radical reengineering is successful, well, I've got a lot of talks about this. But just to give you the executive summary. We're going from. One kind of passionate life to another. Um. The former kind of passionate life was driven by passions in the sense of craving aversion unconsciousness and so forth. The new passionate life. Um. Arises in a different way. And if that happens automatically fine if it doesn't happen automatically then that becomes part of the training to make sure that it does happen. So let's say that some training is required. So. Essentia Lee, From my perspective, you do the same thing. For any any place on that spectrum. The person that needs to do a little bit of effort to integrate devoid. The person that is flat lining Anne needs more effort considerably, and then the rare case of the person who is Essentia Lee paralyzed by the void. Um. What differs is not so much the qualitative intervention qualitative part of the intervention? What differs is the quantitative part? The more difficulty integrating the more more massive the intervention that is required. So it's a matter of amount. But in terms of what you actually do it's pretty much the same thing. So. The common situation would be the common problematic situation is not the PDR. It's the flat line so it's like. How do I? How do I get the old bounce back so? Um. Well. Let me give a bunch of tangibles suggestions. This is something you can know about for your own practice, but it's also something to know about in teaching others. Once again as Mindfulness becomes more prevalent and part of mainstream culture worldwide. It will be important to be clear about these things. So let's say that you've gotten some taste of emptiness. Uhm but there's some challenge in making it integrated. So. First, one thing you can do. Is selectively attempt to what is? Pleasant in the emptiness now you might say Well, the emptiness doesn't have any pleasure well, it's. Technically, true but yet. Can cause pleasant impact on a human? So what could be things that you would train someone to tune into if they were in a flatline situation well. I I'd have them look for certain things for one thing the emptiness may carry a tranquility, with it. And you can train yourself to come. Uh. Appreciate that tranquility. And it may actually take an intentional training. To sort of TuneIn, Oh yeah, it's sort of nice. That I can touch this tranquility on demand. So that's a training it's a development of a pallet of taste for the void. Um what else. Now of course, the tranquility might not be something there aware of this is this is a an algorithm. It's an interactive process that I do. So one thing I ask is OK can you sort of. Enjoy a tranquility associated with the void. I use emptiness void no self. They just they all mean the same thing. Some People might quibble that they're different terms, but it's Essentia Lee, the same continuum at the same critter what else? Well, the emptiness might be associated with the disappearance of a boundary between inside and outside. Uh and that can be. Fulfilling and give you a sense of expanded identity and Connectedness. So I checked for that and if that's available, OK now we're going to selectively attend to that. Instead of attending to worrying about the bleakness of the void. Well let's look at these factors what else? Well, it's possible that the emptiness is associated with. Subtle Vibra Tori, Energi. Um that could be. Perceived as pleasant so you tune into that. Um. If that's available. Oh, OK well, what else. Well. There might be a sense of sort of effortless. Expansion. With the simultaneous contraction. Um. If so could tune into that that may or may not be present. So what else can we do. Um. All of the things I just mentioned. I call accentuating the positive. Then there's illuminating the negative. Um if you if the emptiness causes. Fear. Or. Uh. Irritability or any other sort of confusion if there's any. Or, a disinclination to act. Those are sensory events. So everything is empty so. Why should I bother doing anything at all? Why should I bother doing anything at all? Um is is a thought now isn't it? It's I'm arising in the inner system. Clearly. It is not the case that everything is empty for this individual. Because the perception everything is empty so why do anything? Ain't empty. It's a something for that person. Or the perception. I thought. But the emptiness was going to be nicer than this. I think that's what John of the cross is problem was, he was expecting. the Angels and the try triumph illness. Whatever and instead. He got Nada Nada Where is my People say focus? So. I thought it was going to be better than this, no that's no thought that's not empty so you empty out the reactions to the emptiness. Then there's nothing to get in the way. Of. Responding appropriately to object if circumstances. But now the responses is not driven it just happens and it's powerful and it's magic. Um. And. It's Progressively, more appropriate. Just because you're functioning from emptiness doesn't mean that what you do. Is always appropriate you'll still make mistakes? Or it makes mistakes. But then it learns from those mistakes, just like the self self learned from its mistakes. The baby doesn't just get up and walk. It falls to the right it falls to the left. But at some point, it equilibre eights. And the no self doesn't. Perfectly speak in public. Or respond to each situation. Perfectly, it makes mistakes. It's inappropriate. But then it learns just like the self self learned. And if it doesn't then you become something not very pretty. So don't let that happen, it doesn't learn from its mistakes. You think anything you do that just happens. And there's no ego. Behind it. And so it's OK, no matter what it is even if you're mistreating People now don't think it works that way. Some People think it works that way. But I'm I strongly disagree with that philosophy of practice. Um. OK. So. That's it, you now are more and more. Arising from the situation. So, your object to behavior comes out of objective reality. Um an if it's not right. It alerts you learn whatever remnant of self is there learns the no self learns. To do it right. And to the extent that that happens now you started it become a magic person. That just walks into a situation and magic things happen and it's wonderful for everyone. What else more might be required. Um particularly with respect to making sure that the actions are appropriate. From how human point of view. Uhm you may need to intentionally build certain human habits. And. How you build those positive human habits easy nurture positive? You. Create an activity called an admirable self. By training, admirable human traits. Rational thought. Positive behavior changes of various sorts. Um habitual good feelings towards People and so forth well, you can. Build those by the nurture positive techniques. So you can use things like focus into deconstruct. The resistance to act or the freak out. That is a reaction to the void so you empty out the reactions to the emptiness you empty out the disinclination's to act. And focus in deconstructing the inner see, hear feel. Is a good technique for that and then you reconstruct or strengthen certain positive habits the nurture positive? Um. What else? Uhm well. If the old behavior was passionate in the sense that it was driven by passions. How what's going to provide the bounce for the new behavior well. The situation. All the things I just mentioned plus something else. Uhm you can train your. Motor circuits into a quality of spontaneity. We talked we talked about this and done this now in a number of retreats and we're going to be doing it at the end of this retreat, if you look at the schedule the auto. Uh the Training not of the sense circuits, but of the motor circuits to enjoy their own. Natural just happening nahs. So you can develop a taste. For what? Children experience directly, but don't. Think of as an object because they just it just happens to them, but you know children just like. Stop in the mud because it's just fun to stop in the mud. It just happens OK. There's a just happiness to the way a child stamps in the mud or runs here runs there. Well, an adult even if there. On Alta Cocker like me an old Fogey Crapper, like me can have can still have that child, it's childlike bounce. Because the circuits are still there, it's the nature of our motor circuits to just happen. So you can train yourself to. Speak move and even think from the place of bats. And. That's what literally puts the bounce back in your step and puts the lilt back in your speech. Um that's a huge factor. In. Making sure that. The realization of emptiness does not make you in in expressive. Are. Or indifferent. With regards to. The world. What else? Well. Some People And this can happen as the result of contacting the emptiness, but it can actually happen, it could be something that you contact. Um. The first time you ever meditate. In fact from some People. The thing I'm about to describe is something they've known about their whole life. Not everyone, but some People have this sense that inside of them. Is? A primordial black hole of. Um. Dissatisfaction. That can never be filled. Um. Now I'm stating at one way. People use different language, but there's just this, this void in me that no matter what I try. It's just never filled. And it cannot be filled. Despite that, I keep flailing around in flailing around, hoping to find something that will fill it. So not everyone not all humans have this perception, but I have found this to be a not uncommon perception something along these lines. The trick here is to realize. That yes, indeed nothing will ever fill that hole. However. From another perspective. There is absolutely a way to fill that hole and the way to fill that hole is not to try to do something to fill the hole. But. Not surprisingly, The trick is. To have a complete experience of that whole because that perception that there is this whole inside of me that can never be fulfilled. Is a sensory event? It happens in the inner system. It comes up in life. It may be lurking. All the time in the periphery or sometimes come up strongly now as I say not all human beings have this by any means. But quite a few do the trick is to realize it is an inner sensory event. It comes up in some combination albiate, perhaps suddenly and Nebulously, but it's coming up in the inner system. Now, when something comes up in the inner system. Sometimes you can't quite pin, it down in terms of image talking body motion. But at least you know it is in the inner system. And that gives you a general direction to poor. Clarity and equanimity. Constantly down into that hole. And Guess Wat just like every other sensory event. Um. It eventually evaporates. And problem solved. Now, if you filled filled it, you filled it by annihilating it. And. So once again, the fundamental drivenness has been worked through. So when Gary said the kind of person who can save the world is the person who doesn't need to save the world. What he was implying is a human being who has been. Re engineered. Um. In a radical way. Because he was giving the Zen poetry answer. Um. Uh. He didn't fill in the details. You'll notice that the details took a full hour to describe.","title":"How we Evolve & Integrate (including the 'Dark Night')"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/how-why-shinzen-became-a-monk/","text":"So you were ordained a monk Mount Koya in the Shingon tradition right correct is that something you always wanted to do since you work, it. No, not really what I always wanted to do since I was a kid was be a summer I. I saw in the 50s. Japanese samurai movies. When I was in middle school I just got fascinated with the whole Japanese culture thing. And that led to my learning the Japanese language in la going to Japanese ethnic school. In addition to American public school. And that got me to Japan in my. Senior year at UCLA, where I was an Asian language major and I encountered real life, Buddhist monks. But my interest in them was just because it was the closest thing to ancient Japan that still exists In other words, in the temples honey. They have telephones and electricity and all that, but it's sort of like the old days right so I was fascinated with it that would be the closest that I could get living. Not only the wisdom source right so I was hanging out in Buddhist temples just to sort of live as close as I could fantasy of ancient Japan. But it wasn't meditating because that's the last thing in the world I had a proclivity to do I knew I was scattered and impatient and Wimpy and all those things, so I was just hanging out having fun in the temple. But I had a sense that they knew a kind of secret that they would be. Willing to share but they would never push on me. So what I got back to the United States. I was graduating from UCLA and I thought. Well, I want to go to Graduate School. I want it to be related to Asia. I'll study Buddhism because you need a lot of esoteric languages for that and I was good at languages. And so forth so I wasn't going to become an academician on professional scholar of Buddhism Pass. My prelims for a PhD at the University. Wisconsin so they sent me back to Japan to do research on topic. So I decided to pick the shingle on school of Buddhism, which is the Japanese version of ledgeriana practice. Also on his Tantric Buddhism Esoteric Buddhism. I chose that because, although many Westerners at that time were studying Tibetan forms of Adriana practice. No one knew about or were studying the practice as it had been preserved in Japan for 1000 years, so I thought OK, I'll make this my academic. Bailywick my specialty, I'll be the expert in the Western World on the Japanese version of practice. So I went there with that in mind with that goal. But when I got there, they wouldn't teach me anything because it's. For self transformation, not just as an intellectual curiosity, so they said. The only way that I could learn it if I was willing to become a monk at live in the temple so in order to be able to write my PhD thesis. He became a month to so you could write your pH D base is pretty much. But what happened is that my motivation shifted once I started to live in the temple. And once I started to get some instruction in the practice, I realized there was a huge potential there for me personally, so they were very clever. They put me in this situation that turned me around and then something happened, something happened in my personal life that pretty much blew piaui emotionally. And pointed out to me the absolute necessity of. Seeing beyond the body and the mind and. That happened while I was in that first year that I was a monk there in Japan. And that just changed everything for me when I was in Graduate School at Wiscconsin. My hero was my graduate. Advisors name was Richard Robinson and he was an intellectual giant just an intellectual giant is all I could say he could make puns in 3 languages simultaneously. His specialty was Buddhist logic. Yes, there is something called Buddhist logic. It's Aristotelian Syllogistic logic that was used in the media. Amika School of not guard you're not somewhat along the lines that the Greek Zeno School and so forth use logic to sort of show People beyond the world. Let's let's be out of the world anyway. He was a master of that. And while I was a monk. I got this letter from the United States. He had been injured in a bizarre and horrific accident, he a fuse blew out in his house and he went down to change it. And there was no source of electricity, so light. He struck a match and there have been a gas leak there. He went up like a torch and just burns all over his body and horrifically if he had lived had been. Terrifically deformed. Any just suffered in agony for a month and then died. And I thought I thought to myself, what good is all that knowledge. What good is all that intelligence? If this can happen at anytime to a person. That made it real for me. An camping the motivation to want to see beyond the limited identity with the body and the mind.","title":"How & Why Shinzen Became a Monk"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/how-would-you-describe-enlightenment-answers/","text":"Someone asked me interesting question in one of the on lines about no self and it sort of got me talking and thinking about the topic. There's Uh. I sometimes say that the Buddhists are their own worst PR People does this. I mean that the words that are used to try to sell Buddhism suffering impermanence. Emptiness no self or even more inscrutable and off pudding no soul. Which is sometimes the translation of course there are very, very good reasons why this terminology is used? But at first, it's confusing and off Pudding I mean emptiness. Is that Jewish Buddhist humor thing? I don't know if you've seen on the Internet. All these Jewish Buddhist jokes. And there's one this one, I can't remember exactly I'm paraphrasing but. Uh what's what's them? Well, you, yeah, bust your tush for 40 years, and what do you have to show for it at the end, Bob Cus. So Bob Kiss means am humans beings literally but he's like nothing right. You got nothing to show for it or you have it is so very special nothing. I mean when I started I had no idea what these terms refer to they sounded weird. They sounded interesting. I learned how to say them and a half dozen Asian languages, but it's like I didn't know what they were talking about emptiness well actually sometimes People would say like the void so of course I had this image of this like. Like this gaping thing that's going to suck you in actually there's so Little Italy in the sense of the expansiveness of the formless jhanas that's part of it, but But not at all the whole picture so you know, I would hear about the void and or the emptiness and I try to formulate in my mind, web what it must be? And, of course, it's not just the Buddhists. I talk about things like that. The essentially all the Mystics all around the world have used very similar. Language Ng and the language is counter Intuitive. It's strained something and yet it lines up across cultures, which tends to indicate that there's something universal going on here? Why would they cultures that had no contact. I mean, there are obviously there's sometimes the cultures have contact. There's cultural diffusion but cult I mean? Why should something written in the 6th century in Srilanka. Line up so well with something written in the 16th century in Spain and those worlds had no contact at all but you read Theresa Abele's interior Castle, you read the V City Monka and. There's not perfect, but there's a lot of alignment. Their surprising alignment. Teresa ends up saying in the end took her a lifetime. She went through the Jhanas. When the Christian version of that only at the very end of her karere did she come to this. Transformation in her understanding and you can see that she struggles to convey the difference, which is described all of these. Ever deeper states of recollection tranquility, and so forth and then you could see her struggling to try to describe something that belong to a whole other dementia. She said it was an intellectual vision, but then she said. But I don't mean that I saw a vision of Jesus or something something changed in my mind, and my concept about things and. What changed was to use her words the self forgetting is so profound that it seems as though the soul no longer exists. Well, that's stream entry, the salient defining feature is insight into. But non something miss himself Sukhia Dipti, The view that there is a sub kya a thing an entity called self with him now, you might think that. Writing in the age of the Inquisition in Spain that someone would get in trouble for saying something like that. But she didn't get into trouble at all. In fact, she became the the main map maker for Christian Mystics. It's like OK 'cause. She gave such clear descriptions so it's sort of interesting that these descriptions somewhat lineup and their counter intuitive so emptiness and nothing. This is like across all the traditions. So you know in my mind, I tried to imagine and I mentioned. That there was a period in my. When I am the rest of the United States was doing a lot of LSD. Some of you remember that that time while you're here now, anyway. So I have these ideas about what the void was supposed to be then. and I have ideas now except the ideas now are not based on speculation that based on direct experience. So if I were if I were to say. What the emptiness means to me what comes to my mind 1st? Um. It's two things. A kind of Brown cinas like a basketball that like. Bounces. Um. And the second thing would be a connectivity. A connector that holds the whole universe together and therefore is naturally linked to a sense of love so that's really counter. Intuitive you wouldn't think emptiness would have either this springiness. Or, a sense if connectivity or love. It just doesn't quite compute but that's those are the first things that come to my mind. So. And yet we also I can also understand why they call it vacuity or emptiness or nothingness, etc, etc. So yeah, it's counter Intuitive. I can also tell you that, like an Apple. The first thing that hits your teeth when you bite into an Apple as not necessarily representative of the whole Apple. Unless you peel that you get the skin, which is sort of hard and dry, but most of the Apple is going to be juicy and sweet and the first bite that People take into emptiness, which is a phase that might last. A few hours or a few years when their teeth are just getting beyond the skin that's not. That experience might be sort of bleak and flat and vacuous but. That's that's just getting past the skin. Once you're past that it's this other thing. It's springy connectivity that provides safety fulfillment in a sense of love. Uh so anyway, um. The. But in the on line someone asked me the different flavors of no self an every time I think about that I come up with a different list over the years, so like this came up to me and I thought it was interesting so I thought I would share it with you, but who knows what it will be. You know next month or next year. That's the thing it's you know the story of the elephant. The Blind man. But you may not know that that comes from Buddhism. It's metaphor elephant is Enlightenment and. But People have? Tend to see a certain part of it and so describe it. A well it's like a row or it's like a wall or it's like a pillar or it's like a sharp like a Tusk or it's like a hose well, yeah, all of all of that 'cause There's all these different facets. To it, which is can be confusing. So. It's important not to fixate once view, one of my teachers used to say kill know Satori Wah Ashton. Watching I today's enlightenment is tomorrow's mistake, meaning not error. But rather that your perspective broadens and deepens and changes as time goes on. So when People do come to an experience either slowly and smoothly or suddenly of emptiness himself. What have you one of the first pieces of advice? I give them is don't fix it? However, compelling today's view of it, maybe for you. Don't fixate that it's gotta be that way. And for God sake don't stop studying with competent teachers. 'cause sometimes People go off. They think they're done when they're just beginning actually so. Uh. We have this this. This meeting that takes place every few years, where the so-called Western teachers, which means People teaching Buddhism. Full time in the West. It doesn't have anything to do with your race. It's just where your main activity is is in the Americas in Europe and so forth as opposed to the Homeland of Buddhism, Asia, so there's this western teachers meeting and it's like a professional. Meeting for People that do this full time and so it's interesting and it's for me, I've always enjoyed it. It's it's a lot of fun and it's like a professional meeting and People discuss topics and so forth so. We uh this was a number of years ago we broke up into interest groups. So you got to choose what interest group you're going to be. And so I choose chose the group that was called quote? How do you deal with the issue of enlightenment so that's I thought that sounds interesting. I'll go? I'll go to that group, 'cause I definitely have some ideas. Uh. But it was like. Sort of. Sad because it turns out, it wasn't what I thought it was the topic was not what I thought it's like OK is much teachers are going to get together and. Tell their strategies in their algorithms for the leading People to stream entering. But that's not what it was about. It was about. How do you avoid marginalising students who aren't yet enlightened and still talk about enlightenment? It was like the avatar of everything that's wrong with politically correct. Sorry if that offended someone, but it's like well. We don't want to make People feel bad because they're not enlightened yet. Or whatever, so it's like I don't know that's not what I thought that was gonna be. So let me say what I couldn't say in that meeting. Well, in general. The. Any approach has the potential of showing you know self any approach. So it's not like what is privileged over another and in fact? It. It's not infrequent that no approach shows someone who know self so that People that don't meditate that don't have a practice it just happens. Uh not uncommon. So. In theory, any of the techniques can do the trick or some combination thereof, but if someone were to come to me and actually specifically say. I want to stream entropy well. I would probably start them off on is the focus in technique that entails working with mental images mental talk and body motion. I'm saying that's what I would probably start off with not like. Oh yes, this is the silver bullet. The White Knight. The Magic thing that guarantees dream entry, but it's for me. It's in my algorithm. It's a good place to start. Because it's pretty straightforward up together can do it. And it's likely to bring some sort of insight fairly quickly. So the idea is that? You go to image space and there's either images or there isn't so you now see more rest. Then you go to talk space. Same thing, emotional body same thing that you work with the whole system. So when you're working with the whole system. Uh. Different things can happen, one of the things that can happen is that the system goes offline. Typically, momentarily. Mental screen is blank at his quiet bodies, emotionally neutral. Now. Typically, the reason that happens is that something in the outer system. Sort of expands in intensity. A physical sensation or a sound there's a lot of famous than stories. Along these lines. You know, someone's enlightened by by hearing a pebbled you know strike. The broom or the teacher shouts or one of my favourites when you take a bath in the said Temple. You in Japan and bathe in these in something that looks like this except it's like huge and it's a pot actually. It's heated from the bottom they take off all your clothes and there's a statue of. Uh. Bar and watch a who's the patron of the of the bathing area and you have to bow down like this, or whatever. 'cause, he was and are hot and the way he got enlightenment was taking a bath OK like OK. I'm back and do it, so typically. External site external sound body and our physical body sensation sort of impinges suddenly an if you're monitoring the intersystem. Instead of getting pulled into that you notice that as that expands the inner system goes into a state of relative rest. Now that can happen to People at an early part of their practice and that's already. It's not like the alignment or anything, but there are already getting a sort of insight as to how this system works. Now. There there's another version of that. That's more dramatic and if that happens and you have a clear experience that might. Change things on a more permanent basis instead of the inner system going into a relative state of rest, meaning see rest here. Rest feel rested or where your screen is blank. You're losing the quiet in your head and bought bodies emotionally neutral instead of that you're aware that the inner space itself. Just an issues. There is no image space there is no talk space there is no emotion body space. That's absolute rest in the inner system. It's like the relative rest that a beginner can have only more so. So wanna flavor of no self even a beginner can experience it's like. For a moment there's relative rest, baby because there's a strong activation on the outside the inner system gets relatively restful. Then there's a much more impactful. Restful state that's an absolute rest cessation of the space of self itself, so there's 2 flavors of no self right there. What else well does that mean that in order to experience no self the inner system has to turn off? No, not necessarily. The inner system can be quite active. But. It's not tangled. And not coagulate eed. If the inner system activates even strongly but all the strands are clearly separate. They're not crisscrossing in an unconscious way. And if there's little or no freezing or coagulations in that system. It will be active, but it's A kind of flow self. And that is yet another flavor of no self. It's tricky, though to truly untangle that inner system. Because the tangling is at many scales simultaneously. My metaphor would be if let's say you have 3 kinds of strands red, green and blue. The problem is, they exist at many, many diameters there is like. You know. Please when is 3 inch thick and one inch thick and a 10th of an inch thick and you know a half a centimeter and Millimeter, an even submillimeter is all for each one of the 3:00. A colours there's all these different scales. And now they're all. Intertwined so inside red is subtle blue and inside that is sutler green, etc, etc. And then maybe even sutler read again? So to fully untangle that scape takes a little bit of practice. But if you can sufficiently untangle it and if you can. Let go of the tendency to tighten around its arising and passing Oh my God, did it. Take me years. To not resist the arising of self? 'Cause I thought well the goal of this practice is called no self so if I'm aware of itself. I'm a failure with the practice and that creates all sorts of tension took a long time to get out of that. Bad rookie habit so anyway. The soul of the inner system activates perhaps even strongly perhaps even in a very negative way. But. There's it's untangle Denon Blood, then creative another flavor of self self of no self. Rather, it's a Freedom because of? Intensity of clarity. It's an untangling effect it's an anti emergent quality turns out that. One of the requisites for the something miss of self is that there be a kind of tangling of things, so the Sukhia * depends on lack of clarity. In fact, you probably know that there's a. Traditional metaphor that's very famous in the Buddhist world, the amount name Nagasena. Uh. Converted from a non native Adjule and he passed it on to King Melinda also known as Kingman and rose, so Melinda is what he was known in as in in Poly, but his Greek name was Monandrous. He was he was a Greek King up. Yeah, about 2000 years ago in the western part of India. Remnant from Alexanders invasions of India and so he's a Westerner on, he had this dialogue with the Buddhist monk. Nagasena and it's recorded in Poly literatures fascinating and we know that this monandrous was a real person because he's recorded in western Greek history also and in the western accounts. It is said that he died very peacefully. So maybe it's true that he did actually become Buddhist meditator in any event. The The Conversation has been preserved. It's called Milinda Panha, the questions of King Melinda Orman Andros, so nagasena. Our gives the metaphor of a chariot and he says he goes all the different parts of the chariot. Ann says you know is the cherry at the wheels is the cherry at the body is it cherry at the axle tree is a chariot. This that and the King has to admit no none of those parts are at and. Then he says, well and it's the same for self and then he goes through the 5:00 aggregates or something like that. I can't remember exactly these. He sort of breaks cell foot into its components and tries to show the King that there is nothing inside called itself, so that's a famous metaphor. I. And my own version, which I think is more to the point and Neuroanatomic Lee. Uh. And most of you heard this, but I'll just go for it quickly so the other old fashion CRT. TV screen. And monitor and your and there's white on the screen. It's a color monitor, but it shows white on the screen. Can I say to you there? Is no quality of white on the screen? When you say are you not just look at it. It's white and I say well. Here's a magnifying glass and we agree that this does nothing but. Make things a little bigger and resolve resolve means things that fall together to the naked eye are separated by the lens. You can look this up if you want to know what the resolution. Powers resolution power doesn't change what's out there? It just means that things that are tangled get untangled. And I say OK so now we're going to approach this white screen with this magnifying glass, which we agreed does nothing but make things look larger and resolve. In other words, untangle the sensory components and what's going to happen as we approach. The impression white will go away, and depression, Red Green Blue Little pixels bullet rise and that's what was always there, so an emergent quality. This is a metaphor just like Naga singing out Buger us. Sister budget as metaphor. This is a metaphor that probably is a little closer to the actual underlying neuroscience of the thing. Although it's probably not identical, but I think it's closer than the traditional one. There's an emergent property in perception. That requieres a tangling. Of the sensory components and as they get untangled that emergent quality disappears. In the case of the white on the screen, the emerging quality is the impression of whiteness. In the case of self the emergent quality is the impression it's a think. So as you look more and more carefully. I like to do it in her see, hear feel, but we could do the 5:00 scanned as we could do. The four elements. We could do the four foundations of mindfulness. There's a lot of ways that you can. Parse horse. That pie the important thing is not so much. What categories you use but the magic of? Um the dimensional analysis. I like the inner see, hear feel because it satisfies Occam's razor. It's the simplest one that I know of you can look up the 5:00 aggregates or 5 scan does on wika. Pedia an see if you can imagine meditating based on the definitions you see, there 'cause it's pretty inscrutable. But anyway, So that's why I like to use this other thing it's similar and it's immediately observable. You have to be a very, very advanced meditator to be able to observe the song Scar's for example, no beginner can. Can observe that but any beginner could observe enter see hear feel so? So that that's another flavor of no stuff that's the no self that just comes from untangling. Up the system. Uh. Are there other? Flavors of know Sophia. Um. If there's enough unblocking if there's enough D coagulations? The inner system arises as sort of like. Uh. A lot of vibrating bubbles. It's like effervescent bubbles. It's all flow. And if you get that where the intersystem sort of is mostly like just shivering on your screen, and stirring and talk space and kind of undercurrent of activity and the emotional body that may not have any particular flavor to it, but it's like the emotional circuits are set up idling down there if you get this fluid experience of the inner system. That's another whole other flavor of no self. What I like to do when that happens is cover inner space because you may not be able to parse? The see, hear feel very clearly when it goes into that subtle level of Vibra. Tori flow, but what you can do is cover the whole space and then just let your awareness soak into it and the more you soak into it. The more vibrant. The space becomes OK well. That's a whole. Other flavor of no self, which is sort of like the? The flow self. Um. So some of these flavors of no self are available to beginning meditators. Some of them not so much that the disappearance of inner space. That's a little bit on the advance side. And there's also an advanced version of the flow self. Um. If the if the system becomes client enough. Each time there is an inner activation. That means each time there's a reaction to the outer world each time. There's memory plan. Fantasy 8 each time there's a judgment or a conviction aura confusion that arises in the inner system each time. There's an awareness. That that was. Fermented into existence by. Simultaneous expansion and contraction. Now, when that starts to happen. The ordinary self all these ordinary things, including your confusions and your desires. And your judgments. There never disconnected from. The sorts. Because they arise in the folds of expansion and contraction. An but sort of the 2 sides of God if you want to sort of get. Use the G word some People don't like that word. But I I like it, then if you don't then you something else expansion and contraction so expansion and contraction. They touch. Each ordinary part of. And Uhm. On the other hand. They touch that collapse of space thing also because that's where they come from. The. Expansion plus and minus pull apart expansion and contraction polarize. Uh. And then they neutralize when they neutralize the space of experience goes away. And when that happens with the inner space. That's absolute rest and then that absolute rest breaks apart into the absolute flow of simultaneous expansion and contraction. So it's an extraordinary thing when your ordinary experience of self is in. Is embraced? On the inside and outside by the spiritual source. Uh. And then There's no reason why that doesn't also extend out to the outer see, hear feel. So actually when someone gets in light of the world gets enlightened as a famous Zedd story to that effect. This person struggled for years and years and years to as amount to get enlightenment. It didn't workout and he was living at this on this mountain called those on. And finally gave up and went to the Master and the master told him something. I don't remember the exact story. But it's OK. If you have to leave the temple. You know, we have to leave but but something I've sorry. I forgot what the something was. But as he's going down the mountain whatever that something was it had planted the seed. And he Suddenly had this realization after all these years of. Struggling and confusion and he blurted out the words that just came out of his mouth were. The mountain has become in light, not I became enlightened. So what does that mean? Um. It just means that the external see, hear feel. Or is born in the folds of the same polarization of the source that's all. Um. So traditionally when it happens to the. Intersystem we call it. Moogan Japanese means no self and when it happens to everything in turn out are. It's called cooler emptiness, but the the really just the same thing. So uhm. These are a few ways to think tangibly. Uh about No self and at least a couple of those would be something you can understand that even beginner can pursue with practice.","title":"How Would You Describe Enlightenment answers"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/in-the-hands-of-the-cosmic-pizza-chef/","text":"So what did you say? You said that. There's like this thing. That, it only wants one thing it's like monotonic. It knows nothing it's a force and it's a command and it's one command only. B. And it doesn't respect any normal distinctions. We make Either normal ones that humans make or the ones that we make when we construct the techniques. Like OK, we're going to distinguish visual auditory semantic Internet or active restful OK. This doesn't respect any boundaries. All it says is We can say it a million ways live. Get big. Be everything is not bad? And there is the. There is its complement. It's exactly the same except it says exactly the opposite says die. It says get small says below. And up no sooner is one present than the other his press. That's what you. You you made a certain spatial metaphor of like OK. You know you put brushing from this side is pulling up from the other side that particular physics metaphor might not be. The right metaphor, but it's the right general idea. Are they generate each other? Up. Ah. A man feels more masculine in the presence of a woman in converse with. Generate. But their own can't. So. You're absolutely correct. There. Eric maybe They represent complementary flavors of. Nutrition. And we're like babies. And we want to be sometimes. We want to be held by Daddy. Sometimes we want to be helped by Mommy sometimes we want to be held by both. Sometimes we wanted just crawl off on. But as long as we can know that we can. Have look all of those on demand. We already exercise. So this is the adult version of South. Of perfect parenting. To say. Uh. The adult is now the infant write an? Mommy and Daddy are perfect parents from their perspective. Now from the babies perspective well that's another story because most of the babies. Aren't even aware? They've never lost their cosmic, Mommy dead. So the sense that they kind of want to tear you apart. Like a kid who? Doesn't understand like? Why do I need to eat? I'm crying? I'm suffering? Why you kind of feed me that sort of like like strange well. It is absolutely the case that expansion and contraction will tear you apart. Um. It's like being in the hands of the cosmic pizza chef. Is being stretched and pounded? Hall and in the process the lumps get work done. And. It. It does feel like your being torn up hard. All. But then as you get used to it, it feels like. Instead, the paradigm shifts from. Please the forces of life and death are tearing me apart. 2. I am giving myself back to Watt, I'm giving back what I got from father. I'm giving that back to 5. I'm giving back what I got from mother to mother. And the The. And. So it's Donna. But it's what you originally got from them. It's everything inside of you that. Says Yes, Joins. The cosmic yes. And everything inside of me that says no joins the cosmic now. And. That's that's the yes and then Oh that's big enough to mold this, or any conceivable universe. And then you become that. You become that. For a moment or a longer duration, depending on practice, etc, etc. So at first you think that these forces are tearing it apart. Um. I guess we could say there are 2 basic phobias right. Claustrophobia and adorable it's too small an it's too big. 4. Humankind to bear. Um. But then when we get over that phobia. The paradigm shifts from father and mother, a tearing me apart too. I'm giving myself back to father and mother, too. I am participating in the activity of father and mother.

Obviously from doing this practice for as long as you've been doing it your functioning in a different way. An I remember you telling me of how they hooked you up one time to get your brain studied. Maybe it was University of Arizona someplace and the technician came into you instead now don't start meditating yet until we turn on the equipment and use as if I could stop and you use the analogy of saying it's as if you asked someone with a lot of muscles to just don't have muscles for a minute, so much a part of how you function. I would like you to give. Me us a taste of what it's like inside your brain and any given day as best you can just in terms of your processing are you. I know you've talked about meditating in the visual field or I would just give me a taste. How you process your experience and what's deliberate? Applying a technique in which just happens if I were to. Give the big picture of what my days are like. I would say that typically on any given day. My experience ranges from. Scattered and unconscious. In a sense as though I had never meditated. I'm choosing my words carefully in a sense as though I've never did never meditated. It ranges from that to direct contact with the spiritual source involving literally seeing through this world. As I'm bopping around within it, which is also an experience of myself and world arising from and returning to the source. Um. So my experience ranges between. Something like A person that has never meditated. And something like absolute oneness with absolute fulfillment. And it ranges. Between those and the main feature what the impact of the 40 years of practice is is I don't have much preference between those 2 states. Someone wants astero, she in my presents what the definition of Enlightenment is. And he said, Soto little subtly deny to know Kupets, who got Knockroon Arico to Daschle, which in Japanese means I guess you could say Enlightenment is the passing away of the distinction between an alignment and non alignment. That was that rather that was my 0 she very famous Roshi in Los Angelus as many students all over the world great students that are doing great work. So anyway, there's not a it, ranges from completely deluded to quasi enlightened without a preference. Between those and that's what's just naturally rising that's not within applied effort of any like that's correct if there's an applied effort, then obviously it starts to valence towards. That state of of energy and emptiness. But the main feature daily Life Is there's not a preference, which is in stark contrast. When I began. When I practice and probably in stark contrast to just about wherever you want begins because when you begin you want something you want to fit your getting somewhere. You want certain experiences. So my early years of practice where preoccupied with comparing Maps and finding every possible experience in every description. And then needing to have all of those experiences and wanting to have this or that happened, which is what I think a lot of People when you gotta start somewhere. So that's sort of natural so I could see the biggest change that has taken place is that I don't have that big a preference between Enlightenment and non enlightenment. That's sort of the big picture. Then if I'm intending to meditate what in action in in life. As I'm like I'm talking to you now OK, so if I'm going to be intentionally meditating now. I just started to intentionally meditate us. We're talking an typically meditate in the visual external visual field and I typically a meditating on the process of simultaneous expansion and contraction, causing the world in front of me to arise. The men disappeared so that I'm now applying a formal technique. I'm arising and disappearing revising and disappearing from the source moment by moment. Therefore you appear to me to be the source and therefore very effortlessly lovable. I'll take it but. No more available in the flower next to you, or the garbage can outside. So that would be in and now if I'm doing formal practice where I'm seated and my eyes are closed. I will do any of the five ways that I teach I use all my own my own techniques. Just sort of depending on interest opportunity and necessity, although recently I've been tending to default to the technique that I call do nothing. But do nothing technique that's what I've been using recently for my own formal practice. Do you find that subversion of focus on rest in terms of it 5 way formulation that I use when you were talking about everything dissolving into having no preference. You could in a sense defined could you set it. I now have no preference for enlightenment or not enlightenment, but is enlightenment. Then this process of having no preference that's a stage where In other words. 1st when you start enlightenment is a figure and the world is a ground you in the world are the ground and you have this fantasy of enlightenment. That's a failure at some point. There's a shift of figure ground reversal and you and your world are the figure. And the actual experience of Enlightenment is the ground. And you may may go through many years and in fact, decades of preferring to be in that state. But then that tends to pass away with time. And if you want to know what I'm preoccupied with I am preoccupied just like anybody like somebody wakes up and they're preoccupied with money or their health or sex or drugs or whatever. I'm preoccupied. There's something I default to as a sort of obsession. If you understand that someone in quotes but it would be my version of being obsessed. What obsession is in my consciousness. The obsession is? Can I figure out better ways to bring masses of People? To what I experience. That's what I default to like. How smart can I be? How creative can I be? In the service of the world. Not a bad default.","title":"Inside Shinzen's Brain"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/interactive-guided-meditation/","text":"So as far as I know you have developed a form of teaching that I've never known of before. Interactive method guided meditation where instead of telling someone what to do to meditate or describing it to a group while they meditate you one on one interactively work with someone and talk to them, while their meditating with them talking back to you. Can you tell me how you came up with this? First, let me say of course, that's not the only way that I I do those other things, too. You know groups right now, so forth, but very well. But what I really love is the one on one work, which can be done face to face in person, but also works very well over the telephone which is enormously convenient because People that study. With me give them my telephone number and they could call me when they are in. Crisis or when they just need to tune up and so forth so we can work over the Phone also that way. So I can do it face to face or I can do it over the telephone with someone. How it developed was that? I have my own center in Los Angeles, many years ago and we had residents and they would sit. We would say as a group early in the morning and then they would go off and do their jobs and then we come back and we'd sit together in the evenings, So what I would do is during the morning sets is I would give them interviews. And that's very standard. You go into a teacher and you sort of talk about in practice, but typically. The interviews that are done last for 10 minutes, something like that, you get a chance to ask some questions. We sought to touch base and so forth. So when I started I was doing those kinds of standard interviews and I don't know quite how it occured to me, but it's just sort of gradually dawned on me well wait a minute. You know what's the metaphor for meditation teacher well. There's a lot of possible metaphors. The described himself as a physician. You know there's a disease called suffering and I have an intervention that is sufficient to cure for that. So. I thought well what's the metaphor for me. I'm a coach. So what is a coach do? Well, if you go to the YMCA. You ask a staff member to show you how to use the equipment and then they stand by you and they make sure you're using the equipment properly and they have good form and they give you some encouragement so they answer your questions and they sort of check in with you. So I thought well Gee. That's a natural way to go about this so I started to say OK. Do this. And then I would just sit with them and do my own meditation and then so 10 minutes later, OK, when you did that what happened. And they would say, Well, this happened, or that happened, and then I would say OK. It means this, or I think you should modify it just a little bit, it might help and so forth, then we sit for a few more minutes. We do that, and I started to notice it was really working. Because when you First learn how to Meditate. If you're working with them in the mindfulness tradition, you're really wearing 2 hats. On one hand, you're the meditator. On the other hand, you're trying to observe yourself and that's very tricky is very hard to do that until you internalize the skill. So if somebody interactively got it, you. You can let go of the head of being the meditator. You're just following you just follow their guidance and you could stay with your experience so as time went on, I started to develop a more and more elaborate decision tree. Until it became this incredibly powerful algorithm that just loops and branches until the person has a breakthrough experience and works with a high degree of reliability. And so it's a combination of. You not having to wear the 2:00 hats. Plus, the sort of presence of an experienced teacher as a sort of contact. I kind of impact. Plus, the sharing of a lot of expert knowledge because I know the windows of opportunity that nature presents literally minute to minute nature is constantly presenting people with windows to transcendence People don't know how to recognize them. When I'm working interactively with somebody. I spot when a window is open and I point them in that direction. And it just works like a charm and that's where it's really like a designer meditation because when someone does a guided meditation you still handing over the wheels someone else is still driving on that. But what this does is it no to guidance is I think I've been guided privately in meditation over the years with you. I don't know how many times dozens and dozens and it's never been the same way twice. So you know, I think of it kind of is a designer meditation in that moment. Using those opportunities. Yes, that's the general idea. The trick is not so much knowing how to answer your questions. The trick is for me to know what are the important questions that's what's taken all the years? To find out what are the important things to look for as a person meditates so I'm looking. I know what the right questions are the most significant ones. The questions for you to ask good questions that I ask you as you're meditating right? That's been the challenge and then define optimal answers for each one of those questions so if I asked you 10 questions that are absolutely fundamental. Uh. And let's say each one has 2 possible answers. That means after 10 questions. I have found the one out of 1000 guidance is that is optimal for you. If I ask you 20 questions, which could easily happen in an hour period of practice. I have found the one out of one million guidances. It is optimal for you so it's like having a tape library with a million tapes and a wizard that decides for you? What is optimal for you by asking you the right questions. So yeah, you better fix even wizard bed? It works that's why it works. Well, that plus the other things we talked about.","title":"INTERACTIVE Guided Meditation"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/is-fixation-the-necessary-cause-for-suffering/","text":"You'll recall our conversation about necessary causes. I find this very interesting because. As I mentioned. App. 1 layer of necessary cause going to have a deeper layer of necessary cause underneath it, OK that may or may not be evident until we investigate. So. Sasaki Roshi. Who as we speak? Is 104 years old. The oldest Living Zen Buddhist master and still as a complete functional teaching load at that age. He talks about a necessary cause for suffering also it's clearly related to Tom ha. But it's not the same word. He doesn't use that very all that that uh there is a word in Japanese that means Tom Hotshoe Jocko. But I hardly ever heard him talk about. Shoe Jocko. Instead, he says. G ko or quartesolo quota, Liaros Goodnight, meaning it is not a good thing to fixate itself. He talks about fixation. As a necessary cause of suffering all you have to do is Unlearn. The habit of fixation and you can pass all the koans and you will be enlightened and happy So what I find interesting in this formulation is that he uses. Are related but different word? Suddenly, but significantly different word for the necessary cause for suffering and then the connotation. It has positive well it has a very different I mean, if you say. Craving it has a certain reverberation if you say fixation even though it's? Related it has another reverberation in the reverberation of fixation as well. That's starting to sound like a global physical parameter in the information processing circuitry of the nervous system global physical parameters. I got it. Yeah, examples of global physical parameters in nature would be viscosity. In a hydro dynamic system. Or. Resistance or impedance in an electrical system. OK resistance in a blue to talk about a Potters wheel having friction wasn't that one of the. I don't I seem to vaguely remember a metaphor like that. But I don't remember the specifics well if it has fiction versus when it moves smoothly. We're going to have to look that up that sounds extremely interesting. If you will find that form that might be wow. We should definitely look that that's a homework assignment so. And actually friction in a mechanical system so if something analogous to. Electrical resistance or hydro dynamic dynamic viscosity or friction and so forth if something analogous to that is also a necessary cause for suffering then that sort of makes us think well. That's starting to sound more like talking about. The brain and the nervous system. OK, whereas craving is somewhat. I mean, sure we know there are centers, etc. Etc were connected to a sense of self. That's craving versus fixation that something is happening in the system that's sort of like something that either happens in nature, things freeze. They Mount OK, So what is particularly interesting is if we think about a parameter like? What's called the Reynolds number analysis? A characteristic of flows flow systems, OK, though there's a way of computing a parameter, which characterizes the flow. Regiment flow regime, so I won't go into the details. Obviously, but if you have a flowfield annetts. Reynolds number exceeds a certain value, then it goes turbulent. But if it doesn't isn't in that at that level. It's smooth and Lamb and are. So. If. Suffering were analogous to turbulence in the flow of the senses. I'm not saying it is OK, but let's say it were. Then we could model and if If. Not if none if non turbulence, OK were. Or if the turbulence was dependent on some sort of parameter that we could identify with the physical functioning of the nervous system for example. There's something called the attentional blink, which I won't go into the details but it basically measures how much fixation. There is in your moment by moment concentration and that can be measured. Now, with science by the movement of the IE mean or you mean you take the. It's a blink metaphorically not physically that's why I said, I'm not going to go into details. There's a lot to say about it, you can look it up on the Internet. But Essentia Lee, It's something that can be measured now with reaction times. And it's physical it's not subjective, it can be object. Ivli measured and it's thought to correlate with the degree to which one is inappropriately holding on to things. Really, yes, wow and therefore. But there's a judgment their appropriate inappropriate well. No there's not and that's why I'm not going to go into the whole basically well I guess I have to now. Let's say that you're given a sequence of a sensor events and your job is to track the sensory events. Uh. If you inappropriately hold on to a previous event, you're going to blink or miss theorizing of the next event. Oh yeah, So what they found is in meditators. There's less of that seeming to indicate and that's more presents well related to sensory clarity, but it's also related to the equanimity of not inappropriately holding so we're already be getting to get some. And this is completely object if it doesn't require any self report because it's either sought are you did I mean, it. I mean that's a self report but it's not really because they presented an either quicker. You don't. It's not like well. Yeah, I remembered that I'm going to tell you OK. So it's very object. If in what it's measuring now. I'm not saying that that correlate Stew? What Sasaki Roshi calls fixation. But it's already beginning to be a glow it doesn't matter what you're attending to this phenomenon could be in any of the senses. It's already beginning to look at possibly another necessary cause for suffering if something like the attentional blink is related to what Sasaki Roshi calls fixation and then you can untrained that or Maybe cause an intervention that prevents it OK of some sort. I don't know waht OK, but let's say it's possible to do that. Now we're talking about eliminate ING. Other kinds of necessary causes for suffering or let's just say that we take the early Buddhist want an ha. So. When you have time uh you can't have all you gotta do experience. Nirvana is get away. Get rid of. Don ha In other words. All you gotta do is knock that card and the House of Cards that is the suffering falls. Well let's say that what the printer called Tanha is actually on the second tier of that House of Cards. Let's say that at a deeper tear there's something that has to happen physiologically in your nervous system for ton hot to arise. Hypothetically that it's not unreasonable. So if And that means any and all time high and not just craving for cocaine or shopping. But any and all let's say there is a necessary cause. Behind the necessary cause. And the necessary cause that is behind a necessary cause is completely neural physiological in nature. Then there could be interventions that directly address that and our physiological, so you knockout you knockout the physiological. Necessary condition for Tom ha. Therefore, you knockout Tom Ha therefore you knockout. What blocks perfection? So theoretically are potentially any piece of research into craving. If it were done very deeply might unlock. A key physiological mechanism. What I find interesting is that you can get you can't get much funding for research on enlightenment? But you can get funding for research on drug addiction. That's funny and But if research on drug addition were were too. Go very, very deep and very, very broad. It's possible that the necessary cause for ton heart could be found. And eliminate it. Which would mean if we take the Buddhist model that? There would be a physiological and don't ask me what time 'cause I don't know if I did know I get the Nobel Prize? I have no idea is it? Is it some super kind of biofeedback is it. F MRI biofeedback isn't TMS stimulation is it on what they call dreads which it sounds bad, but now it's designer designer drugs for designer receptors. It's like the cutting edge of the cutting edge of neuroscience. Anyway, who knows Watt, but if there were a way to knocked out the necessary cause for the necessary cause that it was purely physiological than Nirvana would actually simply happen now, what I find the delicious notion is that? You can get funding for craving research and you could get funding for deep and broad, craving research and you could get funding from Republicans glad for deep and broad, craving research. Therefore, it could come to pass that Republicans response become responsible for the entire world of becoming Buddhist. There we go. Is good?","title":"Is Fixation 'THE' Necessary Cause for Suffering"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/journey-to-true-spirituality-shinzen-young/","text":"So I just had a session with Diane and if I'm incoherent you can blame her because maybe a little too much into my body, so we'll see how much. Upper chakras are functioning at this point, OK, so we've been talking about. The possibility of mindfulness revolution beta few points. Let's just review. We have some guests tonight coming in medi arrests. So to speak. So I like to think about mindfulness from what might be described as unified POV. Very widely encompassing POV I I think it is possible to have through careful analysis of the dimensions involved, it's possible to. Understand certain underlying commonality's not just for the SE Asian Buddhist practice, which is where. Current mindfulness sort of historically came from, but more broadly. All of Buddhist practice and more broadly. Still, all of contemplative practice all around the world there. Any contemplative practice E or W could be nicely analyzed in terms of the degree to which the way in which. 3 core skills are talked about cultivated an employee applied so the 3 core skills are concentration sensory clarity and equanimity you can. Think about concentration as the ability to focus on what you deem relevant. Um at a given time? What's important about that way of describing concentration is not so much? what I said, but what I didn't say I did not imply that concentration is necessarily limiting the spatial scope of your focus. I did not imply that concentration necessarily was holding just one thing for a long duration. There's concentration could be expensive, it can cover a large domain. Yes, it could be spatially contractive also and those are actually sub dimensions of the concentration skill? How broad or narrow you focus concentration could be momentary. You can make break make break may make break taste momentary high concentration on a variety of objects. But you could also have sort of what People often think about when they hear the word concentration, which is. Holding just one thing in attention for an arbitrary duration of time, like you could hold the sensation at the tip of your nostril for 4 hours without any wavering whatsoever. Now that ability to hold just one thing for an extended duration of time that certainly is a sub dimension of the concentration skill. However, the ability to make break break break break and have? What is called Konica Samadi or momentary high concentration? That's also very important, especially if you want to maintain mindfulness. A deep state of mind from us while you're engaging in daily life. You're driving a car you're having a conversation eventually we want you to experience being very, very deep while you're moving around and to get the MWe maximum meditation mileage out of each moment of. Daily life to Manassas Eyes your life as we were talking about in the group process for that understanding that the dimension of concentration skill? Which is momentary high concentration, but consciously tasted as I say it's technically called Carnicus Ahmadi in the Pali language. So the Speaking of concentration as the ability to attend to what you deem relevant. Not saying it has to be this thing or that thing it has to be your your breath or your body not limiting it by its range and not limiting by saying well it has to be something small could be something large not limited the concept of concentration, too well. It has to be a long duration on just one thing it could be momentary on a variety of sensory targets. As they present themselves so as I say the way I like to talk about concentration. What's important is not just what I say, but what I don't say because there is a tendency to assume that concentration means hold a small thing. Um for a long period of time. And, yes, indeed that represents 2 dimensions of the skill, but there are other facets to it. Concentration is to focus on what you deem relevant sometimes you hear People say, well. I don't want to learn to concentrate because I need to let my attention freely float in order to be creative. And make associations well. If that's what's relevant to the moment, then your ability to do that will be enhanced by concentration concentration will not get in the way of that intuitive flux. In fact, it will enhance it. You'll focus just on the place in consciousness that makes those connections for you, because that's what's relevant to that moment, so concentration power sensory clarity has the second aspect. It has 2 sub dimensions, basically you know, I've talked about it in the group process resolution. The ability to make it to upgrade the R. Discrimination or bandwidth within the sensory circuits themselves. Ah that's the resolution and then detection subtle is significant. The ability to detect subtle sensor events that are normally subliminal is hugely important on this path so concentration power resolution an detection skills. Particularly the ability to detect the very instant when a new sensory event. Horizons and the very instant. When an old sensor event passes because where things come from and where they go to are the same place. And we've talked a little bit about the primordial great perfection well that's what proceeds. And follows each ordinary inner and outer sensory experience, so the ability to detect what happens at the very instant of the arising of any sensory experience. Um the ability to detect what happens as it's passing is the ability to briefly be vectorially directed towards something that is beyond sensory experience, something that is beyond. The embedding of time and space. OK so sensory clarity equanimity originally equanimity as a term from the Latin equal animal literally means a balanced state originally it meant sort of being. Unmoved anone expressive, but that's not at all, what it means as a technical term to describe the dimensions of mindful awareness, not at all. It's balanced in a different sets balanced in the sense of. Not. Pushing an experience that's trying to arise so not suppressing the Arisings. And not inappropriately holding sensory experience that's about to pass so it's. Basically training the sensory circuits. Into a Uh training away their subtle tendencies to interfere with themselves. It's analogous to reducing friction in a mechanical system that's at least the way I think about it so. We. We cultivate these so I said that I like to think of mindful nurse so the mine. Modern mindful movement in my own mind. The phrase that I like to use is that it's. A contemplative based Psycho spiritual growth working in concert with science. So a two way St science will help us understand it in a way that we could never have understood it before. Even the Great Masters of the past didn't know even basic neuroscience. So they could only give a first person report and they did so brilliantly. But with the current ways to objectively think about biophysical basis of experience and so forth. That's going to give us now. An incredible advantage to innovate to understand the deeper levels? What's involved in these psychologically and spiritually. Significant. Growth that humans go through when they do this practice, so working in concert, meaning we looked to science to improve and deepen our understanding of what's going on, but also the mindfulness practice will improve. The scientists as humans and as professionals and so you get a positive feedback loop going that could be very impactful. Or in the next century or so I'm a big picture guys so you know, I look. I look to the type guys. The spirit of the Times toy me? Who is a very famous historian made an extraordinary statement. He said that when all is said, and done. It is possible. It didn't say this would happen, but he said it is possible. Bet. Big picture wise in retrospect. 3 or 4 centuries from now. This the single most important event of the 20th century will be the discovery on the part of the West of Buddhism. That is a direct quote from Toynbee. So not that the Buddhist. I think the Western World is going to adopt the Buddhist religion. But there are certain discoveries that the Buddha made that I think will will absolutely pass the test of time. Um and turn out to be very important for the whole human race. So that's sort of the basic paradigm that I presented to you and then I said, so OK. That's the modern mindfulness movement. But how about mindfulness itself? What do we think about that? So I think about it as the systematic cultivation and broad application of those core skills? Mindful awareness being defined as concentration power sensory clarity and equanimity working together. So broad application. Reducing suffering elevate fulfillment. Understanding oneself at all levels, increasing skillful actions. Um and ultimately the ultimate application is in discovering a spirit where you want to serve from love. That, in Buddhism, we called the bodhicitta so we taught yesterday about the. Demention of application, which is understanding yourself at all levels and just to make things sort of gives some organization to things I said, we might consider for aspects of that. So one aspect would be more surface, which is to understand your own personality. How do these skills relate to understanding your own personality well as you're sitting and practicing you all notice this sometimes insights will arise spontaneously that are personal insights. You sort of understand yourself. That's nice and that's the result of. Observing yourself in a mindful state. However, there may be aspects of understanding your own personality that don't just percolate up spontaneously in your practice. You may have to go to professional a counselor psychologist psychiatrist to address certain. Aspects of personality if they don't get taken care of automatically by the practice in the way you'll know that the practice hasn't taken care of. It is, you been practicing for 20 or 30 years and People tell you, you're still an * so clearly. Some things you know through feedback you know through. You know things not working out. It's like well, I've learned to transcendent, it doesn't bother me that you know stuff is not working out because of my. My behavior, but actually it should sort of bother you and if the practice can't address it then. Well, there are specialists who work at the personal level. That's what they're trained to do so. The practice may address understanding yourself at the personal level, it. Maybe it's all you need or maybe you need something else. So then there's what might be called? The deaths or the subconscious so certain forms of therapy claimed to address that in fact, your classical therapies. So they don't call a depth psychology for nothing. Freudian union and so forth claim that they get down to that level, whereas other forms of therapy might not. I'm not going to get involved in the Web, whose claims are valid. But it's just something to know about OK there are the deaths. Um part of the depths are personal. But some of them unions would claim that there's a collective unconscious that there's things deep down there that are sort of Universal. So. Um. You may come in direct contact with those depths as the result of mindfulness practice. Um. You will definitely come in directly in contact with them. Um. But once again. There are practices that are not strictly part of mindfulness that are designed to sort of. Touch those levels first of all depth psychology, but Secondly shamanism. Our ancient ancestors all over the world in the tribal forms of culture would contact the spirit world. One nice way to get in contact with that, if you're interested is to do say Native American ceremonies and things like that. Now there's more to the Native American path than that because. Because of the nature in order to find the spirit world typically you do show monic ordeals. Uhm you expose yourself to hot here like Sweat Lodge or Sundance in Japan. You expose yourself to cold. You have to check mantras squatting under a waterfall in winter for hours on end and so all around the world shamanism entails physical sacrifices. And those sacrifices are done within a ritual context? Which of course encourages a concentrated state? And uh encourages a state of equanimity. So, although they may not systematically deconstruct their personhood. Just doing those ceremonies in order to contact the spirit world would tend to have a the effect of taking People into the deepest level. Which is? The source. Which is that formless doing? That I talked about a few minutes ago what proceeds eat sensory and motor arising and what follows each sensory and motor arising is something beyond form and so there's the world of spirits. Which is the subconscious and then there is the great spirit or the Dharma Kyle would College in Buddhism. The formless absolute rest and absolute activity that is at the source of each moment of. Perception an expression. For us, so the result of. Attempts to contact the spirit world. Through what was apparently natural to all of our ancestors all over the world, which is you fast. You expose yourself to heat expose yourself to cold you go without water, you allow yourself to be pierced or scarified or other such things that forces you into the spirit realm that's true. Which also forces you into a state of high concentration and equanimity? Which would then likely lead you to know self or? And experience of touching something that is beyond the spirits, which could be called the great spirit. But as I say in Buddhism. We call it. The Dharmakaya means the body of the absolute and then the realm of spirits is called the sambhogakaya, which is the realm of glorious forms. And then the surface is called that near Mama Kiad, the conventional experience so. Native American specifically and show monic broadly can make a nice compliment to the mindfulness practice because it can. Take you to the experience of the very deepest level that will talk about a little more in a minute, but it also, if you're interested in contacting the quote Spirit World. The Archetypes Realm of archetypes well. That's another specialist that could supplement the mindfulness practice so OK understand the surface individual personality be the practice. Just intrinsically or maybe go to a specialist. I understand the subconscious. Either just through the practice or maybe go to a specialist. Uh. What is another aspect is what I started to talk about yesterday which is? To understand yourself as a sensory system. So. The. Way that I like to do that, it can be done in various ways. But my favorite way is to work with mental image. Mental talk and body emotion reason, I like to work with those 3 sensory elements is that they as far as I can tell. From introspection they form a natural system. Um and I believe that will be able to. Use neuroscience to ferret out those connections. In fact that sort of the main goal of my. My projects at Harvard Medical School are too. Tease out that inner system and see if we can find the neural correlates of it as a system so in any event. Mental image mental talking body emotion emotion, see in here in inner seeing inner hearing and the innermost part of our body experience, which is the emotional body, the limbic system. Um. That. They work together. There is 4 basic things that happen. They all involve the word action. So first of all there is interaction. Mental image can trigger mental talk mental talk can trigger mental image mental image can treat her body motion body motion can build until it turns into an image or body emotion can trigger mental talk or the whole thing can activate simultaneously and they're all sort of triggering each other so you can actually watch how the flow of. Interaction. Occurs within that system and you can unblock that flow. Um so that's the interactivity of those elements. And then there's the reactivity of those elements external sites external sounds physical touch is a rise and then the inner system reacts to those sometimes when you have an arising of touch sight sound and rising of image talk and body motion at the same time. That's That creates the sense of the world over here and me over here as perceiver. Um. So. But what would happen if there was just text sight sound and no inner reactivity at all where you can actually see what would happen by observing the system. You observe the system and sometimes it doesn't react. It. It simply is inactive. And there's no sense of observer. No sense of an eye that earring or seeing there's just seeing just hearing and you are that. And the the barrier between inside and outside disappears. Um. Which makes it rather easy rather natural to have that sense of wanting to serve from love? Because it seems like not just every person but every thing that you look at you inhabit. So they are it. So, sometimes, that system reacts and sometimes that system is inactive. And the other thing that that inner system does is it goes proactive that's my own private language. Proactive means it disengages from the touch sight sound world. And it goes off, and begins to spin memory plan fantasy. Um in neuroscience that's called the default. Network OK, it has a distinctive signature so it's. Off and it's problem, solving or it's worrying or it's fantasizing out of fear or fantasizing out of desire to entertain etc etc. It's like a home entertainment system. It just goes off on its own so you can monitor your understand yourself as a sensory system by observing this so Why is that useful? Well, first of all it can hugely reduce suffering without necessarily changing the content of your sensory experience. Because. When those elements tangle in unconsciousness. And coagulate due to lack of equanimity that vastly increases the suffering associated with unpleasant content. And that vastly reduces the fulfillment that is potentially there when it's a pleasant content. So, just by bringing untangling which is your clarity peace and unblocking which is your equanimity piece by bringing those qualities to that inner system. You achieve 2 of the dimensions of happiness that I talk about reduction of suffering elevation of fulfillment. But it's much more than that. Working with that system is related to understanding yourself because you see Oh yeah. This is this is how it actually arises this IAM nahs. It's also related to improving behavior because um behaviors are preceded by will. I if I have an anger issue or if I have a substance abuse issue or a procrastination issue. That will too. That experience of anger or the will to abuse a substance or the will that says, I don't want to do such and such even though I know I should that arises within that inner system. And so your ability to have equanimity with that. Which will break the identification with the negative vergence and that is not all that's involved in behavior change but that certainly is an important component. If you can stay if you're in recovery and you're Jonesing. For whatever it is a cigarette or drink or whatever. Well, that's going to come up in that system. And if you can track it unblock it not suppress the experience of the desire, but also not lock onto it if you can stay with it and just watch it expand and contract expand and contract for, however long it takes well it will break up the urge will break up and you will that will help you make the behavior change gives you a very systematic way to go about that aspect of behavior change now. The morning group process we talked about the fact that there's more to behavior change then just deconstructing undesirable desires, but that is part of it. So it turns out that working with this inner system is germane to certain aspects of object if positive behavior change. And. It's also. Related. To the love and service piece because? Um. The. Once you see where that system arises from you realize that everyone arises from that same place and. So. Here that's another way that you're always looking at yourself basically so. Untangling those strands. As important in reducing subjective suffering. But it's also important in gaining insight. So. Uh. This is where we left off in the talk yesterday. Buddhism would say that if you carefully observe the components that create the oppression iambus, you'll see that there are only those components. And there actually is no thing inside you. Called itself now first of all. That's counter intuitive because it seems to just about everyone that there is a thing inside me called itself, so why are you trying to tell me there isn't? Um and the other thing is. Even if it's true. Who wants it? What's the payoff for seeing that there's no thing inside you. Called yourself well let me suggest to you, that there are meant the experience that in Buddhism is described as seeing that there's no thing inside you called itself. Is one facet on the jewel of enlightenment? The jewel of enlightenment as a lot of sides to it. That's an important side and anyone that has had these experiences will appreciate why someone would get all excited about pointing out to you, that there is no thing inside you. Called itself, however, that is just one facet of the experience. And there are other ways that that experience can be described for example. It's an experience of connection to all things. It's an experience of the boundary between inside and outside going away or more accurately an experience that let's you realize that the boundary was never there to begin with. Um so. Uh. It's Another way to put it, you could say no self or you could say it allows you to have an elastic self and elastic identity that it can expand and contract it can. Be the normal size. Which is? The normal you. Um or it can reach out. And encompass the larger world that. Everything that you normally don't think of is you. Um. It can reach out and so it could reach out and sort of encompass a person. That's in front of you or the flower that's in front of you so identity gets about this big OK can shrink that would be about this big but it can get a lot bigger it's elastic. Um it can reach out to the ends of the imagined universe. Um so any world systems that you would imagine you embrace them, but it can also shrink down. It can shrink down to inhabit the center of every Atom, I'm speaking metaphorically here so. It is it has been said that poets can see in the dark. I I think it was lorca that said that. So the S American writer but I could be wrong. But I think he said. For its conceive that he's the one that said it case in Point is a high not Maria Rilke RILKE. One of the most amazing poets of all time. I I don't know what kind of ether, he who is poetry from. I mean, you lived like 100 years ago right? Where did he pull that from to be able to say the things he says. Ah, it's inexplicable. Specifically, what he had to say 100 years ago, when Europe was just starting to. Discover Buddhism I mean, just starting knowledge of Buddhism was was ruedemann tree in Europe in his time. He absolutely mailed. The essence of the Buddha's enlightenment. As it would be interpreted in the Japanese, an tradition. Without as far as I know any direct contact with the Japanese and tradition and with rather little contact with. Anything about Buddhism. How do they do it I don't know? But I have a translation of his poem that I'm at made myself from German. On my website but they in there, Gloria, the Buddha in glory. Bitter Allumette and Karen that Turner. Mandel this expansion list would physicist. Jesus Alice is on other ish Turner. His time of hooked flash. Czyca Goosed Center of all centers core of cores. Almond that enclosed itself to Sweeten. All of this to the furthest stars is your fruit flesh. Here my greeting he is congratulating the Buddha on the moment of his enlightenment. The morning after he did put the dead. Yasa and all night, said was enlightened in the morning when he saw the Morning Star, Venus. Um. How did he get it? How did you know about expansion and contraction? And I will leave that to the Buddha. Uh. God kind of remember the rest of it's the Dufus. Uh we need myth now underhand in anything, it's Dina shower on torch data starkers after train. Would from AUS him health Tim Pine. Cashdollar then comes over Virden Dinosaur in fall and clue hint umka trade?

That's the poem that will corrupt to describe the Buitres in language with almost no knowledge of Buddhism. I repeat Watt Ether did, he access to pull that out of so. Center of all centre or of course, all of this to the farthest starts city elastic identity, but you could also call it no self. OK, so how does that come about well early Buddhism would say when you untangle the strands then the something is of self? Is seen as an illusion and where we left off in the talk last night? Was I gave the traditional metaphor for that. The Chariot metaphor from this great scripture called the questions of Kingman Andros, King, but lived out, but Kingman and rose. He was Greek, a Westerner talking to a are hot. Way way way back. And it's the the dialogue is recorded. So the are hot, not nagasena. Quoting Buddhist nun, named Fudge era. Oh said well it's When you dissect a chariot there's just the parts. There's no thing called a chariot. So when you dissect dissect. I am Nahs. There's just group of aid and a son, she aisance Cara Vigiano, there's just. Matter. Feeling. Thought. Um. Subliminal habit forces and Consciousness. And no self there's just those elements and there's no self. In another place in Buddhist literature. The not quite the whole picture of self, but it's self in terms of identifying with the body, saying I am body. There's this extraordinary passage where the Buddha says just as a skillful butcher. Would carve up a steer? Ann. And. At some point, the perception. Steer goes away. And the perception meet arises. So, in the same way the skillful meditator deconstructs the body into. Earth water air and fire 4 elements and the perception. I am a body disappears. And the perception there are just these elements arises so we see in early Buddhism that the notion of untangling strands in order to eliminate a an emergent property. Was not just applied to the 5:00 aggregates. It was also applied to the perception of the physicality of the body and the deconstructive strands worthy. Primitive chemistry of that time. But you know it's sort of works at it actually does work, you can do it. Maybe just for the fun of it up one of these days. I'll give a guide. I've actually done this with People I've done the old-fashioned for element deconstruction of something this of your body you can totally do. It even though we know that as far as physics goes that's Big Lots of pretty primitive view of physics, but it still works. What you do is? Because it's based on experience right, it's it's. They stated as though it's based on object of science, but it's based on sensory experience. So you tune into your body and you find all the bones in the hard parts OK? Well, let's see Earth out right so you like tune into those and get a really good sense of that and then you get a sense of anything that sort of Airy, like your breath or other flatulence or things like that, and then you get like the. Circulation of the watery parts, OK and then you get like you can feel warm things different parts and you just tune into the putative characteristics of the four elements. And you sort of. Get those sensory strands, all separated out and sure enough, you start to experience like well. There's just the four elements. There's not a thing called about it here. So the method of divide and conquer is not limited to the 5:00 aggregates and in fact, I vastly prefer the 3:00 inner elements. Occam's razor if three will do the trick. Why not have 3:00 instead of 4:00 or 5:00 etc? Etc OK so? I'm pointed out that untangling mental image mental talking body. Emotion is my friends at Google would say it's a non trivial issue OK. I love this jargon instead of saying significant or hard. They say nontrivial so this is nontrivial because. Each of these systems is scaled there's if you look in the image space there's the surface images. But those trigger subtle Association images and each of those subtle associations triggers a whole bunch of sutler associations. The bulk of all of this is below. The threshold of ordinary awareness, but with your detection skills and your concentration skills. You can actually detect it not in terms of the content of the content is too fugacious and parallel fugacious means. It just passes, too quickly and it's massively parallel. But you can detect the aggregate the state like the state variable you can sort of take the temperature you could be aware of average kinetic energy as it changes I'm making a metaphor here. OK, but it's sort of analogous to taking pressure temperature, you can see the overall wave form of the subconscious mind in real-time underneath surface, mental talk is sutler talk underneath that is subtler taught same deal that you can watch the sort of changing contour of the system. Likewise, with body motion so untangling is not just untangling. The surface strands, it's untangling all the different strands until all the levels of visual process. Intervisual processing are all sort of nicely over here and all the levels of of auditory thinking over here. The motional bodies over here at all levels are completely separated out what happens at that point is that? The emergent property of something nahs. Disappears. So as I say the traditional metaphor is. The chariot thing where we left off last night as I said. I am I find that metaphor unconvincing. I know it refers to an experience that is absolutely true and very important but. 2. Explain it in terms of sort of taking apart a chariot doesn't seem quite. Convincing so let me give you something that I think is closer. To what's going on are closer metaphor now. Gotta hear loud and clear this is just a metaphor. I'm not saying This is the mechanism. But I think it's closer to the mechanism. We don't know the mechanism. Yet. Scientifically be very interesting when we do, though, so here's something that's a little closer. Most of you have heard me say this a million times, but I'll say it again? So you have an old fashion TV set with a CRT cathode Ray tube not the flat screen kind. But the kind the old-fashioned guide and there's like test pattern and. Big White area and I say there is no white on that screen. And you say are you crazy just look it's mostly white. And I say Are you sure? Let's take this magnifying glass. We agreed that this magnifying glass does 2 things it enlarges but that's not what's important? It resolves. It takes things that for the naked eye fall together. But that are truly separate and it allows you to actually see that separation. That's called the resolution power of the lens. So we know that it doesn't do anything else, it doesn't add or subtract to what's there. And it's really not the magnification. We're interested in is the resolution the clarity. And now I want you to look at that white with this magnifying glass and as you get closer and closer and closer? What's going to happen. The impression white. Disappears. As the reality. Little Red Green Blue Dots Horizons. So. What happened to the white? Well, it was sort of never there to begin with. But it was actually because if you don't look carefully it's there. But if you look very, very carefully without changing anything at all. Now it's not there. There's just red, green and blue. Something like that occurs. With see here inner see, hear feel. When you're not looking carefully. It seems like there's a thing inside you called a self that you're imprisoned in this in these thoughts and emotions. It's not just that it's a thing it's actually a prison. That constrains your identity. But when you finally see it clearly enough. The something this goes away and the. Incarceration potential goes away. Or another way to put it is it was never there. To begin with you just now can see that an undesirable emergent property. That's quite compelling. Vanish is simply through clarity. That's the core inside of early Buddhism. That's knowing yourself as a sensory system. So it may sound rather cold and. Not very relevant to things so I know myself as a sensory system, but actually it's really, really big. Now. Is that to know yourself at the deepest level? Will no I would say that there is a deeper level of knowing yourself and we could actually extend the metaphor. OK, red, green and blue pixels once again do understand just a metaphor just a way of thinking about things red, green and blue pixels. What are? Well, actually. Their radiant electromagnetic energy in the visual spectrum on me and that's how I perceive them. So if we think of its light. So from that perspective it's just there different frequencies of the same thing. What's light haha well that's very interesting question? From a physics point of view, but the metaphor is actually quite. Nice. Because. If you think of red, green and blue is just different frequencies of the same thing. There part of this spectrum radiant electromagnetic Energi. Well then there's a kind of unification. No. So if you Look more carefully. At. The actual substance. Of see here inner see, hear feel. Sure enough, it's sort of like vibrating space. Um and in fact, outer sight sound touch. Has the same quality? So it all becomes an integrated arabesque of Energi. Um vibrant but Sort of transparent. And then you come to realize that what's churning those vibrations. Fermenting them fomenting them. Is that with each sensory and motor arising? There is a kind of effortless E flops and a simultaneous effortless influx that churns those vibrations into existence. The way foam is born in the cleft of a hokusai wave you know, there's that famous picture of Mount Fuji seeing in the in the cleft of a wave right by the Japanese tukio at artist Hocus side. So expect the expanding wave. And a simultaneous contracting wave they? There's a sheer. And in that sheer is born vibration. And that vibration if. It coagulates. Uh. Creates the inner sense that there's a material world on the outside. And the thing called self on the inside. But if you see it just as it is. There is just this effortless E flux and reflux. Like a fountain of Formless Fountain of youth. That's constantly gushing and gathering its center is wherever your attention goes. And it's perimeter encompases the whole self and seen. Um. That is the dynamic side of. The source that is the deepest experience of the Dharmakaya in terms of its activity. Um, however, that activity comes from and returns to an absolute rest that always pervades it. So it's eternally it's A kind of eternal fountain of youth. A formless womb. That moment by moment gives rise to self at world. Whereas it activates. But. It arises from and returns to at his peppered by. Shalom beam romov. The Peace of God's own heaven. This is prayer. I remember it vividly from being a little boy. We in synagogue Oh say Shalom in Rome of who you are says Shalom Alenu, Valcol, Israel. They improve army made one that creates RCR. It's a creation mean the one that creates the piece of his own. Heaven give peace to you and all of Israel course for me is right does it mean a country it's? Anybody who struggles for the Lord is rhe. Ale it has a meaning in Hebrew struggle. To experience L the source that's my interpretation of Israel anyway. Other People have other interpretations. I'm sure, but I've chosen that means. Not a race not a country so if I sometimes I I'll sing that, but that's what I mean. The Shalom, the peace that comes with completeness shall actually moot. Um that's That's what the Christian poet. TS Eliot called the still point of the turning world that I quoted from last night at the still point of the turning world. Neither movement from their torrents. The restful part is when the movement in and out ceases. When the movement in it out starts well that's when they creative activity occurs. The. In the Jewish Mystical tradition. That pulling apart of acid and grew a of contraction and expansion. They even have terms for it's just amazing. It's amazing. It's called SIM Soman creates a space and then. That space vibrates. So that's what happens for everyone. Um. In each moment of inner and outer see, hear feel. And in each act of speech or body movement or thought. That's the primordial great perfection. To touch it is to know true love? Um so. That's to understand its yourself at that deepest possible level. Um. And. It's If that becomes A moment by moment reality. Then it's quite easy to have this sense of wanting to kinship with everyone including. People you don't like. It's you know relate to Flowers, but you can also relate to garbage cans, you can relate to. Uh. Your personal heroes. But you can also relate to. People fear or dislike. Or embarrass you. Um. Uh. The trick is to realize that. That's always 1st. Before the reactivity can arise. It's nothing wrong with judgments. I have nothing wrong with judgment OK. I definitely have opinions like certain. Politicians I don't like other politicians OK, I have my opinions. But I know for sure. Before my opinion arises. Ah, when I first look. Or hear that person. The first thing that I experience is the source loving them into existence. That does not preclude me having opinions and judgments. It's just. It makes some very different context to things. I'm more pre marrow.","title":"Journey to True Spirituality ~ SHINZEN YOUNG"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/just-laughing-a-mindfulness-meditation-stephanie-nash/","text":"id: just-laughing-a-mindfulness-meditation-stephanie-nash title: 'JUST LAUGHING' - a Mindfulness Meditation ~ STEPHANIE NASH hide_title: false sidebar_label: 'JUST LAUGHING' - a Mindfulness Meditation ~ STEPHANIE NASH So what we're going to do is you're going to close your eyes and I I will guide it from there.

And it's a tradition at a lot of retreats. I give a whole talk about strategies for doing it. And why People do it, so maybe I can give you the executive summary. At night, there's an altar alternation of brain chemistry that occurs and that can sort of give you an interesting perspective from which to the practice different themes tend to come up for one thing each wave of Sleepiness Induces, a wave of rest that's why People lurch because. Actually, what's happening is this physical relaxation, so you can get into a rhythm where if you happen to be sleeping. You won't necessarily be sleepy, but you may be at some point sleepy? What happens is is that you notice how the sleepiness comes in waves. And each wave will tend to cause the body to physically relax and it could also cause see rest and heuristic but turn off the mental talk and it could cause either bright light or darkness. Sort of undifferentiated visual experience so at least feel rest and perhaps also see rest in here rest get. Triggered. Rhythmically by rhythmic waves of sleepiness now if you can sort of get into that. Rhythm then what happens is your reengineering the experience of sleeping us into the experience of meditative absorption because there's something if you've read about if you read sort of the Dharma or Buddhist scholasticism. There's something called the Bhavanga Sota, Buffalo. Hunger sorta so above our means existence on Guardians support. Or underpinning and so timing stream So what is the Pomona soda? Well, that's the boundary zone between conscious the conscious mind in the unconscious mind now in meditative absorption. And in falling asleep and in dying in those 3 circumstances. We dip below the pavona soda so there's an intimate link between those 3 things and. The ability to. Drop below the Bellagio so to and not lose consciousness is a big deal. In fact to live and function below the befunge soda is too. Is to solve the Co op that I'm going to give you? Actually, I just gave away the answer moving like ordinary life. Below the stream of existence would mean that you're alive in the on board. You're functioning from the Apple so all mine sitting is. An opportunity to explore dipping below that boundary. So now if you dip. Unconsciously then you're going to have the Zen lurch OK. But if you get into the rhythm that I'm describing it will just take you deeper and deeper on the see if I can remember. I need your some. I need your shema weather be here. That's how you say it in Hebrew and learn that last time in Israel. I need I you should not sleep? Velopex and or but my heart. My consciousness ear is awake. I sleep with my heart wake. If it's from the Psalms. The Latin is a go demeo said. Kortmann vigilant and that was used as an ideal by the Christian monks in the Middle Ages when Latin was the language that was used the. Canonical hours that the monks keep which we still have remnants in our language in words like Magina and noon OK. It's known as the 9th hour, etc, etc. Mattens is the afternoon law, making the morning logs. I can't remember there's there's a certain set number of hours that. Mouse kept an very few orders still do this, but a few do, and essentially it's like a radical disruption of the sleeping cycle because they never get more than a few hours sleep and then they have to go to the. The Chapel and either do chanting or singing or have a liturgy of some sort or mass or something and I think it's like 7 times in a 24 hour cycle. So it's like waking up in the middle of the night while sleeping all the time lifestyle thing. It never varies ever. So what's that all about why be sleeping, all the time. Why I never get any continuous sleep for your whole life well? For that reason, Eggo Dormael said Cormier visually you learn how to bring consciousness into. Sleep. So it's not sleep anymore. What is it well in Christianity. It was called infused contemplation but in Buddhism. It's called Formless JAMA? So one way to go about that. That's used in them and obviously also was used in Christianity is to re engineer. The sleepiness thing so one facet is you can write it into these delicious restful states. Of course takes a little practice like a lot of practice. So I'm not guaranteeing that you will experience I sleep, but my heart makers. And tomorrow morning be in light that live the rest of your life in the unborn but you can take some sort of step in that direction. No, I'm sort of convincing myself that I should join. Look at oceans do it, she started that she knew this was she was shaking her head. You would before she was like convincing myself and I want to do this. Well, now, you probably think I'm a whip right that I can't do it well prove it slightly army. Sir could you do that you're supposed to be able to ask your? Sergeant to do anything he asks you to do is etc, etc. But not really convincing myself well. The truth is, you deserve my a game tomorrow, which may not manifest. If I'm too sleep deprived I can still function, but maybe not the A game function OK so. But other things come up it's not just explore the restful states you may never get mental image as well at 3:00 in the morning. Maybe you have met all my pitches. Dreamscape starts to replace the landscape that could be well. I never space is never available to me well. Maybe it'll be available at 3:00 this morning, so that could be a little window of opportunity, the world is solid well at 3:00 in the morning. Maybe it won't be so solid as your eyes swim now. You might say well. That's * * because that's just you know you're just tired and that's an optical illusion, but it's also a place to stand to explore visual experience. And if you do an awful lot of that it will give you insight into the impermanent nature of C out. That's there when you're quite recovered and looking quite normally at the world. You still have this knowledge of flow within that experience so not a whole lot of interesting things can happen as the result of the Aza so there are reasons to do it. There is also of course, we can sometimes be comfortable physically there's this sticky. Crawley sort of. Like yucky I think on your face right coagulate. It yucky and a sort of excruciating yawning us, but just sits in your chest hour after hour after hour and then there could be all sorts of emotions that come up because we're in. We're a little non Compus Mentis, I mean, it is the classic way to break People down right with brain washing and so forth. So now I'm giving he really kind of sales pitches. It comes to buy this product. However, the People that are committed to this practice now that there is such a thing. There is a thing called working through stuff. And the same process that breaks People down. Also can break People up. If you follow the distinction Ah to be broken down is a disempowering experience of abuse to be broken up is an empowering experience of abuse broken down. It means you're like shattered glass broken up your Apple Marty or like. Spray of pure. Ah. Steam. That now joins the flow of nature forever. So anyway. So I didn't intend to talk about yasa, but Oh let me just give those of you that are have never done. It first timers going to give you a reality check? How many people in this room have done on all night, said. How many people in this room have done it again? So you can see this is not like Oh my God? No one could do this kind of **** kind of thing right so that's that's why as a rap extemporize.","title":"LATE NIGHT SITTING CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/laughing-meditation-workshop-stephanie-nash/","text":"And then the only CB captain what I didn't get a chance to do last time because we run the zendo and it was a form of meditation. So I didn't get a chance to really introduce this, or give some exercises or a certain way of kind of working with it practically so I wanted to take advantage of this to do that, laughing as you know is like a universal language. It doesn't matter where in the world, you are everybody knows what that is. We all share that this human beings and their laughing muscles by the way it's the same is crying right. It uses the document. The same way and I'll talk about that in a second an OC. I had my whole life, but then it goes off, and then I see my cute puppies there and it's used. I mentioned for therapy. When my mom got cancer. They told her to laugh. I've used it with People who've been locked into depression for you facilitators, especially. Any emotion, but especially depression because anger and fear have an energy to them and depression doesn't and there's a dynamic enerji. It can happen here that can suddenly shift to a habit of this and go Oh. I see my arms you can go different ways, so that's impractical use of it physiologically. Some People body functioning's get better digestion and things like that, your massage ING right. All sorts of internal organs and of course flow is better than a single digit integer greater than one in my file. I thought Channing OK. So it's something that we can practice and just like concentration censoring clarity and equanimity. We practice them here, so that our lives get better. Not so that were really good with her eyes close right so laughing is something that you can practice and stretch like a muscle and then in your life. There's more of a chance that things will be funnier or it can literally open muscles. I'm going to talk about how actors work with their instrument. Their bodies are instrument. An you want to your instrument. You want it to be open to any possible choice of an impulse that may happen in a moment so. You have to stretch the body in certain ways. And if you want to play the Queen of England hanging out like this doesn't quite do it, so you kind of got to work with that. You got to play someone who's frightened all the time just kind of bringing the body like this might help if you're playing somebody who last all the time you know it's kind of hanging on like this and looking around just kind of changes how you see the world. You know, so you can just kind of play with how the body can affect your emotions and that's something that I. Just want to mention that laughter is part is a subset. Of this figure category of the physicality of the body and how it can affect our mind and our emotions and I just gave examples of ways to hold the body. But in acting for example. There is a wife if I want to create somebody who's fearful or I could just hold the body like this without any thinking and those feelings can come up right want to be confident I can do Wonder Woman, right or whatever. And you know, those feelings so, so I just want to mention this as an aside to meditators because I first started teaching something called body and locking and laughing was a small part of it, but where People I'd hear the reports. It retreats of these great insights into OK. Let's use fear of an insight into Oh wow. I have that response. People really doing some deep processing and experiencing this freedom and then they get up off the cushion and the body goes back into this. And they say I don't know why but I keep getting those fearful thoughts or that those fearful feelings keep coming up and I kind of want to say, well. That's kind of an engraved invitation. That's how we create them is actors right so I just want to throw that in and that's what I do on the outside is kind of getting the body kind of so that it's supportive to the internal process here. We work with mental image and internal Top we have the body posture. And sitting practice or walking practice, but we don't really deal with this other part of it. So I just want to throw that in there since. Laughter is a subset of that, although laughter is unique unto itself because it is not just a way. We hope the body. It's a dynamic expression of sensory feeling Anet uses breathing and breath in a very dynamic way. An I'm sorry. I didn't want it for everybody, but I recording it so you can order. Does that make sense? what I just said cool alright. So OK that was all I had to say that I had notes for all right, So what I wanted to do was mentioned 2 techniques that 2 master teachers want an acting teacher. Wanna meditation feature have used to kind of help ghost People into big laughter. In a certain kind of way, and then when I do laughing meditation. I don't try to goose People into big laughter. I just let whatever arises arises and just the sound of someone with a silly laughed can get to going to simply discovered last time but I wanted to use what they present is a kind of warm up for us in that stretching because it uses a dynamic use of breath. So 1st is a master acting teacher when I was a DL school of Drama and we had our chekov class and everything you hear Tianshan city about ro she's kind of applies here and someone would do something he take no law. And she was laughing. And he'd say no and he'd slap his hand on their table and he'd let all the air out of his body and then make whatever sound was whatever left that sounded like the end of a big left. And then you had to gasp for air coming in and then he would continue expanding and contracting in this uncontrollable laughter. As we just kind of stunned watched him and then realized later we were laughing to his name is orchestra and I do this today in honor of him because right after I studied with him. He lost his voice and has a voice box with throat cancer. So this is an honor of sharing but other People can't hear him anymore. What he gave us so I have to sit because he sat when he did it but I will demonstrate what he did, and we can try it as an exercise for 36 he would slap this, let all the air out go and I've been in silence. and I haven't done this in about 15 years ago, 20 but we'll just see how it goes. Hi. The technical use of pushing out air just letting whatever's out there getting wherever you can. And just kind of Gone with it. An I thought just as an exercise. This is in our laughing meditation. This is a warm up, you know like doing like so if you would like to try it with me now you can feel free to slap if you like to. Goodnight. Only my screen oldest left. I could feel of how it is kinda right OK, I can see how you just get Karen warmed up. Then you can even talk anymore. Alright so Nicola Geiger? How many People here in new Nicola. OK, for those who didn't. She was one of shin sons first teacher. He often refers to her as the first functioning booty sought for that he ever knew because she welcomed mobsters and monks alike and she would come to retreat. She's a big German woman, she went through. Germany during a difficult time, and part of a White Rose movement and she come to retreats and she'd have her cane and she had a laugh that would make Santa jealous and she would say basically until now. My dad it is time by a tapping meditation. You know, she would just that kind of sound Nicola ask right now. Right and so she we were talking. I was having a private session with her one time and I didn't know about. I've never seen her do a laughing meditation and I told her how I was using laughing in performances and things. I thought it shifted People zenergy to always put it in and she'd say. Let's I'm going to show you how to do a laughing meditation and then she had a very technical way of doing it now once again. I'll kinda give you a little taste of what it is I cannot do Nicholas lab. I just don't have the mechanics for that. But I will give the what she taught me I took notes, I haven't looked at them since. She taught me what 7 years ago, or however. Long it was. I don't know so she had it went Ho Ho. Ha ha ha. OK and she would have us clap where she would use her cane, but it would be hope Oh. Ha ha ha. It would be like that. And so should start and you get through about three of those before you go so it would be something like. To do it without you guys like makes it a little bit of a performance so I'm just really trying to do. Nicholas laughing medication. My visual envisioning her here should be OK. My dad and then we go up because just listening to her left once again. Made you I'm not a Ho Ho Ha ha. Kind of you know, I go where he he. So just in honor of Nikola, who is no longer with us. But today, we honor her as well, and you don't have to click, but she insisted I do so. You might be what she would say something like that, and then of course, when you're done. You ring so bad. Yes, she would do that. You wouldn't be able to do it without ringing a Bell so when rings about. Any my dad Yeah, we yes, my dear, Yes, those have you heard or death that sound familiar right OK. That's true. A lot OK and then I don't know what's going to happen. 'cause whenever do last meditation. I don't know it's usually usually I'll do it a date may the end of a sit. You know the way People do meta. Maybe we've gone through a lot of focus on feel into dark places or if a guy did something it would change the whole energy in the room, I might do it before we want People to work with flow. Turn in your bodies right now, just from doing. Feel any flow that was less than 60 seconds. That will happen. Hey. So I'm now going to guide. Oh, and so when I got it a nice clothes pract. If you want to open your eyes just like any practice open or close as you will, but I find there's actually someone told me that there's only so much real estate consciousness and you know. And then he'll say it emotions expand IQ contracts. But what I'm going to say is it's like with eating meditation. You close your eyes and you can taste more so in the same way you closures. You can really tune into the feel and the flow and it will be a focus end focus out focus on sound and some People get a lot of images I get none. I it's just it's total other thing for me, but you know you now have. Plenty of techniques and retreat so, So what we're going to do is you're going to close your eyes and I will guide it from there. So we're now going to do a meditation. Called a laughing medication and laughing is optional. And feel free to jump in at anytime, but I will pick some guidance. Yeah, or maybe? Clap your hands. Well. You can tune into expansion and contraction. Thank you. Oh. Cortana. Hello. Hello. Hello. The good abdominal workout. I. Nice deep pleasure wilsie really big with it. I already did nothing. That was 10 minutes in honor of all laughing. Meditation People everywhere OK, so close your eyes and tune into your body? What's going on? And if sounds happen, it's just like little aftershock side so. Thank you just really tune and feel the flow where are you feeling? Anything that wants to spread let it. Open to the massage. From the inside through the bye. What's with face real life? Belly. Hands feet. Thank you. Very serious. No. And hear the sounds of laughter in other peoples l'africa, Palin on your body. I. But is it pays me to do. So the next time sheds shows it's like building. Till let me let you stop laughing in my prescription for life. If you do 10 minutes of this today, no problem. You know. You can pepper your day. Stop pause go to nothing, Anri manifest with it. Why I make my actors all learn to laugh on cue, and they're not allowed to fake it and they have to laugh in a way that makes us all left and the first time someone does it. They go and I got no, I got Kevin is having to go. You know jump right into it, so it's a great skill to develop and it's created a party. So thank you all for exploring this.

Thoards enlightenment affect the nature of the. Enlightenment be quick and easy answer is if you were to focus only on the breath and come to an enlightenment experience through that. It would be Essentia Lee, the same kind of experience that a person would have if they did a more systematic deconstructive path or if they did a reconstructive path like the Vad Rihanna Path, where you sort of create an alternate identity from scratch. That's archetypal. I would say they all take you to Essentia Lee, the same. Type of experience, but Having said that. The confounding factor is that although it's essentially the same ballpark. Enlightenment is like a many faceted jewel there's so many different sides to it. So what side you're going to emphasize may slightly be influenced by what path you took. But not necessarily you might take a certain path there and when you get there decide to emphasize something quite different. In contrast to what the path was that took you. There also unfolds with time. One of my teachers used to say cure know Satori while I start know much you got that means today's enlightenment is to models mistake, not mistaken the sense of fundamental mistake but in the sense of well. Newtonian physics is basically right, but Einstein had something to say. An then Richard Feynman had something else to say that built on this so it's like science. It's many faceted so it will present itself to you over the years in different aspects. So who for example, my main teachers, Sasaki Roshi. When I met him. He was already a Masters Master. I mean he was already a senior Roshi when I first met him. Is now 100? 203. I've known him for 2526 years now over those 2, 1/2, decades, I have seen him evolve. And hone is paradigm and changes emphasis so he was already in Masters Master and he is discovering new facets of this. At that at that level so I would say that. The path that you take, will somewhat influence how you conceptualize the experience but. Not it's not necessarily going to constrain it in some way and in fact, you may end up doing something quite different ending up with quite a different paradigm. So I would say it's a matter of depth and what facet you're choosing to emphasize, rather than a matter of what? Technique you use to bring you to that.","title":"Many Facets of Enlightenment"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/meditation-bar-a-comic-dharma-skit-stephanie-nash/","text":"id: meditation-bar-a-comic-dharma-skit-stephanie-nash title: 'MEDITATION BAR' (a comic dharma skit) ~ STEPHANIE NASH hide_title: false sidebar_label: 'MEDITATION BAR' (a comic dharma skit) ~ STEPHANIE NASH About you, but after a good retreat.

Yeah, there's a lot of good places around here purification pub hochland hatch. Epoche Attica Nietzsche Annex and the axis of ego, which is too noisy for my tastes just doesn't have a good feel to it. Oh, and there's the clarification cafe. They got * for eating meditation. There, a mechanical hand comes down, and stops your arm right as you lift the food than a voice comes on saying Meditate on that. Yeah, they got therapists in the next room from when it doesn't workout. My favorite place is the pass and a vortex used to be called's than it is when it was owned by this guiding Roshi But. He had a lot of activity and moved on to another level of consciousness. The for passing a vortex is situated in a way that you can see right through it.

It translates apart site through site and insight all fit fits welcome. Chill greets me at the door, she runs the place. A Great Dane with a solid gold heart and smiled a match she says. Is that a guru in your pocket or are you just happy to be here? I smile and head over the bar for a clarity cocktail. I got some fuzzy aspects. I could use a good buzz. The Bliss bunnies are circulating and free floating throughout the room, giving out labels. Sometimes they take you upstairs and show you a rising and falling as usually some flow there, too. There is my friend well it's got a horse named Charlie Yeah. Wells alot like Charlie Horse, but he'll never see it. Yeah. I see Shenzi over his usual booth. He owns the place you can tell his booth by the charts and graphs. Yeah, he's a geek and Indesign mathematics, but don't let the glasses fool you. He may be able to say somebody in a dozen languages, but he can get your son skates flowing better than nasal spray.

They start with the nose and her sometimes known to Pierce through the whole body fear into that kind of thing. Back when Roshi own the place it was a Zen arcade allowed a parlor games learning their clap with one hand, making faces like before you were born that kind of thing.

It is the best thing that ever happens to you. Except you can't remember a thing.

Her name is Melissa Man\u00e1. Yeah, she's a bit self absorbed but she sings a good song. Sometimes the show was solid sometimes restful, but it always flows and before you know it. It is over gone could put I chill with the solid hang with the restful and go with the flow and when it's over nothing Nada 0. But that's how it goes. I'm going back to the bar for a second clarity cocktail before the show. I want to get a good seat. It's been nice chatting with you. Or have I been some.

But I got a note about in daily life when we were talking to People how can we? Formulate strategies for meditating or for doing a practice when talking to People well sometimes when you're talking to someone, it's a substantive conversation. So you really need like 100% of your CPU to be carrying on that, so in those cases. You just have to accept the fact that you can't actually implement. A or not I don't want to put it that way. You may not be able to implement a unintentional strategy. 'cause you have to just be paying attention to what's going on? However, there is a gradation in our conversations with people with regards to how substantive the conversations are. A lot of conversations that we have with People are not do not require our total CPU. If you follow my metaphor to be engaged with that person. So. We get an interesting figure ground reversal here. Normally good conversations are ones that are substantive and just listening to somebody Blabber or shoot the breeze with vacuous social cliches or what have you. Those are considered like not great conversations? But here's where the figure ground reversal comes in. Those now become the great conversations. You understand why. Because you've got some wiggle room you got some extra. Yeah, Energi. That you can use to implement a formal strategy. So. You can just. Listen to People talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and daughter OK. And it's great. The more they talk and the less you talk, the easier. It is to continue implementing your technique. So it gives you a completely different way of thinking about interactions. So then you train yourself. You are responding to them You're not spacing out, but your training. A variety of possible focus strategies, So what are some of the things that you could train under these circumstances? Well, one thing is. You can use part of the focus out thing you can anchor yourself in the sights and sounds of that person, you're really listening and you're really looking. That's one strategy another strategy is meta in the body. You sort of you know, we look at People we smile. It's sort of social convention, but you can use Samadi to inflate that social smile into a real like whole body experience of unconditional love just pouring out of your ports. It can be trained and it's very powerful once you learn how to do this. So one of my most common strategies for meditating in conversations is OK. The sites and some of the person or the The Loving kindness kind of thing. Other strategies are possible. The important thing is, you sort of pick your battles. You say OK? Guess Wat in this conversation. I got enough wiggle room that I can respond appropriately. And be implementing this technique. Um. So People often worry, though well if I'm implementing a formal technique while having a conversation with someone. Number one what People have 2 worries 1st it's like. Well, I'll get so involved in the technique that I won't be able to be appropriate. That's the worry number wanted worry #2 is I'm going to look weird. Or they're going to see that I'm like secretly doing this whatever I mean? Oh, OK, so let's address the first concern. Like the proverbial you know, Pat your head and rub your belly or is it. Yeah, I guess it's that way. So you might be a little awkward. Initially, but People usually don't notice. And then you gain some facility to it, you can keep the technique going and you know responded. You don't feel awkward at all, so yeah, you might need to be willing to a little bit. Awkward initially because you're not using the ordinary strategy that we use when we're having conversations with People. The ordinary strategy that we use when we have conversations with People is we're constantly going. Into our seeing hearing feeling system to plan what we're going to say next constantly being pulled back into the subjective world. Now you're starting I mean of course, that could be a technique. You could be observing you're seeing here and feel in reactions to that person, however, in that case you're observing them You're not actually buying into them are using them to plan what you're going to say next. So that's where the little awkwardness may come in for a little while because it's like whatever strategy you're doing, even if it's observing your reactions certainly if it's a focus out or a radiate love from your body thing you're not constantly now going back to see in here and feel in to figure out what you're going to say next and if you pay close attention. You'll see that's what we constantly do. So you might feel a little bit awkward, yes initially. But then you learn that you actually don't need to constantly go to that place in order to be appropriate. So that takes care of concern number one concern #2? Well, they'll know that you're doing a technique will guess what? Your technique is not to Disengage from them. You are anchoring in their sights and sounds or you are radiating in all directions, including their direction unconditional positive regard. So, in fact, you're more engaged with them. In fact, what disengages People is that constant pulling to tored your own mind and emotions. That's reactive or planning and so forth so if that doesn't happen, but then actually People feel that your. Like really giving them attention and you're giving them time and space and and People find that very attractive. So essentially The less something you have inside yourself as you're interacting with the person. That that sort of emptiness. Is like a magnet OK? There's that person unless there and experienced practitioner has a constant pressure of seeing here and feeling. You're now learning how to communicate with that person without having within yourself that constant pressure of seeing hearing feeling that creates in a good sense of vacuum inside you so it's like an osmotic gradient or a pressure gradient. The ego pressure that they have can dissipate in the space of your ego absence. And that creates a force that attracts People tordue. A kind of magnetic force, they don't know why OK but there pulled by that pressure gradient. If my metaphor makes any sense at all, so be willing to take a chance and start flapping your lips without planning what you're saying. And as you get better and better and better at that you will eventually learn how to write the ox backwards. That's a Zen metaphor the flow of expansion and contraction itself will begin to move your lips and tongue for you and you'll discover that magically powerful an appropriate things are. Moving across your teeth. Without you actually quite even knowing until it's too late. But then it's like the Magic happened. It takes a long time to train the ability to do that. You have to be willing to somewhat throw caution to the wind and just as I say start manifesting lot of times People work against themselves in meditation practice. 'cause they go into some really deep state and then the Bell rings. And it's like Oh, I gotta reconstitute myself in order to be able to deal with the world. Well, that's like wasting what you just did OK. It's like. No, the whole idea is your in this really deep state you're sort of. Spacious. Disoriented the Bell rings time to deal with the world. Just continue to be spacious and disoriented and start moving, and yeah, there might be a little awkwardness initially but you discover that that all that is needed is the activity of the personality. The something this of the ego is. Not really necessary to navigate the world and to interact with one's fellow beings so the whole idea is you. It's like the Bell rings and no don't like OK. I gotta get myself in the world solid again. No no no OK, you just start being space moving through space and. Let the manifestation of curb.","title":"Mindfulness Strategies when Interacting with Others ~ SHINZEN YOUNG"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/mindfulness-with-sickness/","text":"So. Uh. I'm aware that some People are dealing with the challenge of being sick and so forth well. It's interesting in a Zen Temple being sick. They have all this special vocabulary for everything ordinary ordinary things have their own sort of like special things so they don't say Bill Key, which means the normal Japanese word for being sick. They have this expression buell soul. Which means Uh. The symptoms of illness or the appearance of Hilmes, OK OK. So instead of saying this monkey is sick. They say this monk is showing the form of sickness. Like the appearance of sickness pills sold meaning of course, there's a there's a little bit of an implication. That there is a sensory experience of being sick and then that's a map that is a form a manifestation. The implication of course, being that eventually you want to be able to escape into the sensory event of being sick to build soul Japanese, there's another word in Japanese there's just no English equivalent. Out which is not ekiru noticible means you deal with it by Totaly becoming it. You so become it that everything else is cut off nerdy not narrow means you become kiddo means you cut so you so become it that everything else is cut up off utterly achieve oneness with it or more idiomatic expression in English might be complete commitment. There's a complete commitment to. Just experiencing being sick. Um. Now the good thing is. The lucky thing for us. Um is if you are sick. I'm going to encourage you as much as you want to like sleep and rest and take breaks and and so forth. Uh. But in the sand temple you're not allowed to do that no matter what you have to just you have to follow the schedule. No matter how sick you are. And that is really misery OK. I didn't get sick, much, but you know every once in awhile we got. Inoculated against Japan Encephalitis 'cause you know you get bit by mosquitoes right. And. Oh Man, I had a reaction to the shot. But it's like. There's no mercy, you just have to keep doing the schedule right no matter how you feel. I remembering I'd forgotten that was very unpleasant. There was summer 2 things like hot course. A lot better than getting Japan encephalitis, but anyway. Uh so yeah, there's actually a long tradition of using the sickness for your practice. But here you know you have the luxury that you can take it easy if you need to, but even when you're taking it easy try to make you not begrudge. The fact that all I got sick now. I can't have an retreat that is the retreat that's in daily life. Injury illness visiting the hospital whenever I work with students that they're calling me from the hospital. I'm evidence operation event thing going on. I say I always have a stock phrase, I say OK here in your having a non consensual retreat. Not being forced into a situation where there's nothing to do, but Explorer the prospect of happiness. Independent of conditions goes. This condition is going to go on for a little while. Before there was John or is the Japanese call it Zen in China. There was 10 tie. That was the first meditating School of Chinese Buddhism and that was actually at a relatively early period before the tongue during the sway dynasty is when that started and then it gained momentum in the early tongue. Um. Uh. They came up with a very interesting way to Meditate. The Linneage did not survive. Though the linea je practice. Although the texts have survived. Other lineages like Sean or Zen and Pure Land and so forth survived. In that in China but tent. I didn't although it has been preserved in Japan. It's called 10 die in Japanese reason, I'm mentioning it is that the first meditation manual that I'm aware of in the Chinese language. Is called? Was written by the tent? I dasher the master? Who created that entice system and it's in 10 chapters. It's called the more hattrick one which means? More has actually Sanskrit word incorporated into Chinese. It's mAh ha, which means big right or great. True means in. Mandarin means to stop and Quan means to see or observed so the The Great stop and see so stop it translates shamatha. And one and C Orc one translates free passion, so before there was the words water on in Mandarin, which zazen in Japanese that's the normal word in Chinese and Japanese for meditate. But before that word existed in East Asia. The word for Meditate was Chuck One, which means to do summat uh be passionate to do. Coming concentrating but also observing insight mixed together in any event. When I will before I practiced. Meditation I was academic studying at a scholar of it and I was fortunate because. Before I even got interested in Buddhism was literate in both Chinese and Japanese. I could read those Asian languages. Fluently so all my early study of Buddhism was done actually by reading books in Chinese and Japanese about Buddhism and one of the books that I read was this manual by 10 Thai. It's like this is something that was written in. The 7th century AD in China. So, like over let's like over a Millennium ago and half a world away. Um. But you could. Sort of have an intimacy with the person that wrote this. By reading what they had to say in reading about their struggles reason I'm mentioning this is 10. Chapters and just like I attempt to do. He very systematically lays out the nuts and bolts of practice and relates it to various scriptures. Particularly the Lotus Sutra was central to this particular school. So. One of those chapters and in tight it's an entire chapter devoted to just. The whys and wherefores of. Practicing when you're sick and it was a long time ago that I read it. I don't remember the details. But I remember thinking tent, I must have himself had a lot of challenge fit. Health challenges and it must have been very difficult for him to achieve what he achieved and that's probably what's motivating. You know that's This is probably based on his own experience. So it's like a whole section. It's like a 10th of the book. The first meditation manual in East Asia is about not be grudging. The fact that you're sick, but OK, you do this. You do this. You do this. You do this. Here's how you can treat illnesses. I see to remember now there was some Chinese Medison in there also seem to remember. That there was some Dow is magic in there to sort of make certain kinds of spirits cause certain kinds of illnesses, and you can militate against them with this, or that I seem to remember that, but mostly what I remember is the notion OK, you're going to get sick. That's Just an opportunity for practice and don't begrudge the fact and just don't lose a beat use it for your practice so you know how you can do that within the context of what we're doing, you apply a technique basically if you have a sensory challenge. There are 2 fundamental strategies and you can plan a Plan B and you can alternate plan A and Plan B. Plan, A is turned towards it. Untangle unblock gnarly to totally become it. How do you go beyond hotter cold when it's hot you boil to death when it's cold you freeze to death you just become it. So that's that's plan a I call that strategy turned torrents now when you take a turn Thord strategy you. Need concentration clarity and equanimity to do that successfully. The flip side of that is by attempting to focus on it. In a systematic wait you will develop concentration clarity and equipment. So it's an exercise in those skills. So you are developing those skills. But now you're also applying those skills to deconstructing or having a complete experience of whatever the sensory challenges Plan B is turn away. Hum. So turn away would be in terms of. Possible focus range well, you could let's say that the let's say that the challenges is physical discomfort of an illness. So what is? What is the sensory gestalt for physical discomfort? We talked about it in the group process this morning? There's the uncomfortable physical sensation and then there's the reactivity of the Inter system. To that, so and the uncomfortable physical sensation. Will often resolve into one or more local intensities and then a more subtle global spread subtle is significant on so you've got. Local intensity global spread in feel out the physicality of the body and then you have the inner system mental image. Mental talk body emotion reacting possibly to that or being impacted by that. At. So. That's five sensory elements, local physical discomfort global physical discomfort mental image. Mental talk and body emotion. So you can work with the parts. You can work with the whole. Untangle unblock. Um that would be to focus a turn toward strategy. What's a turn away strategy well anything. That's not that so you could anchor in sights and sounds? Up sometimes when I work with People well severe chronic pain, acute chronic pain. The only thing they can do is they just have to get away from the mind and the body because the mind and body are just untenable. The only thing they could focus on is sights and sounds so anchor out or maybe you can access restful states. Seriously arrest feel restaurant, maybe you can nurture positive. Image start body motion on so. An alternative strategy Plan B is turn away. Um now there's a tendency to think that. If I turn away that's denial and suppression. Um Unfortunately there's also a tendency to think if I turned towards that's just going to make it worse and reinforce it. I think you can see that if you buy into those 2 beliefs. You literally have no place to turn you set yourself up for abject suffering So what I would like to encourage People is to consider that in fact, both of those options are viable strategies. Why? Because the turn away also entails concentration clarity and equanimity your ability to do it. Is depends on those skills on the other hand, the attempt to do it? Builds those skills so you're developing and applying the same skill set. Concentration power let's say you're anchoring insight and sound because the mind and body are untenable. So you get pulled away from sights and sounds so you keep coming back. That's concentration power sensory clarity, while the sights and sounds might be subtle relative to the intensities that are going on in my body space. Well, that ability to detect subtle things. That's a sensory clarity or specifically when you're working on restful states see rest. You rest feel rest. Typically, the restful states are quite subtle relative to the activations, but you're developing sensory clarity by the ability to detect remember sensory clarity has. 2 depending on how you wanna look at it 3 Sub Dimensions. Resolution power that the ability to distinguish. On. Ah sensitivity the ability to detect subtle signals. Those are different things. They both come under clarity and if you want to make it more complicated, but also more traditional you can say there's another aspect to clarity what the say adult school penetration. Um so OK, one aspect of clarity is detection, so the ability to detect subtle things may be involved, probably will be involved in a turn away strategy and how 'bout equanimity well your willingness to allow the sensory challenge to expand and contract in the background. While your attention is focused in the foreground on something else. That's background equanimity so like I say I like to divide. The skills it not only into dimensions, but sub dimensions, so the ability to. Open up and turned towards that's one kind of equanimity foreground equanimity the ability to. Turn away but at the same time open up in the background. That's actually a related but independent skill that I call background equanimity and I encourage People to develop both of those equanimity skills. Now we've talked about concentration. The ability to hold something small but also the ability to hold something large, the ability to hold one thing for a long period of time or the ability to taste momentary concentration on a variety of things. These are dimensions within the clarity skill so I'm going to say that if you elect a turn away strategy that you are developing and applying? The core skill set. If you elect a turn port strategy. You're doing exactly the same, so if you think about it this way, it's a win win situation. Either strategy is legitimate out and what you want to avoid is the lose lose situation, which is why I don't want to turn away from it 'cause that just makes that's just an island suppression. I don't want to turn towards it because that's going to just exacerbate it an reinforce it. So now that you have nowhere to turn so anyway. If you happen to have a? A challenge of sensory challenge of any sort in general and specifically if you're struggling with an illness that are retreat or that kind of thing. These are some things you can keep in mind, and so when you're in the meditation. Hall try to be aware of your breathing that may come about through sleepiness or through some discomfort that you're going through. Open your eyes straighten your spine, etc, etc. Most of you know this story. But this is how I learned about. A lot of times you don't realize how. Disruptive you might be so. In my I'd been meditating for I don't know maybe a year or so and I went off to this, Soto Zen Temple called on Tai Chi. And so this is one of these so to set so you meditate facing the wall. I was already a shingle on monk at the time so that means that I was wearing ropes and. Underneath so you have sort of these robes that they're not very thick and then underneath that you have a key monale and it's a winter kimono, but almost not really designed for cold weather OK. It's great for the summer, the air. Just comes through. But I was really, really cold and I was sick. I got sick in the middle of the thing. And I was really, really miserable. Um. And you know, no heat in the zendo at all right, and it's like winter. So I guess I didn't realize it, but I was like. All day so like. The second day of the session, you're facing the wall right there. You can't see anything behind you and I go to sit down and back so much punches me in the nose from the back with a clinics stop and I couldn't see who it was. You only. Word that I can think of is. Vesuvius of rage all day, it just over and over again. How dare that mother * * 'cause, I didn't know who the mother * *** Almost certainly a Japanese monk, so now I've got all that going on and you can't do anything you just have to face the wall and face yourself. I mean, I got the message OK. Dude, you been an * even sniffing this whole time, so now OK. I won't sniff anymore, but. Oh my God, I was so angry and so uncomfortable and there's just nothing. You could do you just Soto Zen? It's 15 minutes? It's 10 minute walk 15 minutes at 10 minute walk? I think they did 14 hours of sitting each day. Something like that, and you're facing the wall talks know nothing it was hard. It was Scott has a it was like just sit. An there's nothing to do, but just face that inner hell and deal with it. Which is sort of awful but not nearly as awful as not dealing with it some of you have sweated with my friends Wolf and Lisa. The A Traditional Native American Sweat Lodge so anyway. It's Lisa that does the really hot sweats she's full blood Lakota Sioux. I don't know if that has anything to do with it, but the. And we were in a sweat once and she was saying. I know this path is hard. I know this path is hard. I know this path is hard, but there's one thing harder than this path. Harder than doing this path is not doing this path. And it is so true so you know, I could have been the person that. Was n't Miserable and sick and beat up in Japan. I could have been not that person that would have been so much harder. So much harder, I think I mentioned in the last retreat. Maybe I didn't but. When acquaintance of mine wrote a book called 10% happier Dan. Harris is on the Nightline right, I think ABC. Good Morning America or something like that right is like a Taco, but he's one of us. He famously had a panic attack on Camera all at some point in his career, which you can actually see it's on YouTube. It's like will be there forever right? That was his wake up call that he had something was radically wrong with his life. Major part of his recovery was to take on this practice mindfulness practice. But because he's in the position of being. You know prominent television personality. It's sort of cool for us, so he he wrote. This book called 10% happier at. He's got a whole program that goes with it actually is partnering up with one of my facilitators. Jeff Warren from Canada. They're on tour now in the US sort of bringing the message of mindfulness so cool that were that mainstream at this point. Um anyway, um. That the title of that book got be thinking about my own life. So you know 10% happier and I started to calculate in my mind did the like of a thought experiment. OK, at my current age. What would the picture be? If I hadn't made that decision at the age of 25 to buy hunker Crook Meditate. Every day of my life. What if I hadn't done that? What if I just been one of the million other things that I could have been. As a non meditator. So where would I be? Given who I was at 25. Extrapolating, where would I be and then where I know myself to be as the result of that decision. And. Objectively, I just had to say. It's it's not 10% happier it's 10 times happier. I mean, Object Ivli Easilly 10 times, happier or put the other way. I would be 110th as happy, which actually would be like pretty miserable so anyway, encourage you in that regard.","title":"MINDFULNESS with SICKNESS"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/music-meditation-on-cho-s-ipod/","text":"Gives an example when he started doing music meditation. First, People to your iPod alot. Cutest explain a little bit about what's happening on your iPod in Washington, referring them, too. Sure, music is very, very important in my life, I. When my house is empty. I fill it with music not always but you know when you have a household of People and then they leave. It's like I can listen to my own music now, so I found I love classical music an when he teaches the music meditation. He will use a technique of banishing are gone, he uses the rest and he uses the active states. I don't know if I were still using that term, but active states So what I did is I went through my classical music and I. Categorized it things that had for instance, the gone. You know, those moments when no sound. And so then you can note the gone. So I have about 4:00 or 5 pieces on my iPod that I've labeled meditation music gone and then I have four five pieces that are rest States and four five pieces for pure sound. Now somebody else might not. Find those pure sound, but to me, they fill me so that I can just. The The Sound. And I've actually loaned my iPod to many People and they've taken them off, so it's. Especially use it when I'm flying. Ours is going to say how are you using it primarily when I'm flying when I want to relax when I want pure sound and as be the music too.

Where are you Charlie? The really old days that he can remember in a few of you can remember so the really old days. I had a center in Korea town. And we did exactly the same thing that we were doing here and that was what was that that was 25 years ago. Longer. Yeah. So it's downtown LA and it's a long time ago and we used to do exactly what we do, we sit in the new year every single new year we would do that except it was. It was a lot more dramatic that we're going to get to experience. Because they hadn't yet out log the pistol. Aeros I think it's now illegal right to shoot all firearms in La. They still do it well, it wasn't even illegal. It wasn't even discouraged and we were right in the heart of downtown LA. And So what would happen is forgotten all about this. Charlie wrote that note, but Charlie and Judy remember anyone else go that far back to CMC. Not in this carpet Diafana Yeah, Robert so I would happen is we do are sad. And then you know you're in somebody and to some extent pretty mellow and you do you chant and it was the same things money but my home exactly the same except? What would happen during that half hour or so as you're approaching midnight is that the Sonic activity around would escalate just be like a few routes here there and then it's like. More and more and more and more until finally it's like the Battle of the bulge semi automatic weapons and I mean next store and I mean, you can see the flash and hear the sound of a semi automatic weapon. It's not just like a gun or something. It's like it's like crazy crazy sounds and we just like told contrast let's really, really. And you know it's like well like they say you know it's good for your practice so that was New Years. Yeah, back in the old days. Yeah, that was pretty crazy, too. We were that neighborhood is Korea tone. It's right where Korea town intersects with an El Salvadorian Barrio. I don't know what the ethnic thing is now. And then you have a whole chicano thing also going on so. And it's downtown so all of our retreats every single retreat all day. You could hear you get the mariachis from one side get the Koreans were very quiet. But there was also a lot of Vietnamese and so you get sort of the sino Vietnamese Peking opera kinds of sounds coming. There was always at least 1 fluid schizophrenic person acting out on the corner and you got the turf wars going on. They actually ended up blocking off our street with cement barriers eventually People couldn't even come in the LAPD because it was such a hot drug selling area and they were right on our front lawn literally on the front lawn and you could hear the turf wars People would get into fights. You be sitting and meditating and it's like you would actually hear People like slugging each other. That's the way that's the old that's what you're remembering right. Buddhist, saying, You used to remind yourself, yeah, I can. Guess what that was let me guess I probably said. If you want a small enlightenment. Go to the mountain. If you want a big enlightenment come to the city that is a Chinese proverb I heard from one of the Chinese Masters so. Yeah, so we used to meditate right in the middle of the city and so it was a very different. New Years experience here, sometimes we hear a little like array. If we're lucky we get it was pretty cool contrast. And also it was really good because you learn that you didn't have to have silence in order to have the practice. You know that's the beauty of the mindfulness. You could just recycle the reactions and so that's what we used to do it. We've got a little bit difficult was lot of People got their cars broken into. You know, usually I'd have to counsel someone after retreat that deal with. Calling the cops and that was those are the crazy days. Things are a lot more mellow now, so I guess we can appreciate that.","title":"New Year's Eve in The Old Days ~ with Shinzen Young"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/organizing-your-practice-shinzen-young/","text":"I had to do the theme last yesterday right everybody was scheduled to be the modality blast. Is that right? But we were * * Amanda schedule, so that we all get a chance for the modality blast. Underpaid. You're my fee schedule. TS Eliot. Uh. Costing nothing less than everything and all shall be well OK so. Today I wanted to talk about organizing your practice so it's a little bit of a lecture thing to start with particularly there. A number of you that are first timers that will be leaving today. So I wanted to get this. This conceptual piece clear so the way I think about organizing ones practice. Symbolically. I think of two cycles, Delta cycle and maybe an upsilon cycle of life cycle. So this is day today. And this is year to year, you can imagine that these are actually cycles or going around. Uh. If you can establish these cycles, you have a very high probability of success with your practice. So the day-to-day cycle is each day, try to do some formal practice and the bottom of this. Pyramid. Stands for formal projects. Um. Here's how I can I'm going to be very precise in my definitions. So here's how I define formal practice formal practice means that you have a a set technique or a set sequence of techniques and you implement that and that's where you're a majority of your resources are going to maintain that technique for sequencing. Techniques for a period of time that's formal practice. By way of contrast this. Top Top of the pyramid here that stands for what I call practice in life. Often People will do a period of formal practice in the morning. Some People do morning and evening. It's good if you could do formal practice. Most days and it's good if you can do it at the same time, same place if that's possible but if that's not possible if it has to be a different time a different place OK if it's not most days. That's OK, but I deal that the standard that most People do is. I in the morning because that sets up the whole day to be optimally to be optimal for practicing Life, which will describe in a moment. So, in order to be able to speak with precision about the elements of one's practice. So we'll use this defined terminology formal practice for example, if you were doing, noting technique that involve mental labeling during a period of formal practice there would be unbroken labeling and you be implementing that. Now there's two ways to do formal practice practice in stillness where the body is essentially not moving or not moving much seated stabbing lying down that kind of thing and practice in motion where the body is moved. And so I distinguish when I say practice in motion it needs formal practice. As opposed to practice in life. OK, which we'll talk about in a moment so this is how I use the terms. I encourage People to definitely do formal practice each day if possible, or most days if possible include both some practice and stillness at some practice in motion or at least occasionally have formal practice in motion. Why? Because we want to have that will make it easier to have carryover into practice in life So what is practice in life? What we're doing right now? Is practically an example of practice in life? Some of you are listening to the content of what I'm saying at allocating resources that way. But probably some of you every once in awhile aren't going back into a technique, maybe for a few seconds here or a minute there and then you sort of like coming back. Or maybe some of you are mostly just doing a technique now because they've heard it a million times. I know exactly what he's going to say, but don't be sure, I might surprise you. So you're going in and out of formal technique or a technique that's practice in life so. Will talk about what techniques in a moment but first we're going to talk about this dicyclic rhythms. So. I would encourage you at least if pot if you're committed to this practice, which pretty sure if we put in this room is pretty committed to this practice try to do at least at least a half dozen times a day. Have a little micro head where you go into a technique 30 seconds. Here, 3 minutes area, waiting in line your walk walking to the washroom. You're having a vacuous conversation with a coworker had a meeting. Be engaged, but you wanna look like you're engaged will see out here. God is really. So you're implementing a technique, but then it's like they call your name at the meeting OK now. I'm back to business, so back and forth, but at least a half dozen times each day. You really do. The practice and I call those surgical strikes, peppering the data may not be for very long and when do you do it, you do it? When you don't need all your CPU resources to deal with life? But what do you do with life you just deal with life that's OK, you allocate your resources to what you need to do, but during the day there's a rhythm of you know, maybe to allocate resources to take care of business versus leading that less and when you need that less go back to a well defined mindfulness technique 30 seconds here 3 minutes there what happened. The combination of the peppering of the day with the surgical strikes. Plus attitude. Attitude is important for practice in life. At what is the attitude? The attitude to take. When you complete the basis here, though your morning practice. Assuming you do it. That way you want to walk into the day with an attitude. And if possible, and what that attitude is. Is that this whole day? Is a monastery? A place where I'm going to apply an hold my skills that you just think of your human asta size your day conceptual. So we don't live where householders. We don't live in actual monasteries, but you could think of your day as a monastery. And thinking of your day that way. First of all. Makes everyday meaningful. Everyday is meaningful either. It's meaningful because great stuff happened or maybe not great stuff happen. But it was a vague of productive training. Uh so. This is a Chinese phrase Urschel hour every day is a good day OK. It says then expression. And that's what it means there's another one, which I won't write in Chinese. One said Master said. The average person is used, 24 hours a day. The person of Zen uses 24 hours a day so. OK so with armed with that attitude. And peppering the day. This woman *** to size the bulk of your day and then you have your formal practice feeling. Um. There is an option. And something you could do as a kind of Adam to practice in stillness. A structure. That will vastly vastly increase your ability to maintain mindfulness in daily life. And there's an add-on that you can do to practice in motion. Which will have the same effect? Home. One of the most common. Laments. That I hear. Is well I come to retreats and I can get into all this great stuff but then I when I go back to daily life, I can't maintain it. Well, first of all. We have to accept it to a certain extent that is true. Are you come to retreats to get to a new level. You may not be able to maintain exactly the peaks that you reach other retreats, but you don't want it to just go back to square one OK, you want it to be some sort of plateau and then your next retreat leads you to some sort of plateau. Keep this up for. However, many years you live there's going to be probably an exponential envelope to that. Sort of stepwise growth curve in general retreats tend to take us to a new level. But we don't want that to be a peak experience. We want to maintain that. And we we wanted maintain that not only in terms of our experience, informal practice. But we actually want to elevate the base level of mindfulness in daily life. Remember, the long term effect of this practice is to elevate the base level of mindfulness in daily life there. Recall I define your base level of mindfulness to be problem. Clear concentrated in Economus, You Are? What you're not trying to be that way. Intentional. That's the base level. We want to reset that base level over and over and over again. So there's a special version of practicing stillness that you could do that will tend to elevate the base level of mindfulness when you're not trying to be mindful just what should happen daily like that there's something you can do here. So I've already actually describe them. I do it every retreat. Now I'm going to do it again. Often it might help currency it visually so if you come to me and you say, I am not satisfied with my base level of mindfulness in daily life. Just how I am? When I'm not trying to be if you come to me, I will ask you did, you try this? And have you tried this? If you say no I'm just going to say. Try it and then come back to me. So what is this here I wrote EP OK and I wrote MC this is slightly new full cabul airy. I've used other words, other phrases previously so for today. What we're going to call the add on to practice and stillness actually well, yeah, where the add on to practice it stillness. I'm gonna call it trigger practice OK, we those of you that. I've been to previous retreats or donate our own practice. I've talked about media practice while trigger practice is a generalization of media practice and motion challenge challenge sequence in motion. You've heard me talk about before let me explain So what is? And I talked about this at this retreat, but let's just say it again for the sake of systematic completeness. So. Often, when we do practice in stillness were just sitting there on. Not a whole lot comes up OK, sometimes things come up depending on the rhythm of life and our own subconscious unwinding, but lot of times, not a lot comes up. But as soon as you're popping up in the world as soon as you turn on the 6:00 o'clock news as soon as you negotiate the freeway or the workplace or the family or whatever stuff coming up. So. I. I encourage People to work smart. I remember years ago hearing an interview by Japanese baseball player who was playing in the US and they asked him to. Contrast the difference between baseball in Japan versus baseball. the United States and he said. the Americans are stronger, but I think we Japanese play smarter. Well, I would like to reverse. I'd like to turn the tables on that OK, the way People get enlightenment in Japan in a Zen Temple. Hey this is Samurai Boot Camp This is brute force. This is brute force training. Uh it's it's anti intellectual. It's it's no mind. It's just a body beaten into submission through exhaustion and etc, etc, etc until you just. Give up and go into the no self so it. It's strong it's a lot stronger than what? You are I are willing to do OK. Let's work smarter. So how do you work smart you train yourself systematically? What comes up in the day? Joy interest comes up that range terror grief in the extreme case are irritation nervousness. You know pour me what have you stuff comes up? But it's stillness. You see what we're doing practicing stillness is the ideal place to Trey. It's analogous to the empty empty parking lot, where you gotta learn how to drive but there's no pressure something but then once daily life. Hey that's LA Freeway at rush hour in the smog with People shooting at chillers. So, but the Packers is the empty parking lot. Doesn't have typically the full range of stuff you need to deal with and I don't just mean negative stuff, I mean, the full range of Liberty. So you can. Upon occasion do practicing stillness where you are exposing yourself to sound sites or physical sensation or some combination thereof that is likely to trigger the full range of things you want to deal with. So you can sit there, you can close your eyes, you got the remote control and can listen to whatever you want to listen to all the sons of the world are there and in deep when you're in a deep sitting I mean just try it OK, you say you never get images OK. I never get mental images? Well, listen to a real dramatic movie with your eyes closed OK, you'll see image space. Goes nuts trying to forgive you an impression of what's going on in that action movie OK, you never get emotional sensations during during a formal practice OK close your eyes go really, really deep totally go into restful states, then click on the 6:00 o'clock news and see what happens to your mind. Or turn on the politician that you most lower than fear. OK let's see what happens to your body I promise you it will be Olympics is that the big. Your big princier emotional right they've even you might have read on the Internet. They've done studies. Of and it doesn't matter what your political persuasion is whether you're lying liberal conservative conservative. When you are exposed to the to the opposite point of view, it is absolutely expansion and contraction. This area here, which is your higher executive function contracts that OK and your migdale and your hypothalamus. I mean, you're. Hippocampus all it because this whole emotional brain thing totally expands it activity. It doesn't matter what your political perspective is OK your listening with your emotional body. Uh. And what's interesting I find it, I'm not going to pursue this. This can of worms any further, but both sides try to use this data to prove that the other side is. You know irrational. OK, so OK so. You can do this kind of trigger practice of provocation and you could work with one or a combination of whatever kind of stimuli. You want to present yourself to an over a course of time you simply systematically train. Your yourself to have an automatic mindful response to every possible trigger that could come up in daily life. And when you do it. This way, informal practice you control the type the intensity. The duration and the timing. The frequency of the stimuli and this light weight lifting. You don't want to overburden yourself. You just work against an edge. You lifted appropriate amount of weight you get stronger and stronger and stronger and that strength. Ah is does not dissipate it's with you in daily life. That's media practice or trigger practice. Wolf rather than motion challenges you. I'd say that there's a technique that you'd like to do. And you can do it pretty good with your eyes closed seated well. Can you do it with your eyes open CD? Can you do it with your eyes open standing could you do it walking around in your room? Can you do it walking around outside can you do it walking around in the city? Can you do it while you wash the dishes? Can you do it while you prepare a meal? Can you do it while you prepare a meal you've never prepared before? OK can you do it while you're having a vacuous conversation with the neighbor over the back fence? Can you do it? When you're having a substantive conversation with someone? Maybe a significant other, you give yourself a challenge sequence like that, for any technique that you would like to learn. To master and that will tend to train smartly systematically to maintain or to have a high level of baseline mindfulness in daily life. So this is the day to day cycle. This is the Delta steps from day to day cycle where you establish you certainly some practicing stillness. But don't forget practice in motion and then you can do. Do not documented life concept. Then also longer by steps for the year they were recommended. No find what works for you. But at least try it, you know at least occasionally or if you don't need it. Then you don't need it. But like I say if if you come to me and say, I don't have enough carry over into daily life. I'm going to say exercise due diligence. I gave you some ideas. Let's work, smart, but no no particular recommended whatever you think. Practice in your example was like an outside to a remote control. How are you change him bring us something OK very good I called I called that evoking I have a different term for that and I think I gave a spiel about evoking right in the group process where you were you here OK. So yeah, I consider that to be yet another thing I don't make that as major as this because. Doing the evoking is at, I don't think it depends on the individual. I mean do what works for you right, but evoking still somewhat requires 2 hats. You gotta sort of bring this stuff up. And they just got him observant and even though you separate those tasks there still are 2 tests trailer practice is completely passive and really controllable and you would so it's yeah, much more control here. You can be much more passive. It just do technique and you have the part of the control is that you can choose exactly the type and intensity of stimulus. You want to work with so it gives you the possibility of essentially in a systematic way training yourself for everything. I remember I had this huge sudden sort of classic breakthrough very, very long time ago. And what I did the next day, I turn on the radio and I found the most disgusting program that I could it's called Anglo Israel. And what it is I still remember it's like some of you out there may be under the impression that Jesus was a Jew would God be bored as a Jew, Jesus was like you and I and then you try to prove. The up the inhabitants of England from the 6th century were in fact, the chosen People and that's super viable stalking. you and I the white People that live here. The Wasps in America, so and then I just this. Just totally bliss. Whereas before it windows, so you can find whatever. How to work with? OK, so. We could on Delta force what's the P. The P up Top. OK, so now I'm still walk cycle twice a year near the base of the year year year year is just keep this up for the use of your life keep the Delta up for the years of your life. Then. OK. Throughout the year at least once if possible, more. Do retreat retreat practice now you can. You can slice and dice your retreat practice anyway. You want, but you wanna get some retreat practice in. So you know, my hobby is math, etc, so in math. We often try to imagine something called the trivial case now when I say the trivial case that that's not a pejorative OK. It has a specific meaning. It's what is the simplest thing we can imagine that still has the characteristic of? Some structure OK, the group or a ring or a field or a vector space or you know, there are these structures? What's the simplest case? That's not so simple that it lacks that structure that's called the trivial case. So I asked myself what is the trivial case of retreat. What is the shortest simplest most convenient thing we could possibly do that's not just along set but actually sorta comes under the rubric of retreat. And I came up with the four hour. Micro retreats that are that make up the whole practice program and so it's like OK. It's a 4 hour period. It's structured in a certain way. There's preparation. But all the elements are there. There's kewene there's a little bit of talk is even a chance to talk 1 on one with the teacher wide window it. You could if you needed to there's guided practice of self work its unbroken continuity of practice for 4 hours. An and the delivery system is telephone as opposed to People have to travel expenses in the family. Well, you know it's it works, OK, we've we've never advertised it. But it's growing exponentially underwear. We started we had there about twice as large now without any advertising at all. And when we finally get it all together that will roll it out. When I get everything manualized and then we could probably. Thousands of People doing this, but in any of that, so no one can say that they can't do retreat practice if they speak English and have a telephone and access to a computer at least occasionally and we can tell the world probably if you cannot afford the token $20, then don't pay anything ever forever. Just get cheap long distance or you Skype, it will cost you anything and you can. Do retreats forever for nothing, and their liberation oriented retreats and not light OK so. To me that's the trivial case of retreat, so if you do 1 four hour retreat every single month. That sort of equivalent of 1/2 day retrievals for months of roughly. OK, well that's sorta adds up to a week retreat that would be a residential situation. This is bare minimum by the way bare minimum for formal practice day. Today's 10 minutes. There is Mike repeat and difference. Infinite if the ratio of of 10 to 0 is Infinity OK. There's an infinite difference. We doing doing 10 minutes each day at doing no minutes each day. And there's no one that said that could say, Oh my day is so busy. I don't have 10 minutes. If you're not doing the 10 minutes. It is not a time thing? What is it? It's a resistance thing and when you finally scour down into what the resistance is you will probably discover it's not that big a deal. 50% of the time the resistance is in the subtle agitation flavors that come up in daily life. That you're going to have to face, if you. Stopping time so. Hi. Usually that's all it is. The guy. OK so you could do that, but of course, if you could do one or 2 residential retreats. That's that's really good or maybe you do one day retreats. Etc etc. But try to get some. Sustained practice where you're doing, you're doing, it for more than an hour and more than 2 hours. So periodic retreat. And then periodic contact with at least 1 teacher. Who is competent to sort of give you big picture guidance on your practice touch base typically it's at the retreat that that contact comes 'cause you have an interview on line even as I say with the home practice program. People call me. They only get 10 minutes. But you know at least they can touch base on their practice and I can ask them a few quick questions and so forth. So if you establish. These 2 cycles. You have a very high probability of being a very happy camper. Now that's sort of the. The big picture of structure. Now we need to look at the more micro picture of stuff that's the macro structure. What's the micro structure and the micro structure was OK? What techniques are you practicing? Else move all her would have to wash this board. Stay. Like a bad impression so. Up. Ann. The way you could assuming you want to. Use the basic plan for the system. Then you sort of think of this graph. So 3 by 4:00. Red. And then I'm here you've got a another thing. Has 6 boxes? Actually, last point over here and it will follow the food last. Here. Inside. Do nothing. And here is the possible themes for nurture positive. Positive affect positive behavior positive cognition, ideal, which is the archetype of entire thing situations laws of attraction manifestation and other unpaid house, ABC ISO. So you can think of organizing what you do. In terms of making choices. From these from from this. This array. So. There's 3 basic possibilities. One is For a certain period of time. A week, a month your whole life, whatever you just do one or maybe 2. Ah. Techniques is sort of monolithic OK, it's just like. OK, this is a catalog and I'm going to, I'm going to buy this. For maybe I will buy this whole wrong. This whole column working solo. Or maybe I'm gonna buy this, or this OK, so it's sort of like. One or 2 things and that's what you do and so there's no choice is at least for a certain period of time, like I say a week, a month could hear your whole life. How are you wanna do? That's the simplest and because this grid does contain not all but a significant percentage of every fundamentally distinct strategy for meditation worldwide. Organize into a unified framework of sorts. It's basically allows you to pick from the whole world as to what you'd like to do so. There's nothing wrong with keeping it simple, maybe you want to just. Explore. Your body OK, so you're gonna you're going to play this role broad float inside this room OK. And that's all you want to do you just want to penetrate the body in terms of the see it by field infield outfield as fuel flow and their vengeance. And that's all you do so. One choice play this world and that's what you do. Or maybe 2 choices. I'm going to play this row and then I'm going to do the loving kindness afterwards, so nurture positive that thing so that that keeps things. Simple is nothing wrong if that appeals to you with keeping things simple. The other possibility is for a period of time week amount the year of your whole life you create. Are a set sequence? Either it's one that you create yourself. Or it's one of the standard ones that I tend to guide people in. And that's what you do you go through that secret so it's like? It's like. A cycle exercise equipment or a yoga, then and you can actually repeat the sequence that could be very interesting, then cycle through it, you can go from more than once if you want. The common sequences that I give People. Uh. Are the? The modality sequence where we broad float dog flowed. Pride flowed and really broad flowed then just not gone. And then choose one. Then there's the theme sequence and play that calls paying broad float this column this one this one. So, in outlast flow, then you gotta do nothing. They do go here and of course, this chart. If you sort of look at it this way. Is that cycle it actually is a picture of the theme cycle? You can also do like a mini blast. With regards to one of the columns and rows for example, let's say you really see, there's actually 4 techniques represented by this column. There's each of these individual and then there's play the whole comp so this is the focus in family of Tech. So you could play the whole column broadleaf load then. Scroll through 5 minutes here 5 minutes. Here, 5 minutes hearsay and then brought float again. So what have you done you get the big picture and he going for close up. Now I get back to the establishing shot but when he come back to the establishing shot because you've done. All this close-up work. Things are likely to be more mindful. Maybe more pleasant more fluid etc. So you can do like a mini blast for a column you can do the same thing for a row. You can. Focus on C in general and then touch base with in out CNC out see rusty flow and go back to the whole thing. Maybe you want to create that time set sequence. So you could do feed blast with ality blouse. You can do a mini blast for any other rows or columns or create your own personalized workout. Now let's say that you want to incorporate some things from this system. But you also want to do other things that aren't in this system. Well, actually if you came to me and we discussed at this probably a pretty good probability that the other thing you want to do. That's not in the system actually is in this system because you just haven't thought through all the subtleties of all the options. Because half the time when People come to me and say, well. This isn't in the system. I like to do it, I said, Well, you remember that option and that option where you put those 2 together and actually it's in the system but let's say it's not. Um. Everything that's not in some way covered by this taxonomy. I called special exercises and special exercises. I've got my own spin special exercises OK that aren't that I might give you from time to time, so absolutely do special exercises. You can mix and match and slice and dice. This paradigm with anything else. You want from practice because to be a longer. So I see the commonality anything you're going to do in some way or another. He's going to develop some aspect of CC in an from that perspective totally compatible with the basic mindfulness system. So you can if you might want to create some sort of sequence where you mix other stuff in great. Ah so. However, now the advantage to set sequences, where you. You exercise a lot of Psycho spiritual muscle groups, the disadvantage is more complicated than just doing the same thing everyday keep it simple. The greatest complexity comes when you boot loop and branch. So these are terms from. Computer programming and so forth. Now this is what I do in my practice, but that doesn't mean it's what you need to do what? Is you know works for one person doesn't necessarily at all work for another person? So. Although you might think of it as a decision tree that is actually not mathematically a tree. It's actually a cyclic graph. OK, because you can loop as well as branch. So. You sit down and you determine a starting place where am I going to start. Donuts. So that's technique one. Whatever that is. Nose larger. So. At some point. You sort of say OK well, what am I gonna do now. And it might be. Then, at that point. You say, well, I'm going to just keep on doing this 'cause it's working. Maybe that's all you do that. But maybe at this point, you say, Well, you know Watt? This window. Or this wall came up. And I would like to switch to this. I'm gonna branch to this other. Because that's going to take care. Of. This that's going to optimize my utilizing the window of opportunity. Or it's going to be an efficient way to deal with the wall that's. As at advantage over what I was doing. And then maybe you just. Keep on looping back to that. Or maybe at some point you say OK undealt with the wall. Now let's go back to Earth. Or maybe you dealt with the wall and it turned into a window? Which. Says. Let's do technique 3. Uh. Then whatever happens, happens at some point, it's time to end up. I'm so maybe you have up here or maybe. There is a certain. TE a certain technique that you like to end with maybe it's nurture positive. And who knows maybe there's a certain. Ah. TB technique you always begin with that's optional. And then in between you Groupon Brouch. Based on interest opportunity necessity, but not driven by craving aversion unconsciousness and most importantly of all about making a big deal about these decisions, everybody follow that logic. You've heard it before. Many times. So that's grouping attraction. Um. These are cycles, OK, these are branch points. So that really complex. But for some People that's interesting optimal so you could do that, if you wish. So you decide whether you want to. What do you wanna have one ball OK or whether you wanna have a sequence of balls? That perhaps he was P. Well, you do repeat if you do it, the next day, but maybe repeat during the same session. So maybe 1 or 2 balls. Our sequence of some sort or you're going to have an algorithm that moves and branches in in complicated ways. In terms of the three ways that you can use. Are the grid to organize your practice?","title":"Organizing Your Practice ~ SHINZEN YOUNG"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/our-subjective-experience-explained-by-shinzen-young/","text":"Mental images. Rentals are. Emotional body sensation. So. In general if you look from the side mental images tend to be sort of centered here. But they can be around your surroundings and they can also be back where your body is but memory plan fantasy tends to sort of be often in front talk tends to be posterior and up. And then the emotional body is primarily download the body is so very, very roughly speaking. You've got a triangle like this. It's an oversimplification, but it's a way of thinking about it. This is the center of it in space, but it is basically broad can be quite why act? So emotional body space is just the space of your body. Some People have emotional centers places in the body where pleasant or unpleasant emotional sensations would likely be most prominent some People don't have emotional sent. If you have emotional centers that position them bring yourself to your emotional body means somewhere to strongly in those centers in some awareness peripherally older model body if you don't have emotional centers, then just awareness in your power bill in general is to be in emotional body space daughter spaces typically ill defined, but most People sort of pointed ears there had this area cephalic. So abstractly and in the over simplified schematic view we can think of. In in Space Park Space Emotionalize. Are descriptive word for visual thing? Is mental image but our label is see in? Are descriptive word for auditory thinking? Is mental talk but our label is here? Ann are descriptive word for emotional body sensation is emotional bodies in. However, that label is field. Yeah. Um. This. So when I memorized think about this system. Well, I sort of get this image of the triangle. And I also get the phrase. That this system is reactive. Prolactin interactive and occasionally in Act. Um. If you get this you will have such a handle on life. Such a handle on. Um because every heaven and hell that you will experience between now and the moment, You Die. Will somehow involve the four things that I just mentioned? Within this system. It's reactivity, it's proactivity its interactivity and its occasional enact. So let's see what that means. Reactive means if you have external sounds external sites and physical body sensation. It could trigger 1, two or all 3 things at the same time. So it reacts to the physical sense. Producing Watt well if that reaction is unconscious and solidified it produces the sense that there is a self that here's. CS and is physically compact. So if you're in pain. And this system is reacting to the pain judging it awfulizing it. With an having living reactions, such as fear tear irritation. Helplessness and so forth. So that's the self arrived that's this system reacting to a physical contact with physical world. So as a reactive system. When it activates and it's not experienced with concentration clarity and equanimity. It will convince you that you have a limited self that is CA hearing in a physical world. Uh. So on the other hand, we're not trying to get rid of this activity is that it can activate to the Mass. But as long as there is clarity concentration and equanimity In other words, as long as you have incomplete experience or so and by the way equanimity is none other than total self. Love and Toning Self acceptance. In this regard. So if it reacts. And you experience it fully that you love it to death is so active that it's no longer there is a thing so that it is. OK, so. So that's the reactive system. Every single time you're convinced there's someone inside of you, it's a self experiencing another that is Alien and it. At some soda level, the system is recast reacting to the physical world. It may be subliminally above the threshold awareness and our job is to clarify it and I block and I've loved it. Uh that's the reactive. Proactive now we've noticed this, it's called monkey mind. When it's not reacting to the outside world, it starts spinning memory clan fantasy problem solving. Fantasies basically 2 kinds fantasies that you run to scare you and fantasies that you run to entertain you. Uh when there's nothing else, going on in neuroscience. This is well known it's called the default network default, meaning it's what People fall back on when you don't ask them to attend to something in an experiment. They think they would tell People OK now just rest now OK. We're having you like watch that target that visual target. Now do nothing just rest and then they discovered there, not resting this all this distinctive activation billing. By way of default. So what's happening is monkey monkey? Is memory playing fantasy problem solving on something etc? So I called that the proactive system meaning that this system will just go off on its own and spin memory plan. Fancy convincing you that there's a past convincing you that there's a future on convincing you of many, many things. So that's the proactive side of this system once again. We're not trying to get rid of that. We're trying to have a complete experience. Then the system is interact. That means a mental image could trigger an emotional body cell. Apple Todd could trigger an emotional policy. Emotional body sensation could build until you just have to make a comment about it or or have a picture of a mental image. You could trigger a comment a mental talk good make a picture to accompany it. So the arrows point both ways. This is the interactivity of the system and once you become familiar with this system. You can start to track how this will trigger this and then this will be for this that sell for exactly so that's the interactivity. Uh and becoming clear about this is knowing yourself at a sensory level at a system. System theoretic level this is this is the system theoretic paradigm for thoughts and emotions. Uh. Then the last phrase is occasionally inactive. Actually, more than you might imagine for brief moments the system turns off hundreds and hundreds of times during the day. When you just here just see just. Experience physical touch for just a second this system actually evaporates. But People usually don't notice. So it doesn't help them, they don't realize that they sell wings in and out of existence during the day. So when it goes inactive we happening have uh no sub state, but unless you consciously experience it, it will be liberated. So we want you to be able to notice when it's active. So that's the subjective system and that's what we're going to do. Um. We're gonna work I will show you how to bring individually and collective. So. If we draw column. And we have, we're going to use in as an abbreviation for inner arises. Will you see to refer to the visual experience. It's a verb of visual perception here is the verb of auditory perception. Field is the verb form somatic perception so CN for mental images here in for metal dog feel them for emotional body sensation. We can work individually and then we could broadly float will call this focus in. Within the whole system. So let me say that a lot most People have quite a bit of here in. That's what we're going to start. Um soda note here in each time the. Mental talk arises when the mental talk comes to an end gone. That's you period at the end of the sentence. And then if there is no mental talk your rents now sometimes People find that by placing attention in talk space. It's sort of like turns off the map. That's not suppression. It just is it just happens that way. So you'll hear rest. You'll listen to that. Restful state otherwise here in column. Some People find that after the gone. That'll be a restful state. Some People find that there's immediately into a rising of the next word or phrase are set. So let's hearing on your rest that's how we could work individually with face this is actually pretty straightforward. Mental images and emotional body sensations require a bit of. Clarification. 1st and foremost if you're new to practice. You may not have many mental images. Um. And that's not a problem you just. May not have many of them. So we're going to have you focus on the dark bright in front of behind your closed eyes? Which is recall is see rest? Focus on that, if you don't have any mental images. But if you do have mental images remote that that as CDM if all or even part of the mental image drops away or drops off, then comma banishing all in finding information. If you don't have many mental images and find you'll just be serious Seacrest until 8:00 occur. Remember, however, that if you have memory plan or fantasy you probably are seeing the memory scene. You probably seen the fantasy and so forth, we don't call it imagination for nothing. Um. But it may be very vague and fleeting just a ghostly impression. That's CNN. People often think that our mental images, it must be clear like a photograph or like looking at a physical object only for some People the great majority People a mental images are these vague wispy diaphanous. Impressions of form. That disappeared very quickly. And that's that's it. That's the image remember also that if you are aware that you're in any particular place. If you're convinced you're in a room with People at a certain location, you probably get some Bay image of your surroundings that see. And when you have body sensations, you probably get a sense of your overall body in Europe, it, but your appearance In addition to the sensations in the body. There's the image of the body once again often rather vague and feel defined that see him also. So. That's that. Field in Is there's a lot to be said about? So. At any given instant. Somewhere in consciousness, you may experience. Emotion. The Alternative is at any given instant you're not experiencing any emotion. If you're not sure assume you're not experiencing any. OK, so at any given instant you may expect to have an experience of emotion. Um that emotion, maybe well defined qualitatively orgil define quality. It may be intense or it may be so quite where that emotion is occuring maybe well defined or it may be able to. However, at any given instant you either have an emotional experience or you don't and if you're not sure assume you know. If you are having an emotional experience. It is possible that part of that emotional experience will involve bodies in. A change in your father. If so are label for that body sensation is field again. It is possible that you have an experience that you'll say is emotional, but it's mental only and does not affect the body. In which case there is no emotional sensation in the body emotion is completely. Not all that could happen. In that case when we work with this. Ann. You're having a mental emotion, but there's nothing the same types of guarding your bot whatever may be happening in your mind your body is emotionally recipe. So we call that field last. So. If you go to your body and try to figure out which sensations are physical and which are emotional. You may be able to do that, but you probably won't, it will probably just be crazy. To try to figure that. So it depends on the individual but the way that I set up this category Theo PM. Is not? Specifically, I'm asking you to go to the body and figure out what's physical and origin once emotional. If you can do that fine but most People that study. And it doesn't compute. However, here's something anybody. At any given instant you ask yourself. And my experience in motion. Summer. Well defined bill define OK my experiencing emotion. The answer is yes. Is any part of that experience? Does any part of that experience in pop projects? Yeah, I'm certainly there be yesterday. If you're not sure the answer is melt. If the answer is yes that's appealing. And that's what to focus on the answer is no then when we're doing this technique your body is emotionally neutral. And that is a flavor of rest. There are basically 3 flavors of rest that could come up in the body physical relaxation, emotional neutrality and the sense that there are parts of the body that hunt there or that your body is the CPU. Those are the 3:00 basic flavors of field rest. When we do this, if there is no emotion in your body that field. It is quite common for People to when they try it when they do see in that they mostly just sequence. It is quite common and People do feel them, but they mostly just feel less In other words, cities don't activate this usually act. But sometimes it doesn't even. Now are you going to make it a problem that there's nothing but rest within this system. Please don't someday it will activate my promise. Come now. So I'm a common complaint is. Well, when I do formal practice and I try to work with my subjective experience. It's all rest. I this system doesn't activate. It goes inactive during formal practice or or this part might be active. But these other two parts aren't and during form practice, I can never get the field or the the feeling of the CN dog. So I have a button in daily life. Of course, it is going, but I don't have the wonderful situation of being informal practice to work with it. So what should I do so. Watt is my standard recommendation for this situation do lovely Wifey. Yeah, or In other words of course, they do nothing is OK, you could just accept the fact that nothing is happening, but let's say that you want to be in a formal practice situation and he wanted to be able to add middle activate the control the direction and intensity of the subjective reactive system, which would be a way of working smart. Uh a way of training where you're in control, so that when the reactive system gets activated in daily life who sort of trained yourself in ideal situations well, what I recommend is that you expose yourself to emotive sounds or emotive sites that activate the system. Sound is the best 'cause you can do it with your eyes close. It's easy to detect the images, so I usually recommend something like. Flipping around the TV and then getting things that activate pleasant or unpleasant. Feelin would be amazed. How many images. You have if you listen to the soundtrack of a movie. Your mind would just immediately try to see what's going on OK and so it activates the whole system. And that way you train yourself to work with the system and you can have the best of both worlds because you're in a formal practice situation and you're in control of the type duration and intensity of the stimulus for this system so. Uh. If you If you come to me and say, I'm not getting a carryover into life. I'm going to ask you well have you tried media practice have you tried training? 4 lives impacts. In stillness. I I call that working smart, so at the retreat, if not much activates Wendy's for this that's fine. We'll just do the rest of nothing but there are ways to intentionally activate it and not necessarily a negative directions, either just all sorts of interesting things can be done so. That's the subjective system. Yes, well 20Q. Four licitation can. We imagine ourselves in both situations, then that's just don't get that. The intentional as a general principle intentionally controlling the system is only something we do is. Focus on positive which will be starting in the afternoon. However, I sent as a general principle. People will sometimes asked well. Can I activate it by sort of thinking about a certain something I would say it's OK to do that? Occasionally, I wouldn't make that the centerpiece of his practice. Yes, in terms of field and they're talking about the emotional body and what's the distribution between a headache and the emotional body or is that part of the emotional Bobby Orr back pain, OK good. That's a good question. The The way you know it's an emotional body sensation is by following that little procedure that I just. Baby OK. In other words. If you You ask yourself, Li students in an emotion. OK. And then you go to the body and see if any, part of that's in the body. That if In other words, you didn't have any motion then an emotional rise. What changed in the body that's the emotional balance sensor? The places to look our reaction. If there's a sound. And you're smiling. If there's a sound in the environment and you're irritated by the sound and it's not just mental comment about it, but you actually like having irritation of the body that's emotion in the body. In general. I I will give you a list of. A dozen or so common situations where there is likely to be emotional sensation in your body. Anger when you experience a hanger? Where do you usually experience it in the bottom? Are you asking me? Yeah. OK, good so that's an emotional bond. Feel. That's an emotional life. Send. Bats and emotional bodies. Sure. Fancy machine of lattice. Um. Enthusiasm interest. Not sure OK shame embarrassment. OK. You got all of those are emotional values and stay. Physical pain, no that's a physical body. However, if it causes an emotional reaction that. That that could happen so? How do you work with that let's say my start to sit and all I mean? I hang in with some physical pain. I just want to sit and then I have emotional reaction to physical pain. It's not something I. Bring up it's not something that sort so it's it. I'm not making any sense are you asking how to work with the pain or whether you most of our reaction to it, OK, so In other words. Let's say that you're doing the field intending OK, so you are the instruction is if you have what seems to be emotional body sensation you focus on. So now the pain what flavors of emotion does the pain causing. Feel. Well, you're very precise so now you're going to be aware of the pain is one thing. And the fear reactions in the pain is another thing. You're going to note that as field him. A fear reaction that sensation. Then, what is noting means acknowledge and then focus on that sensation as you focus on that sensation he will attempt to accept that sensation. This vast civilization. Yeah, the fear sensation. The react member. I said reactive so you're looking for the body reacting to the bottom in this particular case. And then what do you do with it just? Try to make friends with it as best you can now that's only one way to focus of course, you might want to focus on the mental images triggered by the pain or the mental Top treatment. I think it also might want to focus on the game itself or you might wanna focus away from pain onto arrested. All of these are options. Just be clear, which one you're doing. And then the data answer your questions sufficiently OK excellent. Yes, I just wanna clarify if we were working with this procedure and we were having a lot of resting and see in a lot of resting. Field in we would not be noting that because we're not focusing on the rest where he is actually 4 procedures on the board, so let's be clear what we're talking about. This is one option. This is another option. This is another option. This is another option that's great OK. So if you're doing this, the instruction says if you don't have any activation note the corresponding recipe. But if you do have an activation then not the app activation. Of course, if you did, it for awhile that there wasn't any activation that you might want to switch technique because essentially not just melting recipes. Same thing for here, the instruction set is crystal clear as long as you're doing this procedure, which could be for 2 minutes or 2 years, however long you want to be doing it. If there's mental Top urine when it disappears golf if there's no mental talk here rest. And you just do that and then if it doesn't seem productive. You do something else. Crystal clear answers yes if you want if you're in the rest day. If you want to activate more active state. You recommend like a team. You know like turn on the TV or female? Can you use your image I mean? Can you pretend you're in a traffic jam and actually that question was just asked a few minutes ago but I'll answer it again as in general. The. Ah, you are passive with regards to these things OK, you just let them when you do this technique. So you are waiting for activation to occur if it doesn't occur then you just note the corresponding vessel. Um. However, if you find them. This system hardly activates when you do practice in stillness and you want to do something to sort of stimulate it so that you can observe it and practice up with it, then I recommend media practice. You listen to the TV or something like that. You get things turn up. But that would just be a sort of special thing that you would do to help train your skills. Is that clear? As far as intentionally bringing something up. In order to have something to focus on with this that was asked over here. I said it's OK to do that occasionally but it's not it's not really the the waiting today. OK. Yes. Sorry I had a brain last? What does in at the Top stand foreigner activation so this is this is this is easier here in Dylan focusing focusing? Focus as it stands now. When something is prefixed by focusing means broadly float with him that theme or that sensory modality. Otherwise, we see the specified box again.

Those are my threatened amas by 3:00 utterances. Now. I'm going to put them all together in one diagram. And that diagram Furthermore is going to show you how to store and retrieve. Everything I have ever taught you in Essence. To put it on one page. So that's a lot of information and a lot of relationships between information. So I'm going to give you information. Info and the info is about mindfulness. Info. Some of the info is basic. The basic info answers. 5 questions. What is mindfulness? You already know right. Why practice wine fullness? You already know I showed you. At least 1 Formulation How do you develop mindfulness? We just covered that too OK that was the first utterance now wasn't it right. What what is mine from us I showed you the 3 sides etc etc? Then there's the question of where is mindfulness? And there is the question of? When is web? When did mindfulness developed well the when of mindfulness it's still developing and that's the utterance? I just made with the shamanism meditation. Historical is the pre history. The history, the present and possible future so that's the wind, you already know that. The where you also know it's the human condition, so you already know the answers. To these 5 basic questions? What is it concentration clarity equanimity wide practice it. Or sides of human happiness? How do you practice it? Give me techniques you need day-to-day practice here to your practice? Try to make it fun. When did it develop? Well, it's still developing and where is it applied it it's applied to the human condition? And. So that's the bait sort of the basic information. And then some of the information, I'm going to give you. Is? Details. Detailed information. Details about The Watt. For each of concentration clarity and equanimity. The details are. What it is what it isn't? An example from your life learning how to evoke examples from other peoples lives. There's a superficial view and a deep view for for each of the skills and you've heard me talk about that. If not at this retreat other retreats. So we've got detail about the Watt. The detail about the why we talked about last night. Here are the basic formula. As you'll recall. Is? Mindful awareness. Leads to 6 factors. That constitute Let's just say it's for you. This is the happy pointing to you. On. There's 6 things that are thought of as being whoops. Let's do it surface 1st. Surface or ordinary human happiness. And remember it was get pleasure in the body avoid discomfort in the body. Get various answers in the mind avoid don't know mind. In the mind get situations that you want. And avoid situations that you don't want OK. This ordinary happiness plus deep happiness. For yourself. Deep happiness you remember the difference, OK here, you want fulfillment. Here you want to you want to elevate fulfillment you want to avoid suffering. You want to get the answer. And you want to be able to experience don't know mind. As an OK thing. And then here instead of situations its behavior. You want to manage. I love cause and effect positive behavior cut down on negative object to behavior those of the object effectors ease of the sensors factors. This. Leads to a motivation. To help other People and I mentioned why that is, and what form that takes so this is a love of the human condition. What I drew there? It was a heart and this is the Chinese character for humanity. This is bodhichitta. This leads to bodhicitta in the Buddhist context. Which then leads you? To spread surface and deep happiness to others. And all of this, this plus this. And this. Equals total human happiness. It's this plus this it's not just. Of learning how to get fulfillment. It's also getting pleasure is not just avoiding suffering. It's also avoiding discomfort is not just getting enlightenment answers. It's getting this too. These together the situations you want. So this plus this leading to this. Leading to this. You'll have to have happy in every way. So that's details about happiness. Then there's you already know all the details about. The practice because it's on the game boards that we've been going over and over and over. That's where the details on that are so I said, Do you have basic information? You'd have detailed information. You're going to also have. Deep information there's certain deeper things. Specifically, about the how you remember that, we talked about the deep game of mindfulness. The interplay of work with the parts work with the whole make make separate make distinctions make unifications active stance versus passive stance. Mutual complementarity of self and no self. That's sort of the deep game of how. And then there's the deep where. We talked about this, I won't go into the details but the forces that mold. Are sensory experience? Uh. This surface forces of Inter activation versus outer that expensive contractive poll. The mundane expansion and contraction and then the deep pure spirit. Spatial spread and collapse or in the paradigm of early Buddhism. The spontaneous rising and simultaneous passing when viewed from a temporal paradigm. These are the deep view of where. That's our sensory experience that's the board in between this of time space and our sensory experience that inhabits it. So that's a deep perspective. I'm going to give you deep information and then I'm going to give you broad information just for the fun of it. A broad context of the whole universe. Gotta look at where these themes sort of fit in with what's known about. The natural world, broad. So. These are the kinds of information, I'm going to give you so we need a a nice storage bin for this. Hopefully one that sort of looks pretty but also is intuitive so you'll know where information is. So. We're going to have a basic box. Uh now let's not call it that let's call it the center square. And that a place in Boston. Center Square Park Central Square. Sorry. Will call this central square and Central Square is going to store information about? The Watt and where and when and how all the basic stuff is in central square. Now the details about the what is mindfulness? We're going to store in. 3 boxes over here and the details about why practice it. We're going to store up here. And the details about how to practice it. We're going to store down over here. And then down here we're gonna make 3. Yin Yang type shapes. Just because they're pretty. But they'll also contains some information sort of interesting. So this then suggests that we could make a line here and a line here and the line here Anna line here. And make this into a nice little Octagon. So the details are in the Octagon and that deep stuff is going to be in the center in the second Octagon. So we're going to draw panel here. That's going to store deep well. We're going to draw panel here. This is going to store deep information the deep game of how. This panel here is going to start deep information about the where. This panel here. And this panel here. And then these circles here. Are going to store? Broad information. About the whole universe. Where in we will see the themes of expansion and contraction played out? So that suggests that we could sort of do something like this, this like this. And we have a second nice little after gone. Yeah, and we've got this nights gonna be like this OK and this and this and this. So see the general pattern here, OK your basic answers are here details here. Deep use here and then we're going to see the whole arc. Of the physical world. From galaxies to atoms. This point here. So get the general idea of how we're going to store information. It looks like Amanda lot very much doesn't, it in fact, Mondal's have many levels of meaning one of them is that they're actually a Palace of God that you're looking from a bird's eye view and so there's 4 gates. Yes, it's very much like among the law this is a. This is a Cosmo gram. It's a picture of the universe. It's a psychogram it's a picture of consciousness. It is hold a gram. A picture of the path. And it's an idio graph ID IO, not IDEO. IDEO Adarrial Gram in that sense, is like a Chinese character ID. IO gram is. That means a video means personal or private. It's a picture of my mind. It's an idiosyncratic psychogram. I'm sorry, it's different from the rest of it. Um. But the joke Oh I see. I failed the koan. So. Now here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to show you the actual thing. I'm going to turn this board around they're going to see the giant thing, but I'm warning you that, even though it's pretty big. You can't make out the details because all by the way all the information. Is stored in hieroglyphics? Which you've seen all of 'em? OK, during this 2 weeks, but you can't see them from where you're sitting. But you will be able to see them from the sheet that I'm going to pass out to you. And then you'll be able to follow everything so I probably need some help twisting this around. Roma. It's pretty isn't it now like I say you can't see the symbols from where you are even if you have a good vision, but. An and then pass out something that you can look at but. Here it is. Here is your senses. Write your conduct. A life treats you. And the answer to the question what is mindfulness concentration clarity equanimity? Why practice mindful us total human happiness? What's in? How do you practice mindfulness techniques? Daily cycle yearly cycle daily cycle have a good time. What's the history of mindfulness show monic. Prius prehistoric show monic origins, historic meditative traditions? Present research, possibly new Donovan New Age. Uh. This is the basics what why where where now the details details on Watt. What is concentration? Well, I've given all the lectures. I'm not going to go into it. But you know, there's is what it is what it is it instances, the deep view and the taste and the same information for sensory clarity and the same information for equanimity details notice. It lines up 1:00 to 1:00 details about this you store here. Details about this There's the noting board. There's the focus on positive board iconographically represented positive affect is smiling positive behaviors legs positive. Cognition is a brain ideal or archetype is holy figure positive situation is a dawn similar to this, but then this is other and you could do it in the visual auditory somatic. We don't show the do nothing bored 'cause it's nothing. And this box tells you the four kinds of information you can extract from these boxes their strategies for formal practice their ways of classifying cutting up the pie of sensory experience their ways of formulate of figuring out applications for certain jobs in the world? How can I deal with this? How can I do deal with that you can formulate your strategies at your tool kit and also it gives you a detail view of the history. That's a a sundial you remember that, we went through this whole thing and we outlined the whole history of world contemplation based on these categories, so these are the four types of information you can extract from the game boards. Uh. So details about this. Details about this. What up here details about Mister Happy Head? OK. What surface happiness? Avoiding pain getting pleasure, avoiding pain? What's deep happiness experiencing pleasure times, mindfulness and what's instead of avoiding pain, you can experience pain, divided by mindfulness, reducing suffering? What does the mind want it want stuff to shine it's light on all these different problems but what does it really want to shine it's light? And the socket that it's connected to what you think you want is to avoid. Don't know mine, but what you really want is to be able to experience don't remind us and empowerment. But what you think you want, which is valid is good situations, sunny weather. Not bad weather. But what you really want because it leads to these things is positive behavior. So if you get this for yourself, you're going to be very happy. You asked me what's the definition of enlightenment, so this is a figure with a :) but the outline is very diffuse. There's no separation between inside and outside no thingness to separate. And our consequences of that is that you want to serve you want to serve materially. You want to serve by this is a mouth teaching mindfulness mouth, not fit you give Donna you support those that serve materially and you support those who teach so this gives you more information about this now, let's go deep. This is deep this is basics. Detail detail detail this is just for decoration, but it's sort of cool because this reminds us that our sensory experiences again young thing. And we see that in detail over here. This reminds us that our path our techniques at a deep level arise through an interplay. Maybe not exactly in young but there's a little expensive contract. If so this reminds us of the deep view over here. This is practice. This is the deep view of practice. The interplay of active versus passive work with the parts work with the whole make discriminations bright discriminations. Manifest itself. Go into the Nosa. So this is. This is the sort of the yen. Yang, the inner game of practices here and the sort of yin. Yang of sensory experience. The basic molding forces. The tug of subjective versus object if activation. The surface manifestations of expansion and contraction. The deep manifestations of expansion and contraction and the effortless activity of time itself rising and passing simultaneously. These are the forces superficial and deep that mold sensory experience, so this. This is this is the doorway to the deep view on this. This is the doorway to the deep view on this and this is the doorway to the deep view on the universe. Displayed here. The. The title of the universe is. Omega. Which is that like that related to the cosmological constant it's big it's the number it's the interplay of expansion and contraction that molds the universe as a whole. Then the universe is at the finer scale. The smallest times smaller spatial scale is the plank and then this thing with the dot. This Sir component represents all the structures that arise in between the universe as a whole. And the Planck scale the cosmic space scale and they plunk spatial scale. There's all these structures. That sort of seem to reflect a contract if Corrine expensive cloud or something along those lines and what are they galaxies supermassive black hole in the center effusive cloud of stars sons? We talked about it or an in between the expansion of thermal photon pressure in the contraction of self gravity. Planets. Core mantle atmosphere interactions cause the in and out of the core and mantle cause surface continents to flow. The rising and falling of thermal currents caused the weather to flow. On the human being anatomically. Scott it's got nerves that input this process in the brain. Motor goes out. Heart. And the Kappel Aries, it's an expansion contraction thing, we have a similar kind of structure and in our complicated of all creatures. We are the ones that are most aware of the input output in terms of cause and effect. So we live very much in that world. Also, the cell. I gave a whole talk about how this cell is formed by lipid bilayer. OK, with the with a polar ends sticking out into the watery environment on the outside of the watery environment on the inside. Creating an inside outside situation, then macro molecules like proteins with nonpolar core. And surrounded by polar atoms are polar radicals. And So what did those polar radicals do well. They can migrate into this membrane and start to create very complex interactions that are input output of energy and matter and information into the cell. That same sort of deal contractive core surrounded by this Halo and then atoms look very much in some ways like galaxies and at the base of it. Is the mathematics? The operations of mathematics. Which all have the same basic structure just different flavor? It's an intertwining of 3 kinds of polarizing and canceling activities. You have movement you have you have? Step forward step back, don't move you have stretch out pull in. Don't move you have world this way world that way don't move. All the movements of the dancer. Are represented by the mathematics and? Therefore the The fact that the mathematics seems to have this polarization cancellation type of situation. Shouldn't surprise us because we've discovered it in our own sensory experience seems to be something very fundamental about the way so it's sort of at the base of what models all of this there was a famous file famous bio mathematician named how Dane HALDNE as an Englishman and this was back and I guess the Victorian Oregon. Guardian period. Maybe not quite that old, but back there early 19th century, he was active someone once asked him. Based on his study of mathematics and biology had, he been able to discern any characteristics of the creator. Could you say anything about God's personality based on his development of this field of biomathematics and you said yes as far as I can see the main characteristic of God is that he has an inordinate fondness for beetles, but actually I would paraphrase how they? I think God has an inordinate. Fondness for Contrast and cancellation. That seems to be the pattern. Let me see very broadly. And that is everything important that I know. I hate you.

To experience that in our inner and outer see, hear feel. And to ride on that in how we express ourselves in body motion speech and the voluntary parts of the thinking process are triple Karma. So to speak our actions are motor circuits to experience the flow of emptiness in our sensory circuits. Am to express' that very same spirit in the bounciness and spontaneity of our motor circuits. This is the paradigm that I like to use for how this path works. Up. And I mentioned that around the world there are. Numerous ways and throughout history, numerous fundamental ways have been discovered to come to this, you can sort of deconstruct things through careful observation. I like that because I can turn it into a systematic algorithm that loops and branches. There's in theory, the possibility of nurture positive as a path to that. Particularly as it's done in the flood Rihanna traditions. The deity yoga, where you eventually learn how to manifest. The deities from the void and at the end of the period of the deity Yoga period of the DD, yoga is called the gerim which means the stages of generation and then that's followed by so prim where it's all dissolved back into. The emptiness and often they will use special physiological yogik practices to facilitate getting the emptiness down into the cellular level of ones being like the darkness of non rope and so forth if you're interested. So versions of nurture positive can achieve this at least in theory, then there's the whole OK do nothing approach. Just call off the search. And then there's sort of be conscious of consciousness self inquiry shine. The light back on itself who am I. What am I kinds of approaches. I think those are. Sort of the four main highly contrasting strategies that we saw find around the world I encourage People to do it works different things work for different People at different times. I'm a little bit of verse. 2 People that claim. There's only one way that is stunningly better for all human beings that has just not been my experience different things work for different People at different times. So. Um. Pick your Medison. And hopefully if you keep with it. It will gradually converge or maybe suddenly converge to this kind of bouncy experience of you can call it liberation. You can call it unification. You can call it annihilation or you can call it. Creation that's my version of creationism OK. My version of creationism is that you see how consciousness creates the inner and outer world moment by moment and you participate in that so form is emptiness. That sort of the first part of the process and then emptiness. This form is. Another theme that presents itself as you begin to be able to sort of enjoy seeing the world manifest and the self manifest. Moment by moment continuous creation, Briard Yashma, iron in the Hebrew. The are the creation nation means both self and thing so the creation of self and thing map from iron the divine nothingness. So. I left off by saying that in the Jewish Mystical tradition, the ability to do that is. Related to an important theme call tekuno lobbed amending of the world. Which of course, is not other than the body's office service? So.","title":"Pick Your Medicine (for Enlightenment)"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/practical-game-plan-of-shinzens-techniques-strategies-shinzen-young/","text":"Well, this is really interesting because this to me, this is the modern who pia. We're reaching out to People now, what I decided to do was OK if. If we're flying under the banner of unintentional skill set. Well, we want. Them to apply these skills. In a way that they are going to dramatically grow so. The base, I outlined this in the what is mindfulness, but this old strategy is so the categories of the basic mindfulness system are designed to produce insights right off the bat. So that it's not just that they're going to get a little bit of of concentration kind of thing, but there explicitly developing concentration sensory clarity equanimity and they're learning how to parse their sensory experience in such a way that the fundamental insights can arise without a bus trying to get them to leave a certain thing. So we're going to provide you with an intentional skill set. We're going to provide you with the way of. Analyzing your sensory experience, which is not any doctrine or belief system. It's obviously is the case that we see and we hearing we feel. And then People can hopefully start to have. Really significant experiences. So. That to me is the is a modern incredible opportunity for Empire.","title":"Practical Game Plan of Shinzens Techniques & Strategies ~Shinzen Young"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/pros-cons-of-dharma-maps/","text":"So the topic was the pros and cons of Dharma Maps. Maps that sort of map out OK, you know here's the state. I think you were mostly think of stages. Yeah, it's like you go through these stages and this is what happens and then this out, but it's in this happens, so there are all these Maps so what's the pros and cons in general of having these Maps and what's the pros and cons of this map versus that map kind of thing I'm assuming that's the one I like this. Yes, and I was afraid of that because that was what I would have gone to the wika pedia and come all prepared. How to make comparisons and contrast but then again, I would have missed my body works so maybe I'll have time tomorrow. There's 16 of them right 16 stages. I think and I have a vague recollection, but I'm not going to pontificate based on that. Yes, I also have to think about it, but I can probably say a few things broadly on this issue. Many years ago. The Corolla Institute, which is an academic Buddhist study Institute associated with the Zen center of La had a an entire seminar where they invited Buddhist scholars. To present papers on? Stages at Maps throughout the Buddha's world. An I tried to find it on line. I couldn't I think it would be really cool. If anybody wants to see if that was ever published or is available someplace or others simply scholarly collections where this issue is discussed in its full breadth and depth quality work with Diane. I think you made the right to the map is not the journey. Now Buddhism broadly is 3 vehicles and then within that there is a gazillion other subdivisions. It's 2500 years. And half the world and now the whole world and Buddhism is just a subset of World Mysticism anyway. So broadly well if we're going to talk about Maps and you know that kind of thing we really should frame. Buddhism within the larger context of world contemplative practice, so it's a huge and very rich question. That you bring up so let me just start collaborating and see what comes up first. I'd like to share my own experience at well actually not before we do that. So 3 vehicles. Numerous subdivisions and that's just a subset of what's worldwide so within Buddhism? What do we have well let's see. We have the 10 Oxherding Pictures. That's well. That's why most popular YouTube presentation, which tells you that People are really into stages and you know what have you then that's used in said. Let's see here's the deal. There's different versions of the town and there's there's one that has 8 so this already tells us that it's not exactly constrained to exactly tap. What else is there well there's the one that I frequently use myself? Which is the four classes of Noble individuals for Aria poop color. These are Maps for a lifetime of practice. This is like really big picture stuff up on an alchemy. Oraha so that's a stream enterer once returner not non richer and worthy. If I were to translate these into English over a lifetime of practice or in traditional belief over lifetimes of practice. You pass through. These 4 stages, but then there's stages of insight, which are 16 stages that proceeds stream entry. I believe so I'm going to tell you it's all is fine subdivision and then there's the four Jama's the age of as the 9:00 chamas. Which are not exactly pastor like but very definitely demarcations an and are related then the Chinese have their out there oxherding pictures. That's events out there that will fit hurting pictures and there are various stages and some of those elephant, earning pictures look an awful lot like some of the versions of the Oxherding Pictures and since. Yeah, I remember that Easter to bed and western China or the same place OK, so we're not surprised that there would be. There would be interactions, there, even though the political concerns of those, 2 cultures don't like to they have they definitely have access to grind with regards to history and that can sort of get in the way? What else is there well that embodies off stages. And then there are to zans 5 degrees and I pretty sure there's a 5 stage. One five stage model. It's prominent in the card. You Lenny I could be wrong about this you get the general idea here there's a lot. Um. So. Now I'll tell you my own story. I started out not as a Buddhist practitioner. But as a Buddhist scholar and actually have very clap that I had that academic background in that training. It was serious graduate level training that involved mastering half dozen languages of Asia and and reading. These things in the original languages, etc, etc. So I'm glad I have that background. But in some ways well. I remember when I was at the Zen Temple in Japan. I started out one of the senior amongst their set. Because you know, I could I could really impress that I I mean. I aspect of Chinese and sound square that you said. Someday all your learning will be very useful someday in the distant future when you're in a position to teach it's going to be really, really good that you know all this stuff academically. But right now, it's like totally getting in the way he was totally right. So what happened to me was. I spelt I would say at least 15 years, the first 15 years of my practice. Torturing myself. With regards to where are my app on these Maps? How you know how my experience this yet and then it it was actually like literally tortured it was like? Um. If if I read some classic thing. It's like Oh my God. There's a stage. I haven't heard of even what to save achieved. I never even heard this one well. That's another one to put on the list of I'll never be anywhere. Until I Experience Excellency and I mean, it was horrible. It was like for me because there was so much grasping around the notion of I gotta get somewhere and I gotta get these signs and there's. All of these things to do well. Fortunately eventually I grew up and grew out of that. But that is one of the dangers of having these Maps OK. We're going to talk about pros and cons. I certainly going to talk about pros. But there's certain comments. One of them is is that that get very concerned with rating. And, of course, that just links into the whole thing that when did it start? The six grade kindergarten certainly by middle school by high school. It's all about maiden rate right so its status. And so it links into all of that stuff, etc, etc. Uhm the other possible comma about these Maps is what I was talking about. Which are briefly alluded to which is? Voting an inordinate amount of time in Enerji, an emotional investment in the Maps or the quest the MapQuest the quest for the right map. Time in Enerji that is therefore not devoted to practice. So if you go on the Internet. Most Buddhist time in Enerji on the Internet is being spent in contention about who's got the right now. You don't know whether to laugh or cry because there's. People People that. Are interested in making the journey? Are not interested by and large in debating about? Who's got the right now? By and large. Because there's only so much time and energy and out of a tropi as well. I don't want to start to make the journey to. I'm sure that this is the very best right because. Yeah, I don't wanna be like not doing the very best. And then what happens is that? Yeah, years pass and People just study an argument study an argument study and argue. So what I find useful, although I know to say this is offensive and confusing perhaps but I did myself. Take great comfort in the notion which I alluded to briefly at his already annoying People, the notion that actually none of these Maps really work very well. By my standards of what I would call work very well. Meaning that I know enough based on my own personal experience. Animal as a professional meditation teacher and as pretty good dilettante scientist. I know enough to know that we can do all lot better. With regards to making enlightenment available to great masses of People. By re adding inhumanity and I mean in the next few centuries. Uh. It will take a combination of 3 things. Deep pore practice. A scientifiche mentality. And out of the box created. But there will be People probably dozens maybe hundreds of people in the future that bring these 3 things together. Now it seems to me not unreasonable that. They will come up with things that changed the course of human history that dramatically change the course of human history. All of the Maps and methodology's that we now have Essentia Lee are based on one. Approach, which is introspection. An individual looks with him. Discover certain things. AFF creates a formulation based on. Often, based on in park on what they've learned for the past. Usually taking some parts of that rebelling against other parts and more often, creating something new. That wasn't there before some combination of accepting the past, rebelling against the past and. Then a new model a new path arises but it's still based on an individuals introspection. And it's it's pretty good when I say that are all relatively ineffective. I just mean that. It takes a very long time and most People are not most, human beings are just not willing to put the time in Enerji, like you and I are into this path. So. What what is lacking? Is an object if you of what's going on? View based on hard science at evidence? What is also lacking is. True collaborative dialogue. Among the Masters and among the Masters in their students. The Great. Right now, the Great Masters. Most of them are old-fashioned old Asians. With new which you cannot communicate in an open peer to peer kind of dial walking. They won't do it with you as a student it's just not on their cultural. Radar and they won't do it among each other, either because it's just too much at stake. So they're not like scientists in science. There could be a Nobel laureate up there talking about something and I could be a graduate student. And I can get up and I can say you're wrong because of this, this, this and this. And if I'm right. If that's I've got evidence to back it up. Then. That's it OK. It's over OK, even though I'm just uh no one that no one's ever heard about this guys got a Nobel promise he was wrong. I quoted out something that kind of thing that doesn't happen. In the context of meditation teacher. But I think it will as things become more modern and more western and you start to have really Frank Dialoguing. Among the Masters, an among the Masters of their students, so we combination of. Turning the lens of science towards it. Plus really being willing to discuss things. Specifically, to look at each others Maps discuss in an open way. What's this? What's this now. I don't quite think it works. That way, etc, etc. That will probably happen in the future. So now of course, when I say that in general, they don't work well based on what I think. Will eventually replace them? In the future. Don't get me wrong. Relative to not using these Maps and relative to not doing this practice. Well forget about that OK, the alternative to what we now have is horrific. The alternative to not doing it, so you know it's good that we have this. I just think we can, we meaning humanity. Can potentially do a lot better? So OK, So what should we think about what should we How should we think about these Maps? Well, I pointed out some of the columns. Let's talk about some of the pros. They can give you an idea of where to go. What to look for? They can give you an idea of what's optimal to do when various things occur that's really useful. On they can motivate you it's like well? Why do it if there's not goodies at the end? Um or in the middle, or even maybe at the beginning. So you can be motivated by this and you could be informed by it. So you know what to look for so that's good. Um. They are based at least in part on real people's real experience and those are by and large real people with very, very deep experience. Um so people with very, very deep experience. That's something we need to pay attention to. However, it is also important to realize that not everything that appears in those Maps. Is necessarily a deep persons deep experience? Because other factors enter into the creation of these things. What are some other factors well? Some master. 1000 years ago might have said some things OK. To a student. And when that student at but they didn't write it down and what that student wrote it down well that students. Ideas are there mixed with that Masters idea. Perhaps their speculations, OK, so you cannot be sure that you're getting the Ipsa Dixit, the very words. That were sad Furthermore. These things were usually written by hand, not printing printing printing as well. Chinese happening along time ago, but it written by hand, so you get scribal error. So if you start to get all fundamentalist about exactly what's there, you know well. This it must be exactly. That way well. It just might be some scribal error. Um. Also, because of the authoritarian nature of these cultures. There is a need to make your innovations appear to agree with scripture. So. They can there can be a forcing where it's like forced on to a certain model that has been passed out. All of these. Therefore give us our caveats, not to get fundamentalists about what's literally there. On the other hand. As I said. By and large these are important experiences of deep Masters. And so there's really something to learn. The boot up. Said that there are 4 basic 3 epistemological bases are * * apology means the investigation of how we know how we gain valid knowledge, so in Ancient Greece. It was the same in ancient India was the same there's 3 bases. Direct experience. Logical inference at reliable authority. Now the rejected reliable authority. He said base yourself on direct experience an analogical inference, but the fact is. Maybe the fact is that? Consulting with an expert is a good idea OK. Uhm but there's a difference between consulting with an expert. And Reading, something that. Was written? Hopefully, by an expert 1000 years ago, but may have other things that have entered in there. Because when you When you consult with an authority you can dialogue. But when you've got. A text that is calm down to you. You can't dialogue with the person that wrote that text. So the good news is that there's probably stuff in there that is hugely valuable. The other news is though, that. We can't. We can only itself very one sided communication. It's not like when you hire A consultant. And you say you know this person knows what they're talking about so let's see what their opinion is and then you can ask questions, etc, etc. So. Those are some of the pros and cons of having these Maps. Um. I myself Don't have about. I don't I don't. Say that your pass through certain stages. Delineate what those stages are. Uh. I. But I do give you some general trends. I say that overtime you're going to notice an elevation in your concentration clarity and equanimity. And that's why I do have some pretty dramatic effects on your life so I like to talk more more along those lines yet inevitably. We want to know that we're making progress. In some way or another so I will give you 4 criteria. That you can use to judge your progress. Starting with Oh, the least what would I say. Starting with each of these criteria is valid. But there's a hierarchy. Of maturity. OK and I'm going to end with the most mature. So that means I'm going to begin with the least mature, but don't. You don't have to take that as a put down the least mature criterion is. During periods of practice. I have experiences that are unusual interesting fun entertaining and so forth. An awful lot of People for an awful lot of People that is the criteria OK. That's if you want us if you want to sell spirituality, you sell entertainment. Um. But I'm not saying that that's completely without validity. Because if fun and interesting and unusual things happen. Then that's gonna motivate you can keep practicing. So from that perspective that's fine. The only problem at us. I don't care who you are or who your teacher is or what you're doing OK. It ain't gonna always be fun and interesting and entertaining unusual things happen. So then when it's the opposite of all those if you hold out this criteria. These criteria of fun interesting unusual entertaining. Then when the opposite of those happen for a period of time. Which could be perhaps a long period of time then it still with meditation you don't want to do it any. So you know that's one criteria because have fun if you can. Oh, a little bit more mature is during a formal period of practice. You can actually taste mindfulness. You can taste concentration clarity and equanimity right while you're doing the practice. And each one of them has its own taste its distinctive reward taste and it's a mature Pollet learn how to taste them. There's just a taste of being concentrated and as my chick sent Lee High pointed out that's an intrinsic reward just to being concentrated doesn't matter what your concentrated on independent of the particular focus hence. You can be doing a God awful boring task. Like licking stamps or what the nuns that the archetypal non task is stepping up communion wafers like hours and hours every day. Just making these communion with OK now that's I would suggest you that is either heaven or hell depending on how recollected you are recollected isn't Catholic work for somebody. So if you're tasting like Shelly, some of you know, Shelly on. So before she became really impressive cycle therapist back when we were kids, she used to do temp jobs and. It was literally like licking envelopes. I put stamps on or whatever, so she go to these temp jobs and. They would be. There will be other temp workers doing this as the day progressed, you could see their moods. Deteriorate OK, they would just like by the end of the day they were just like you know, not in a very good thing. But she would just get higher and higher and higher and higher because she it was some of it was Karma Yoga, it was a tasted concentration samadi? Of somebody was there all day so I mean, she left. She was just like you know you doing. This * job pardon. My French but the more * job. It is they actually easier just to Meditate in that sense, right the simpler so with that taste of concentration so the clarity has its own taste and the equanimity is the taste of releasing catharsis of purification. So yes, if you could actually taste those things while you're doing formal practice. Then. Yeah, that's good that's a sign of progress, but what what about when you can't takes those things 'cause That's gonna happen. Why you can go for years in with very deep states of mindfulness. But then I there something happens in the external world that's pretty challenging or nothing's happening in the external world, but it's just time for the for the next layer of stored material to release and suddenly it seems as though you're back to square one. You can focus. It's just like everything is surface. It's like I never meditated before now you're not really back. To square 1:00 o'clock is not pointing to where you started OK date. Many days have passed OK, not the same day even though it seems like the Clock is still pointing to 12:00 o'clock or what have you but it seems that way. So you're not going to have those reward flavors. So then about well if that's all that you use to judge your practice with then you're not going to want to meditate? So what's the next mature more mature criteria. Is not now linked to what I experienced during formal practice? It's linked to the long term effects of the practice in daily life. It's possible you might not have anything unusual or entertaining during the practice. It's possible. That you might not even taste concentration clarity or equanimity individually or collectively. But you notice there's a trend in daily life as your soda pop around in the world. Um. Tour with regards to 5 things one or a combination of the following 5. Less suffering. More fulfillment. Um. Insights understandings about things sort of happen, either personal or transpersonal. Improvements in your behavior. And kind of sets of love and service for humanity a disappearing of that. Fundamental alienation that separates inside and outside and along with that sense of larger identity that. Oh, it is your privilege to serve. If if in one or a combination of these. Could just be Watt? Often it's reduced suffer it's not not necessarily the whole list. But if any of these areas. You're noticing improvements and it seems to be linked to the practice. Then we say that you're making progress practices work. Um. The most mature criteria. Is? To just do it practice and not really just do the practice to do the practice in and not really thinking that much about the goals. Asthma is it me once said when asked directly what is sub Tori? What is enlightenment? He said Satori to Satori then I turn on cuckoo pet sogar noch Unarco Today show. I think you could say that in Satori Enlightenment is the passing away of the distinction between Enlightenment and not enlightenment. Which is a very empowering statement? In a lot of different ways. So you might say that how far away are you. From Enlightenment, Um. Would be measured in exactly how? How much you identify with the moment by moment arising of the conviction. I'm an alignment that I don't be. So the length of time between where you're at now and Enlightenment is no longer at the length of that thought why not enlightened. Depending on your relationship to that thought each time it comes up. So very fast after Enlightenment and have a complete experience profit belief that you're not enlightened. Now you understand the complete experience I described a complete experience complete experiences of paradoxical experience. It's infinitely flow and absolutely vacuous at the same time. OK, so. Um. Here's a cut let's see I will tell. I did actually write down a couple things. Oh, OK. Oh, OK in Chinese. So here are. Some common beliefs about the Maps. That People have? And. That don't agree with my experience. I was saying that way. One very common belief. Is that there's this thing called Enlightenment and? Before it happens to you. Your messed up. And after it happens to you. Everything is perfect now. You know when we say say it that way. We sort of liked laugh and well no ones that naive but actually. This notion is deep down every People OK because I see it. I it's like even though we say that, like even if we use a terrified of model OK and we say Enlightenment is stream entry. What is well there's like 3 more steps right? And although it may seem from Patout Jenna to Aria or 2 A St to sell to a partner to Jenna means you're not there yet means literally means an ordinary person, but to general so from producer not to some of the Palmer seems very far. But sort Aparna 2 RA ha. That distance. That's really far OK. Stream enters All of the place all of toy. Our hearts Ray I mean, I've met a few that probably were or could have been if they wanted to be Sasaki well, she could be if you wanted to be not sure he wants to be in our uh. Where you say well wait that doesn't make any sense but when you're that enlightened? The difference between Enlightenment and an alignment goes away OK. So we can't really fathom the decisions of People like that. You look at the classical path and you see the descriptions of what our hearts are supposed to be like well soccer. Oh, she's not that way. But you sense, he could be that way if you wanted to. He just doesn't want to sever the connection to humanity that's covered bridges thoughtful. I mean, the ones that I met. From SE Asia like Tom Crusader, you could find him on the Internet OK. You could actually get videos of tough. The town pullers say at all. He was a reputed our heart. I'm You 2030 years at how long ago, I don't Remember Remember some of you can remember. When I was downtown at CNC and Korea down at my own center. There feel yak Charlie Judy. Go back that far. You remember, yeah, you do remember. I remember picking you guys up at that at the at the station downtown. I remember ice cream truck and it's a phrenic derelicts mariachi on one side and the sino Vietnamese opera another side. To say nothing of the gunshots and Turf Wars of the drug dealers fighting on the front log were sitting there, meditating that's the center. I used to have amazing New Years. El Barrio. It's the Battle of the bulge, governments very well, they will automatically so this thing of saying sending. It's OK now you know it's really like very anti climactic for me like last night was it. Last night, the night before. Whatever you know hit the building here. I heard maybe a firework somewhere. We don't only have People going because we're just too far away from things but when we were at the community meditation center downtown. And we did the thing that I've been doing this, you know the chance. You know money. Part man then we bring the battle exactly but I've been doing that for like 40 years or something OK well down down there. It would start like would be a minute before you nor was the Bell was gonna rain because OK because the gunshots would start and then it would just reach this crescendo all sites and you could actually see the tracer bullets going up out the window. I think it's illegal to shoot off guns. So then you get the bill right just speed this fire. Grounds going off in all directions, but anyway, back in those days, which had their charm. But sure glad were grew out of that, but back in those days. When I give classes there be about 4:00 or 5 people in it was pretty small operation. So one of my residents. Just I used to do this thing on Monday or People would come. So one of my residents calls me up and he says. Tom Pulu Sale sad eyes like the Burmese equivalent of Roshi. OK Tombulu TAUNGPULU. Tombulu say it all is in town. He's at the brewery's temple. And he says he's willing to come over and talk to your group tonight. You know this is like that joke about Jesus shows up in the parish church site so Oh my God. This guy was a reputed are hot. He was old, he had not gone horizontally for 30 years. Every night, Yasa for the last 3 decades. They carry them around in a palenque win kind of thing. Ann. Any came OK, he came to my Little Center in Korea town. You didn't speak any English have translators and he did not look like any human being that I ever saw. I mean in terms of his body language or whatever like I said look him up on the Internet OK. It's like. Death Walking Dead man walking OK here it was like imagine a human. Made out of rubber you could just like pull on any party in that I mean, it would just like stretch. There's nothing there to Mrs so yeah, this guy was probably are hot, but So. Hey, I can do one Gaza. Skype, but like you turn Ilyasa That's a whole other you know. So anyway. So so first of all when I call Enlightenment History Mentry and that's doable by you folks. I mean that's that's the stated goal of my program. Up. So you know you think that People have this idea. All I'm going to get Enlightenment and then everything's gonna be OK well the distance between. Having seen those self for good. And 4 purification of consciousness that is a huge difference distance, but no matter how much you tell People that you get these weird things that they expect. Senior Masters to somehow be perfect OK. Or People that are enlightened in the stream measures level. Then People get all weirded out when their screwed up in certain ways, even though we say OK. The working this whole thing out is. It takes all of it, it's a lifetime, OK enlightenment in the sense of stream meter is just the beginning. Of it, however, many times we say that People that are enlightenment, some level when they screw up People seem to be surprised. For some reason cycle there right now 'cause they do this and do that and like it just means that you've seen no self for good forever, but it doesn't mean you worked out all your bad habits. By any means that's what those 3 other stations are. So this, this notion either expressed or implied or somewhere in the subconscious that because someone has a deep practice. Even a practice so deep they have abided permanent Oneness Nothingness. The the notion that. That all well everything's perfect and they never suffer about anything and they never make mistakes. It doesn't work that way. And besides even if you become an are hot. That's great, but that's not a Buddha. What's the difference between a Buddha in our heart? Buddhist tradition as asked that question the printer is a special kind of our heart. So what's different about the boot died from our hot is like fully enlightened. Has impeccable behavior and never suffers? Um. How? So then what's the? What's the difference between that Anna Buddha and the Buddhist Scholastic. Tradition says, and I think it's a very good answer. The difference is that a boot that is a creative are hot about the comes up with something that no one discovered before. Number one and #2 it is of sufficient. Power man relevance that it changes human history. So from that perspective there's only been one put us so far. That we now have historically 2500 years ago that is that that big an impact on the world being enlightened. But I think we're due for the next one. OK, but the next one may not be a person. Maybe a team. Of it lightened. Create scientifically oriented out of the box thinkers. Maybe a century from now. With the technology as it will exist. Uh. OK, so. This you know this notion of. So I can see why some teachers avoid the E work because People have this idea that it's like. Oh, you're screwed up then you're enlightened and everything is perfect. The other notion that People seem to have is that enlightenment happens suddenly. It can. Um. Uh but in my experience not necessarily. Uh. I see that in a lot of cases, it just. So that comes on OK and you acclimatize do it, you may not really quite realize that you actually have become in light. Because it wasn't son Andrew. Um. Uh. So. There's that point. Can it happen suddenly dramatically sure? But I don't particularly aim at that. However, some teachers do they aim at getting you to have this sudden epiphany kind of thing and if they have a track record in producing those results, then that's that's a good teacher. When I look at teachers. I don't look at say, Oh, this one has this map that I agree with. And this one. As this other map that I don't agree with. But this person says is similar to what I say so. You know, there are right or something I don't think that way about teachers. I think about track record. Someone could have a completely different. Perspective that I do, but if they've got a track record. In leading People to significant transformation. I'd rather have a study with that person that someone that bite. Agrees with my methodology, but doesn't have track record. So anyway that is apparently. Another thing that. Uh. Notion that People seem to have is not fairly recently is that everyone has to go through these Dark Knight experiences before they head enlightened. Dark Knight experiences are sort of. Emptiness and no self and it's a bad trip. McConaughey fear and depression and hopelessness and disorientation, etc, etc. And it's horrible and you just have to white knuckle through it. That everyone has to go through these that's not been my experience at all. Now everyone has to go through some fear and some depression and some disorientation, but not necessarily this sort of paralytic thing that could last for months or years. Some People do have through don't worry you'll probably want him OK. One last thing Is the notion that? The map is linear. That there's this step at this step in this step at this step. Because when you act that doesn't agree with my experience. When you actually talk to People that use that and you say, well? Is it like literally that or do you revisit certain steps and does it loop around OK, etc etc. And I'll say, Oh well. Yeah, actually you do go through these things cyclicly over and over again. Which does agree with my experience? But the way it's presented it's not presented that way is presented like there's just this linear progression. So that's why I don't have a linear map. What do I have I have a looping and branching? Algorithm. And I think that a lot of the linear Maps when you really ask what really happens are looping and branching algorithms. So that that impression I can promise you that topologically. A series of points with links. Is not at all the same? As a net mathematically completely different critters, a sequence with arrows that only pointed One Direction. Is not at all even remotely like a directed cyclic graph? So if it's really a looping and branching algorithm. Uh. Then we shouldn't be calling it a linear map which. So I set the thing up so that you do certain procedures. Out certain things happen, some of the things that happen will be walls. You'll have to walk. They'll be a challenge and then there's something optimal to do for that challenge. Some other things that happened will be windows that we windows of opportunity and there's something optimal to do and the whole thing just loops and branches and loops and branches. Optimizing your experience as the months and years go on and that's sort of the view that I like to take. Now, Having said that I don't have a map, etc, etc. It I have to be honest, it is also true that there are certain broad trends. But it's not like every one goes through all of goes through these trends. There is a trend overtime. For the themes of flow. And impermanence and so forth to become prominent in your practice. But that doesn't mean that if that's not the case that your practice isn't working, OK. But I openly talk about flow and so forth. Because I think it's useful to know about it and to work with it and and so forth. So yes, there. There is a tendency as time goes on for many People for that to become more and more prominent part of your meditation landscape. Buttom. As I say it. That's not necessarily the case for everyone. So how do you know if you're making progress well I give you 4? I give you 4 ways of judging if you're making progress. Uh. It is also practically useful. To touch base with at least 1 competent coach at least every once in awhile to talk about your practice to dialogue to see OK? What's working? What may not be working get suggestions and so forth. So. I think that's all that came to my mind tonight in talking about Maps is that OK. It's something. I think in the future when the kind of really open dialogue that I envisage takes place. And when evidence. Object if evidence all of the scientific method is brought into this whole thing. That. I would make it conjecture that. Maybe at 100 years or 200 years. They'll only be 1 universal model that probably be a very complex model because it would have to have to cover all the individual variations of individual human beings, but I suspect that will someday have a true sign something alignment. And I can't say for sure right, but sort my God, tells me well, either survivor won't and if we do survive. I think the future will be very bright that's it's.

OK, when I do intellectual work I can't meditate. Because I've got to do the intellectual work, So what or is there a way I can meditate etc. I'll just share my experience I think different People will have different experiences. But my experience is that when I do intellectual work on. I do writing, I'm trying to figure stuff out. I can't implement uh any kind of formal technique. But. What I can do is I can pepper that experience with little moments of practice in life So what that involves is I call stop on a dime. It's like OK. I'm doing this. I'm doing this. I've been doing this for an hour and I really like to keep doing this, but Stop on a dime. Now, what's gonna happen. Well, maybe everything will be peaceful and formless.

You implemented technique. Even if it's only for 30 seconds. Um. You open up completely to that. In those 30 seconds if you bring the totality of your intention aliti to do a quality period of practice. With whatever earcups. Then you can actually. Do retroactive meditation now retroactive meditation is by definition. Oxymoronic isn't it because it's mindfulness, particularly is always in the moment right now? How can you possibly retroactively be mindful? But you see while you were bumping around doing this doing that doing this doing that all those energies were getting agitated activated. When you stop on a dime. You only have a couple minutes. But if you really bring your AAA game. During those couple minutes. Everything that gets stirred up in that hour or 2 hours of just ordinary unconscious frenetic activity. It's right there in those couple minutes. And if you can have a complete experience of that it effectively is the same. It has the same effect on your overall growth pattern as having meditated for those 2 hours. You do it retroactively, but you have to really bring your A game to whenever got stimulated so when I do things that. I just have to do things. Where I can't keep a technique going during the thing 'cause I'm just doing the thing? Then I pepper it with this stop on a dime star Dama die. So stop on a dime is you stop the activity, no matter how much you want to keep doing it OK. The mindfulness Bell Rang. I remember OK going to pepper the day stop on a dime and then you start Monodia Feelin gone see out. See out. Ln gone. Cirez. Rest. See in gone. No hesitation.

Uh, who was up and said that. Call. Can't remember right now. It will come to our Viktor Frankel. Viktor Frankel said between Between the stimulus and response. There is a gap therein lies your freedom. In daily life. Stuff comes up. And about 3 seconds later, a reaction occurs from you. The degree to which there is mindfulness in that 3 seconds. Or 2 seconds. Therein is measured your freedom, so we want to be able to implement. These techniques instantly 'cause in daily life. 2 or 3 seconds. If you're not Johnny on the spot with mindfulness. The terrorists are in the cockpit. Follow my metaphor. The Lizard Brain is going to run the show and then you look back. It's like? Why did I do that? When I could have done this other thing so. If you have to do actions where you just have to do the action and you can't keep a technique going that's OK, but then pepper it. Stop on a dime.

Is trained themselves to quote say what you mean? You know where I got this phrase from. Say what you mean It's from literature actually sort of Classic in English literature. Uh. It's by a book it's Now the author of the book is named Charles Dotson. Doesn't ring a Bell? Well that was real name is noda plume was? Huh Lewis Carroll very good. Um so Lewis Carroll is known as the writer of children's books and Charles dots dots and is known as the Victorian period mathematician. There's even a theorem named after him not theorem, but a mathematical process and in fact. Oh, I'm going to know I'm going to get on a geek out so I gotta bring myself in this is the problem OK just sort of whatever comes up. * * out. So the Mad Hatters Tea Party. It had it contains a pun. That almost no one realises. Um. A mathematical pun. T was also was a letter that was used as a variable OK. In his day by People who were. Uh. Insisting on the use of imaginary numbers and complex variables and things like that, and Dotson was actually a very old fashion kind of mathematician. It was more in the old-fashioned Euclidean mathematics and he actually didn't like the new map. The new math of the Victorian period, which probably seems like very old math, but the actually he was. Wrong complex variables turned out to be that, like this hugely hugely useful thing, which I'll give a whole. Dharma talk on one of these days. But in any event, yeah, so the T is mathematical pie on the Tea Party anyway at the Mad Hatters Tea Party. There is a dialogue with Alice and the Marsh hair and the dormouse and the Mad Hatter. In which case in which each of those People tell Alice in in no uncertain terms to mean? What you say is completely different from saying what you mean the mad. Hatter says, said something like you need to say what you mean Alice says well I always mean? what I say, and then they get on this big riff. About a these aren't the same at all at all at all to say what you mean. Means that you have an idea and when it comes out in words it's accurate. And it turns out that that's not such an easy thing to do. It takes a lot of training. A lot of care are. We're not stupid we know what we're saying and in our mind. It's evidence based on logical but if you really listen to yourself, saying OK. Sometimes you're not really saying what you mean? What's in your mind is not what the words actually are so I've spent a long, long time trying to train myself to be careful about that and I'm a little bit. How should I say? Finicky prissy fussy about you folks learning how to do the same thing. 'cause I think it's extremely useful. But it's also really hard and the reason that I know it's hard is even though. I work at it and I'm pretty good at it. I'm amazed how many times. I myself and not really quite accurately, saying what I mean? Which is? It happens, it's OK every once in awhile. In retrospect, I look back and I realize to my horror that I said. The opposite of what I meant. And that's like bad. Which I did last night? I don't know if you know what I'm talking about. Maybe you can. Guess what I was trying to convey is that this path. Is available to the entire spectrum of? Culture and philosophy and politics. And that conservative People, which I referred to as quote Republicans and so forth should be as comfortable with. In this setting as any other People, an glory at the notion that that is the case can be the case. But it came out sounding like I was sort of making fun of conservative and Republican. People then that is actually the way it came out, which was exactly the opposite of what I had in my head. So. Bad bad bad with someone pointed out to me a nice OK, when you're right. You're right so anyway. That's I think a really important point. The types of People that in our culture would be called. Are Conservatives? Were the types of People that in the context of Asia?

Just wanted to mention that.","title":"Say What You Mean"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/science-of-enlightenment-book-excerpt/","text":"Have you ever been in a situation of extreme danger. Where time slowed down? Everything got peaceful. And you felt extremely focused and without fear. And able to respond in a remarkably effective way. When I ask this question to any large group. Several People will always raise their hands and say yes. One woman described going into a state like this when she almost drowned in California's Kern River. As the result of being so tranquil, and present. She avoided panic and was able to survive the incident. She added an interesting comment. If only I could have bottled that state. I could have addicted the world to it. People who have experienced this spontaneous state of extraordinary focus often say that it was the most meaningful day of their life. And that it changed them forever. Sometimes it happens under circumstances of exceptional stress in sports and combat terminal illness accident or assault. But it can also happen at the opposite end of the spectrum. When you're extremely safe and connected say while walking in the forest alone or during a particularly profound experience of making love. In these circumstances, you again find that time slows down. Your mind becomes very peaceful. And you're very present, and focused and unified with what's going on. What few People realize is that such states of presents and focus are trainable? You don't have to wait for unusual or extreme conditions in order to experience them. And it doesn't have to be sporadic or short live. It can be a permanent abode. Indeed. Any person can live their day-to-day life with that level of focus. In other words. A person's baseline of focus can be elevated through systematic practice. The discovery that extraordinary focus can be intentionally cultivated is one of the most significant findings the human species has made. It has enormous ramifications for both our personal lives and our world. The systematic training and focus is called meditation practice.

I had some interesting questions that People are gave me. Uh. So one was is there anything like shop teapot in Buddhism. So. How many People know what the word for what the word shut Depot' meats just curious? Not as many as I would have thought. Well, shotty is Sanskrit word meaning Energi. And pot means to fall or confer. So shock teapot is a sort of ZAP of enerji that you get from a teacher. Often within a Hindu context, but I think it could be. Generalized from that usually done in some sort of ritualized way. Oh. The most famous example would be students. Common the teacher touches them with Peacock Feather or something like this puts her hand on them looks at them does something to cause shop T to arise within that person. So the question is, is there shock teapot in Buddhism found that actually. Can be answered in a whole bunch of different ways? First of all shop T is. Related to Kundalini Shakti. So where does that fit in Buddhism. Where does this energie, which is sometimes expressed in terms of heat, sometimes expressed in terms of a movement up the spine and so forth? Where does this notion fit in terms of Buddhist practice well. The simple explanation is it's an aspect of what I call flow and when I call flow is just my way of talking about impermanence. So. There's two ways that People can relate to impermanence. One is well. It's what happens when you bring a lot of concentration clarity and equanimity to ordinary sensory experiences. Then they present themselves in a wave paradigm as opposed to a particle paradigm so there is no special Energi. Separate from any ordinary experience In other words, the so-called Materi Ality of the world, but carnality of the ones body. The something Ness of ones mind all of these just turned out to be? What happens when you don't have a complete experience of seeing hearing and feeling. And when you have a complete experience which is just another way to say have a very clear concentrated and quantumness experience. When you have a mindful experience In other words, beyond a certain critical value of mindfulness. Those ordinary experiences become extraordinary. They show you their wave nature as opposed to their particle something this nature, so there's no enerji separate from what is ordinary or metaphor that might be? Taken from Einstein is he said that matter is just frozen enerji so ordinary sensory experience. Internaut are seeing inner and outer hearing in outer body that's just. Flow that's just enerji that has been coagulate. Eed Biwott Well, it's been coagulate eed by incomplete experiencing of it. The other way to relate to the energycap thing is that there's this energie and then there is in contrast to that. The material world. And then the goal is to somehow get beyond the material world and to get to this energie, which is desirable that leads to a rather different paradigm, which is that well. There are ways of manipulating this energean, causing this energie to be transferred and enhancing it and so forth so certain traditions like Kundalini Yoga. Qi Gong neck on in China and so forth, they sort of work from a perspective of well. There's this thing called shotty. There's this thing called Chi. It's this energie thing and we cultivate it with manipulate it. We work with it make it stronger and stronger and we can actually use it for doing stuff. That's one paradigm and I think that's a legitimate paradigm. There's nothing wrong with that. Then there is the paradigm that I would use which is that there's sensory experience and E equals MC squared and so the. By fully experiencing the Materi Ality of things, the non Materi Ality becomes evident. Now there's nothing to say that a person couldn't work with in both of these paradigms someone when I was once at a conference of western teachers with the Dalai Lama and someone asked about mixing practices because a lot of Western. Buddhist, a lot of Western Buddhist teachers. Have more than one linneage that is influenced them. So the question was put to His Holiness, the Dalai Lama and he said. Well, it's OK, but you just when you do one practice. You do that practice and you know in the afternoon. If you do some other practice, then you did that practice. So as long as you can understand the complementarity of them and use each system as its own system then that's OK. So there's nothing to say that you couldn't do Kundalini Yoga or Qi Gong, which involves manipulating. Big quote Enerji and also do V possible where you simply paying attention to what is an inflow becomes evident? You have the option to pay attention to it. And yes, indeed the more you pay attention to it. The more prominent it becomes that does tend to create a feedback loop in that way. So so shotty so now we know the shopping part what that means so is there transference of energy. Well, from a teacher to a student in Buddhism. And the fact is in Tibetan Buddhism. Yeah, big type and it's formalized as initiations and there are whole ceremonies built around it. And so forth. So yes, there certainly is that structure within certain parts of the Buddhist world. But what I like more is the way shut teapot is done in the Zen tradition. At least in ring size at, I'm not that familiar with Soto Zen, so those ends a little different. Album in photos and the the row, she sits with you. And in Soto Zen, you you face the wall. OK. Uh. About the Roshi faces out and sees everyone. So that means everyone that's fidgeting or doing what at size open practice right now, I guess in some sense. Maybe this is a little bit of a Buddhist guilt trip It's like you know, maybe you're not going to Fidget so much 'cause you know you're like. Impacting on the row, she's see out. But you get. Uncomfortable enough and lost in your own misery pretty soon. I don't think that guilt trip really helps very much so you know, People do move and Fidget at whatever, so the gift of the Soto Zen Roshis is that they just. Taking all of that an metabolise it as part of their city, but it's done in the Zendo because that but the cool thing that you've actually got not just a roshi, but maybe a bunch of hope. She's sitting with you in Zenda. In Rinzai Zen as far as I've ever experienced it that the Rose. She doesn't go to this and you go to the roshi, but you have one on one interactions. In which you are given Co-op switch all heard about and I've talked about. So that one on one interaction with the Roshi. Is in fact shopping pot but it's never talked about that way? You either catch on or you don't. Um. So, in the interaction while you're. On the surface, seemingly working on this Co op. At the depths that Master is grabbing your belly button. And how did they do that? Well. Some of you may remember the? The teachings of Don Juan by Carlos Castaneda. So it's about this after apologist from UCLA that goes to Arizona and starts to work with his Yaqui Indian. An loses all objectivity an gets sucked into. That culture's way of experiencing things and this is true, it actually it actually happened. It's really interesting and cool story. So at in the 1st book at one point this, the anthropologist Carlos. Asks Don Juan, which is the fictitious name of the oci shaman that he worked with. Uh. Whenever I'm around you all this weird shadow. What is it? And he said, You're just seeing the power of my not doing. Now, when I read that understood. I don't think the anthropologist understood not at that time it was just another. Mysterious weird thing that this guy said you're just seeing the power of my not doing. Those ro she's they don't do anything to grab your belly button OK. In fact, it's the opposite. There it's their emptiness that scrapping you. Their pure doing this, the fact that they are flow whether they're laughing or whether they balling you out. It's just wind. Of nature. And you pick up on their body language. You pick up on all of those things and that is indeed Chucky excepting see that's the sort of the difference between the post and then there's a lot of differences. I mean, obviously they come from different cultures. Historically, etc, etc, but practice wise. Um. A gross oversimplification gross oversimplification would be that in Vipasana, you observed sensory experience until you. Realize. It's Impermanent nature and maybe that's as far as you go or maybe if you're lucky you go beyond that, to not only experience. The senses as flow, but to actually ride on the flow, meaning that the bounciness avoid starts to speak through you and move your arms and so forth. Uh. So that's you might say that. That's impermanence affecting the motor output In addition to the sensory input. So, in the personal use you work with the sensory input and. Some of the personal teachers, it effects their motor output and they have that bouncy liberated quality that you get in zed, but other vipasana teachers. It doesn't affect the motor output and then more. Inert I guess would be the way to put it, whereas in Zen. This is like once again like don't get me wrong. This is a gross oversimplification, but in, then they first train you to train your motor circuits into how to flow within permanent since the Zen schedule and it's the whole enerji of the interaction that you have let the Roshi, who is like moving in certain ways. And then you find yourself moving in those ways so you sort of training your output? To flow with expansion and contraction and then hopefully at some point. It will go beyond your motor circuits and start to infect your perceptions of self and world so that your senses began to flow with expansion contraction and you get liberation so there. It's almost like they do the same task, but in. Opposite order twist. To a certain extent, so when you? So that that for me is a kind of shock to pot because they roshi is conveying the activity of emptiness that put the nature of the activity of impermanence to you and it. It's not talked about. But if you know how to pick up on it. Then. You carry that with you back in the Zendo. So the difference with this kind of shot Depot' versus the Hindu formalized ceremonies or the Tibetans, formalized ceremonies. The difference is first of all. It's not talked about. That way you either pick up on it or you don't. And there's no formalized ceremony ostensibly it's just you interacting with this weird person. And and doing these weird things. But if you so that I like that because there's not all this, I don't know. Specialness about it or What happened? But. What I really like about it and once again what? Represents a very significant difference from say the normal shotty pop thing that you get from some Baba OK. Well, not not distant that I'm just trying to describe the situation the. Normally, what's going to happen, you get your shop keep up from the Bob and then what happens after that, where you all eat. Prasad you sit around you. You chat buttons and everybody feels great, and you all talk about how great the Guru is. You leave and when you need your next fix you come for your next fix. Um, however, in the Zen form shop teapot you go in you have this incredible experience with the Roshi and then Watt then you go back to the zendo an if it's in the winter it's not heated and it is freaking cold if it's in the summer. There's no fan and there's mosquitoes and it's hot and you just want to sleep. But then beat you and yellow, too, and potentially going back to the summer I torture chamber. And. There you get to test to what extent you have truly metabolise the shopping. Can you now apply it to the summer I torture chamber? So the goal here is to create equals not the cycles. Every guru worth is Marla should want equals not a cycles. For real not lip service for real. In fact, as I implied yesterday every guru worth is Marla or her marla should want students that are better than them. End of story. So that form of shot D Pop. You gotta use it. You gotta use it for something real, aching legs. Sleepyhead OK emotions running up the Yin Yang because you're being abused, all day and it's pushing every button that can be pushed OK now how real is that shopping can you experience that as flow? And that's how that Roshi got to be the way they are, and so it goes. So yes, there's that kind of shot D Pop. In Buddhism, and then there's The daily shot depart that we all have now totally because we're always sharing energy with each other. Everyone. To the extent that a person has a practice to that extent, the People around them pick up on that. Uh. And so you're all giving shop teapot. Two other People, whether you're aware of it or not, it may not be as powerful because number one People don't necessarily have the expectation and the expectation is of course, a big part of it. And #2 well, you are shocked you might not be quite as intense as something that's meditated 80 years in a monastic training. But she got something OK and you're also getting shot depart from other People. And in fact, this is going to sound a little weird, but you get it from animals. Who very much are in the flow and you get it from your children until they develop? I talking itself. In the 1st few years of life. What does infant infonews infant in English in fonts from the Latin Infans, which is the present participle of farming which means to speak. Samru does Confabulate and so forth so the infant is the one that doesn't speak yet. Has not acquired external language has not presumably acquired internal language. But there's a certain magic period, there where the intended to Neo Nate and so forth or I don't know how far the magic extends on average, but probably. You know the first year at least we're basically. Your infant your child is a roshi. They are just space. Expanding and contracting and if that's then parenting every time you take care of a baby. I think nature intends that to be a sunset. A shock teapot for the parent to recharge their batteries, which are straight to the Max by parenting Endeavour. So that's you know there's that. Yeah, it's interesting about the no self than not doing. This this is a really weird story, OK, but they tell me that I'm supposed to tell stories so. That's supposed to make a good Dharma talk so this is a true story so. Many years ago. I was driving through Santa Monica. With a student of mine who has since passed away. I don't know if any of you remember it all mightiness, but anyway, this is way back there. Oh, so we were driving in Santa Monica. Now. We had this weird psychic experience. It was like a truly psychic experience. So we're driving down the street and we we both started to look at this homeless person. Who was They were just on the street corner and they? It was evident that there was some mental illness there. But they were just sort of like. You know just sort of like moving OK. And we looked at this guy and we looked at each other and we knew we that we had had exactly the same thought. And it was true. And the thought was. If you clean this guy up. Put white robes put him in front of a group of People and don't let us say anything People would have shut the pot. Yeah. I mean that's a fairly complicated. Because there was just no self there, OK, he was just part of nature. Now apropos of stories. Years later. Um. I was I was at another student's house. And uh. Uh. So I see this. Uh. I see this book. And it's one of these like photo books. You know that People would put on like a coffee table or whatever this was on her piano. Uh. And. I'm hesitant now 'cause I'm trying to remember the exact title of the book. Unfortunately, she had. I don't plan these talks very much so. OK, anyway. It's a picture book it's just pictures. It's like this huge book of photographs. And I start to look through these photographs. And what's interesting is that there's nothing by the? Photographer the person the author of the book. There's nothing at all but what there is, is intro, preamble by Toni Morrison. Now that's a fairly important person in. The world of art and literature and so forth so that tells you well this is. The is somehow a significant book but there's nothing by the person who actually took the photos that says anything about anything at all. In other words, the photos have to speak for themselves. This big book and I'm floating through this book. An I'm like freaking out. Because it's very evident to me, but these are all portraits by the way. It's very evident to me. What this book is about? And. That I had never seen a book like this ever. Um. And. So this is I think some of you know, Mark L. This is at Markel's house, so anyway. Go to Mark Ellen. I say like this book is amazing. And she said, Well, you know, Birdman, the guy that wrote it, or that photograph not because we lost our power. The photographer is distant relative of mine. So. I think well can you get his telephone number, said sure I got his telephone number? So we called him up. And he was there an I said, I told him what I thought his book was about. And he freaked out he said that I was the only person. Who ever understood what the book was about? Of all the People that you want to check this out. Of all the People that had seen it and exhibitions and whatever, so now. I'm sure you're quite curious as to what it's about now I don't want to get the title wrong, let's. Let me just see if I can find it. You're surfing the web. Let's just try here. I was going to do something else with the Internet than this. I'm very klutzy and slow. I don't think that's going to work. You got it working OK. OK let's see if we find it. OK, I found it that's just amazing here it is. Connect give them time to get this fixed. Untangle and be free. Divide and conquer so I give them a more politically correct way to say it. OK. So it is by Robert Bergman. Blue. And the name of the book is a kind of Rapture. So what it is, is he went through. The Rust Belt of the United States. The old decaying cities. Photographing St People. Who for whatever reason? Usually a combination of a hard life and physical and mental illness. Had been thrust into a no self state. In other words, People for whom the blows of life had driven them. 2. And yourself a rapturous no self experience, he went around the country looking for those kinds of People. Catching them at the moment where they manifested than an ego that their hard life had taken them, too. And. You get picture after picture after picture so that the message you know you see one or 2 pictures like that. It doesn't have the same impact, but if you see 50 pictures like that. Then it hits you. What the whole thing is about? So the reason I thought there was so extraordinary is that? Although there's a lot of books. About. Enlightenment or no self coming about through practice. And there are a number of books of People written by People that have had spontaneous enlightenment experiences. Um. What no ones looked at is this whole thing this whole other aspect? And so it's In terms of its subject matter is very unusual. And then in terms of the so the message is very unusual and the medium is unusual instead of writing a book talking about this phenomenon. He shows it to you and you either get it or you don't. So anyway. That's a whole other little riff, but apropos of. Where you might go for your shopping pot?","title":"SHAKTIPAT or ENERGY TRANSMISSION in BUDDHISM"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/shamanism/","text":"Well, there's a lot to say about shamanism, so I'll try to sort of limit it. Uh. First of all. I actually talk about this in my book. The science of Enlightenment, the notion that you can. Look up on consciousness is sort of like a three layered parfait. And you have surface ordinary objectified experience that might be called conventional reality, then you have. The absolute rest on the formless doing. That is at the very quote Center if we wanted to use that metaphor it's not. Perfectly, good, but if you imagine it's a sphere and there's surface and then there's what's in the center. Which is the dharmakaya it's formless? Then there's all these intermediate realms. And. If we think of the spiritual path as a journey from surface to source. Some People are going to traverse those intermediate realms without any unusual phenomena at all. They're just gonna go right down. Some People are going to encounter the pool of poison and pain and trauma and. Such big time. Which is sort of the Freudian subconscious some People are going to encounter the unions subconscious gods ghosts ancestors healing abilities? Etc etc. The Spirit World basically what native People would refer to as a spirit world. Some People encounter both the union and the Freudian version of the subconscious so I say some People encounter. Neither they just go right down. So the There can be a couple extremes with regards to this map. Of the journey one is not uncommon, you start so you're on the surface and the journey is not turning 180 degrees away from the world. It's actually turning orthogonal it's turning 90 degrees. Into an independent demention. Which is the dimension of depth as opposed to surface? So now you're going down of course, each level has its own surface right. So 1 extreme is you go down a little bit and you encounter either the Freudian subconscious or the Union Subconscious. Uh. And if it's The Freudian, you just don't want to go there. If it's the pleasant side of the union well. That's one thing. But if it's sort of weird, and scary archetypal material. You don't want to go there. So you flail your way back to the service like a drowning person gasping for air. I'm never going to go down there again. 'Cause that's just too weird that's one extreme another extreme which is. The extreme I recommend. Is you just keep going down no matter what? Keep a Plumb Line, a direct vector towards the source. Um. Saint John of the I mean, it's not just me that the Christian tradition says the same thing, although they think of it is going up rather than down but it doesn't matter. I mean, the direction of the coordinates grid is doesn't make any difference at all, so Saint John of the cross drew this picture of this mountain. Mount Carmel, which actually exists in the Holy Land. It's near the city of Haifa in northern Israel show and I visited there. It's pretty cool. It's the origin of the Carmelite Order, which was one of the main meditating orders back in the day. Anyway, he drew Mount Carmel. And he talked about subida del Monted Carmella, the ascent of Mount Carmel. Uh. And in this metaphor, God or the source is not at the source. It's actually set up at the pinnacle, but it's exactly the same thing. And on it, he writes. Nada Nada Nada. Ian Mount then. This is how you're going to get there. Nothing nothing nothing and when you finally get to the peak of a mountain. Nothing with a big capital and. And then he he shows these like wild monsters and Flowers and things. He says if you want to ascend Mount Carmel. You cannot allow yourself to be distracted by the Flowers, nor frightened by the Wild Beast. You have to just go straight up so same general idea so the other extreme is no matter what sorts of bouquets or Beasties. You may encounter as you go down. You just keep going down, which in terms of classical. Drive E Posener would just mean whatever comes up. You just observe just observe just absurd that's an extreme. Here's another extreme and you go down to a certain level and you get interested in the content of that level usually it's something that involves special powers. An without realizing it, you turn 90 degrees again and pernicious part of this is you don't know it. You think you're on a vector to the source. But in fact, you're now going parallel to ordinary experience out into the realms of power exploring them. And you can spend a lot of time doing that and as I say there's actually nothing wrong with exploring those realms. Unless. You think you're still going down. Then that becomes a shunt away from progress. What's in between? So between turning 90 degrees again right you're here on the surface 90 degrees down and then gradually without realizing it. You turn 90 degrees again right now, you're going parallel, but you don't know it. So 1 extreme is you're only interested in the realms of power. Lakota Sioux called those People pay shooter, which Azure which actually literally is Medison person or a healer. Then the other extreme is what I mentioned. You don't go into those realms at all. You just purify and get insight and Lakota that is referred to as a witch Asha walk home. A sacred person. The spectrum of classical shamanism, all over the world and this is the original religion of our species everywhere. There was a time when everyone as far as I. Anthropologists know everyone sort of had Essentia Lee, the same religion and it was shamanism. This is the old time religion. Judaism Christianity, Confucianism, what have you they may be old but they're not old the way this is old, they're not 1020 thirty 40,000 years old, OK, so the spectrum of classical shamanism. Ranges through all the oblique angles. From pure power to pure purification. But most shamans that I've ever met are on an intermediate angle. There definitely gaining no self purification insight. There's a component to that vector. Of going down, but there's also a component out an depending on the relative magnitude of your interest in power, what the spirits have to say versus the Egolessness Oneness and so forth so that that's why I speak of. The spectrum of classical shamanism. It goes all the way and in the power area. You can actually get. You can get cultural negatives. That are very intense for those cultures. You get you can have very dysfunctional cultures. It's not just modern People that are messed up OK. There are traditional cultures that have really messed up views of the world. It's not uncommon for example, to believe that death is not natural. Someone dies, it's because someone killed them. And probably kill them with Madison and buy Medison I mean magic. Shot so Native American Indians have an entire vocabulary. It's English so they can in talked Intertribal E. But it's English you would never understand you wouldn't know what it means to shoot Medison at someone, or to get engaged in a Medison war with another tribe. That's warfare. In the power realms and they take that absolutely as seriously as warfare on the surface. It's the same deal someone dies go to the shaman? Why did they die? All those guys up the River shop Madison at us. And then we got to either shoot arrows at them for shoot. Medison back so it's not necessarily a good thing OK. It really depends on the culture. I mean, I've I've had friends that for whom Medison Wars were a serious business. I have to say, I don't share the paradigm but. I knew it was very real for them and they were from these kinds of cultures and so forth so anyway. There's this spectrum that I call the spectrum of classical shamanism and if like. Well, I guess maybe this is going into too much detail. There's a lot of fear in the Navajo culture. For example of shape shape shifters. So there can be some real negatives around some of this stuff OK, so let me tell you a story, a personal story about shamanism. So. I. Years and years ago, I. Decades ago actually. I was running a retreat into San. Steve knows are going to talk about Steve knows the nose. This Medison person. So we were running a retreat at this ranch Doug Boys Ranch. And this is. NI under 40 years ago, I think. So while back maybe not that 35 I guess. And so. Doug was very into Native American spirituality, but he'd grown up in Korea. Actually, his father was I guess in the military. So he knew a lot about Asian culture and he wanted the Buddhist teachers to get together with the Native American teachers. So he said. There's a local tall and autumn that's a tribe that anthropologists used to call the Pima Papago. So there's a local tone Autumn Indian. His name is Rupert and seen us and if you want. He'll do a sweat lodge for you. Sweat the Sweat Lodge ceremony, so I said, well what is it? Tell me what you know after the retreat we could do this? Sweat lodge so as well? What's a sweat lodge describe it to me, he described it. Made sense, I could see how it would fit with Buddhist practice and he said. Rupert's a pipe carrier. He's road man in the Native American Church, which is the peyote E religion, which is the North American version of Ayawaska. Basically is a sundancer I said, well what's the Sundance and he described that sort of made sense to me. So we had the sweat lodge and I remember so that was my first lodge and. So it's it's out on the rez and there's there's no technology. He didn't even have electricity in his house at that time I mean. Now he's got a cell phone and you know You Tube segments. And things like that. But you know. Things change right, but back then. He didn't even have electricity I was and. So anyway. So I remember There is this point where? You know you open the flap and he was running it. The Lakota way. There's different ways of running a sweat lodge. He was doing it. The Lakota way. So the Lakota or eastern Sue. The person that pours the water sits at the at the door. So he opens the door. All this team goes out there is the pristine Sonora Desert. Without any telephone minds or cars or anything, OK, it look the way it looked 20,000 years ago and the Suns coming down. And. It's sort of glancing raise he's full blood Indian just classic looks like something right out of the Smithsonian Institute. So is this profiles long hair. You know 'cause. He can braid your hair in the ceremony. Rights has got the long hair and like Classic Native American features and you could see. The sun was revealing a chest full of piercing scars. From the Sundance like. He'd Sundance 16 times at that time, and that was 3035 years ago. So. And it was like. Oh my God. This is a time tunnel that were being allowed to enter. To experience what are? Really remote ancestors experience. And it's like it was just amazing to me. And. When I got out, I remember crawling out it was pretty. Hot Lodge. And. I remember the first thought that went through my mind. Oh, this is what they call. Quote Primitive Religion 'cause Shamanism used to be called primitive religion and the reason for the air quotes is. Up it was so advanced so subtle so multi leveled so cycle. Spiritually sophisticated weaving group therapy into prayer into the power realms into purification through equanimity into being forced to concentrate because you just can't do anything but concentrate. So it's like Oh primitive religion and meaning of course. That when the Europeans came here. It's true that metal acts is a more advanced tool than a stone axe. But I guess they assumed that because the physical technology was primitive quote primitive that the Psycho spiritual life of those People as primitive it. It was it was the very antithesis of that, so anyway. That was my first encounter with shamanism. And I'll be seeing Rupert again next month. When I go to Tucson 35. However, many years later we're still doing ceremonies together.","title":"SHAMANISM"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/shinzen-approves-of-richie-davidson-s-vision/","text":"One of the main laboratories for affective neuroscience neuroscience that is looking at human emotion is also one of the main laboratories for contemplative neuroscience. Both of those terms affective neuroscience. The note of science of human emotion, and contemplative neuroscience, which is turning the lens of Science Twords contemplative experience. Both those terms as far as I know where. Coined by the same person and that person's lab is one of the main places where this kind of research goes on and who is that person and where is that lab? So Richard Davidson at. With the University of Wisconsin my alma mater. Actually, I did my undergraduate work at UCLA and Asian languages. But I did Buddhist studies at the University of Wisconsin back in the day when it was still weird to be interested in Buddhism. Um. But things were beginning to change, so there was no contemplative neuroscience at the University Wisconsin in 1970. That's all of course, much, much later. But there was Buddhist studies. You wanna know why the University of Wisconsin in my day was the Premier. Location for the academic study of Buddhism, the how to it's like wiscconsin. Why wiscconsin of all places. I mean, you might think Berkeley or Harvard or something? Why was the first PhD program in Buddhism at the University of Wisconsin well it's a nice little example of what in Buddhism is called Patita Summit, part of the causal net. This being that is this being that is this being that is. Leads to some interesting consequences. By the way it was a magic time. Let's see I must have gone there in 68. I think is when I probably that's right 1968 Madison 68 right. Well, you know it was crazy right means like the Vietnam War was raging my Buddhist education, 3 years of Graduate School. Paid for by. The DOD. The Department of Defense of the United States government. Why? Why are they? Why are they giving out like huge endowments to study Buddhism? Yeah, they realize there was there were political consequences to Buddhism, in SE Asia. Now there are political consequences to Islam. So there's lots of money if you want to study Arabic. Well, there was a lot of money available. If you wanted to study Buddhism. So, yeah, the Department of Defense paid for my PhD education in Buddhism. An and I paid them back by. Being in all sorts of anti government demonstrations. Which Madison was very famous for if you know the history of the time? It was pretty wild. I mean, I didn't do violent stuff. Some People got really violent that blew up one of the buildings on campus. I don't know if you remember that history or whatever it's pretty crazy. I loved it and we got one of our People dope smoking hippie elected mayor. And Yeah, it was pretty interesting time and that's that's where you could you would get a PhD in Buddhist studies? Now, if you look around the People that are now retiring academics. In Buddha's in the Buddhist field. Those are the people I went to school with. So I see these books published by this one and that one is that I remember he was like really crappy in Sanskrit. I had to help him out. It's sort of fun, but I didn't go down an academic course. I got shunted as you know into something else. But I still have those song scars. So you guys have to put up with dozens of languages and all sorts of. Arcane factoids that I find amazingly interesting and it's probably pretty irrelevant to a lot of People but anyway, so Madison when I was there. There was no there was no contemplative neuroscience. But there was Buddhist study. So why wiscconsin Alf? What arrows can you line up that .2? Wiscconsin of all places being the Premier location for Buddhist studies. 1st in North America. Like doesn't seem to quite compute. So when you think of wiscconsin besides the Green Bay Packers what else do you think of? Your take of cheese. Um and why do you think of cheese and by the way it is related to cheese? Well dairy there is part of farming and the University of Wiscconsin had the best agriculture programs. It was specialized in agriculture science. Because big agriculture state. So there is a science specialty in in agriculture now. The country of India has had a perennial problem. And that perennial problem is feeding itself. So. Lots of People came over from India to study agriculture science at the University Wisconsin. So now there is a general tendency in the academic world. If you have a lot of People from a certain region of the globe. For whatever reason are coming to your University well. It also sort of makes sense to have area studies for that region. At that University case in Point USC. What is USC's specialty as far as? Area studies. Huh. I know, but Uhm well it may be different now. But in my day. USC was where you went for Islamic Studies Middle Eastern Whi because salada wealthy people in the Middle East could buy their way for their kids into USC. So we have a lot of People from the Middle East and you had a lot of money coming from the Middle East. So there's Big Center for Islamic and Middle Eastern Research. At least, there was 30 years ago when I used to use the library there would be this big Islamic center, so it made sense because we had a lot of People coming from India to the University of Wisconsin well. Let's make Indian studies, not Indian in the sense of American Indian but E Indian so. Indian studies studies of Indic civilization and as People be got interested in Buddhism. Well, that is a product of India, so Buddhist studies. Makes sense at the University of Wisconsin because it has an area specialty in India. So yes, cheese is responsible ultimately for. All of this esoterica, these weird languages that you have to endure me talking about 'cause I went. I was in a PhD program for Buddhist studies so anyway. Now, when we think of Wiscconsin. We have affective neuroscience and contemplative neuroscience? How cool is that and that's Richie Richie Davidson and some of you actually know him pretty well. Most of you know him by reputation. So the first time I ever visited Richie, the first thing he laid on me when he was showing me around his lab, which wasn't nearly as big as it is now because the Dalai Lama gave him a couple $1,000,000, there really doing pretty good, but he still had a pretty substantially at a whole building and he was showing me around and he laid out this vision that he had for what his graduate program. In neuroscience would be and the phrase, he used was a Science Sunca. Science Sangha Nice Yeah, a community of meditation practitioners. Who are were also scientist so so? I don't know if it was required. But certainly everyone that I knew that studied that was a nuro scientist with Richie's program was also a meditator so the idea being that. It's not just well, we need to understand these experiences so we have to Meditate, but his idea was that this is going to make us better People and specifically better scientists. So that's like. That's a model right there, it's actually happening something that meditation can bring. If I didn't have all these other responsibilities if I could. You know just if I had a lot of spare time what I would probably do is. Develop meditation courses specifically aimed at geeks and scientists. Site just bring that in so. That's something that. There. Enlightenment or meditation can give to science that will help science do its job better.","title":"SHINZEN APPROVES of RICHIE DAVIDSON's VISION"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/shinzen-dave-take-a-break-from-the-brain-study/","text":"YouTube.","title":"SHINZEN & DAVE take a break from the BRAIN STUDY"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/shinzen-defines-enlightenment/","text":"Question yes, you could you could find which mean by enlightenment in this case history metric stream entry to find that for long, long, long piece on the Internet on my YouTube channels, but you would like the executive summary executive summary is.

No just comfortable whatever lengthen your spine let your whole body settle close your eyes? And. I'm going to briefly describe some options as to how we can work. And then you can choose which one you want to do. So 1. One thing that we can do, I'll go through a brief description of the five ways. And then I'll let you choose. Yeah, you can keep your eyes closed just sort of be settling in and sort of. Digest the information, I give you and then you can choose which of the focusing methods. You want to do so one of the ways is focus here and that involves? Observing your thoughts and emotions by dividing your subjective experience into feel image talk so that's emotional body sensation mental picture and. Auditory thoughts self talk that kind of thing, so one of the methods. We can use is to break your emotional and in general, your subjective experience your thoughts your feelings your reactions and such we can break them into manageable pieces and sort of like divide and conquer. So that's focus in working with your subjective experience. Alternatively, we can explore the power of now, by doing the opposite letting go of feel image. Doc and anchoring yourself in external sites external sounds and physical type body sensations touch sight sound. So that's always the present field image talk might be memory plan fantasy but touch sight sound are always now you probably heard of the power of now, so that's one way to experience in a tangible way the power of now, is by focusing out on touch sight sound so that's two possibilities focus in field image talk focus out touch. Sitesell another possibility. We talked about earlier is focus on restful states to sort of cool out. Another possibility is to focus on how things constantly change the dynamic side of experience how things flow and vanish will call that focus on change. And so you can focus in focus out focus on rest focus on change or the final possibility is that you can intentionally cultivate positive states. Of thought and emotion, so instead of just observing fee limit stock you can proactively create positive feel image or talk and then sort of radiate that positive iti sort of the power of positive thinking kind of thing will call that focus on positives. So those are the five ways. They are fundamentally contrasting strategies. And I'd like you to choose if you'd like to focus in focus out focus on rest focus on change or focus on positives and then I'll guide you in that regard, all of those could be good for working with stress. Yes, each in a different way.","title":"Shinzen describes all '5 Ways' before Guiding Steph"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/shinzen-describes-his-interactively-guided-web-program/","text":"Yes, I'd like to request another level of training based on the grid.

I understand you had to undergo 100 day period in Sala Terry. Um. Would I would be very interested in hearing. You talk about that experience. That sounds like a significant event to go through. It was pretty intense, especially for someone who is basically scattered wimpy and easily bored I had to. Every day do 3. Bhongir inganna rituals and sometimes those would take an hour to sometimes they take up to 5 hours. And then in between there were many other activities and I only the only human that I communicated with was my teacher. Where were you I was in isolation up at Mount Koya so I was in I had a room where I would stay where I would sleep at night and then during the day I'd go to the Hall Main Hall of the temple and I would do the 3:00 ceremonies and then every three days. I'd meet with the teacher who would teach me the next step in the ceremony, so it's an initiation process. And some by the end of 100 days. I had learned all the basic ceremonies of the Japanese Bud Rihanna practice on the surface, they look like? Making. Offerings to deities, but in the depths what goes on is that you. Visualize yourself as the deity so you replace your body image with the image of the deity. You replace your internal talk with the Montreux Video T. You. Make gestures with your hands called Moodar's, which impacts the physical body and then you create the feel in the in your body, the emotional quality of the deoti you doing, all these simultaneously. But all at the same time, so you've got the physical body an emotional body. Helped by the mood rise. Mecca you well. Yeah, that's the point. You've got replace your personal internal talk with the monitor of the DTN plox space. Then you visualize yourself as the DT so you replace your own personal image with the DTS image. Now, since we identify with body and mind. Whatever goes into the brain in the place where body and mind experiences processed the brain says this is who I am. So if you replace the physicality an emotionality of your human self with that of an archetype and you replace your mental images with that of the archetype and you replace your internal talk with that of the archetype you become the archetype your identity shifts. From your normal human existence to this other thing now. This is not insanity has to be distinguished from 2 states in Saturday and show monic possession. It's neither of those it's a systematic process. Designed to bring about classical enlightenment, but in a way very different from early Buddhism. In early Buddhism. You would break things down. This part is the physical body. This part is emotional body OK, you break things down into the pieces and then you would see Oh I'm not these pieces. In Vajrayana, what you do is you work with the same pieces, but you intentionally create mythical versions of them. Notice that when you do that, you become that and that gives you the exact same insight. In other words, in early Buddhism. You got insight into the arbitrary nature self identification. You would come enlightened enlightened means that your identification processes. Elastic you're nothing particular so you're going to be anything. So you're everything but you're also the nothing that's a source of everything all at the same time. In early Buddhism, they did that by dividing into pieces and then seeing uh. None of these but in Vajrayana. You create a mythical version of it. Notice that your identity shifts and then when you drop that your identity shifts back to the human but you realize that it must all be arbitrary. So the transition is where the end site comes does it depend on which deity you pick? I mean, you know it's an actor, you're envisioning other People and you're putting it in your body and you know, but it's not a deity so I imagine? What deity you're picking would affect the experience or is it simply doesn't matter what you're picking it's very interesting how they do it. First they teach you how to do it with a wide variety of deities over that one hundred day period, you get to explore. Many archetype pick your favorite video well. Not quite but you explore compassionate deities. You explore wrathful deities. You explore avataars of fear, you explore compassion and so forth. After you've had a chance to explore all these identities. You get when you complete the training then you get your full initiation. And at the full initiation, which lasts all night. They take you blindfolded in front of this giant model that has all the deities of the universe. In it, they give you a flower and you hold the flower and. You would completely disoriented. And you drop the flower whatever flower the deity falls on your master calls out the name of that deity. And that's the deity that is your Easter Dave Attel That's the deity that is going to be the one that has been sort of selected by this process. Are you allowed to say? What your deity was or is that a secret thing? We're not allowed to say, but It's it's a very interesting process yes.","title":"Shinzen Describes the Vajrayana Practice"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/shinzen-guides-a-meditation-for-pain-part-i-of-iii/","text":"I'm shinzen young and this is my name is Richard Ford. And I'm going to demonstrate how to interactively guide a person in working with the issue of physical discomfort. Richard would you prefer rich rich would you say something about the? What you're experiencing now in terms of physical discomfort pain and so forth all the physical discomfort is in the lower back. Both sides extends down to the hip on the right side. And then occasionally it's shoulder stiffness and I think it's associated with the back pain in the lower back and is this a condition that with you. Like most of the time or it's been on and off for 20 something years. I see so it's a longstanding conditions is it something that represents a major impediment in your life or more just sort of inconvenience. It's an inconvenience. But it has been a major impediment. So it's sometimes flares and becomes worse and then other times, it's not so severe. OK, what we're going to do is I'm going to just start guiding you and you can just follow along and we'll see where it takes us so I'd like you to start by closing your eyes and you could sort of lengthen your spine and settle into your posture. OK, good. Now do you feel pretty settled into the posture? Yes, OK God. Will call the areas where you feel the discomfort clearly the primary areas. And I'd like you to focus for a moment on those primary areas. And. Get a sense of the size shape position and so forth. Able to do that. And is it 1 connected area, or is it several disconnected areas that are the primary. 2 areas to independent areas, OK good. Now I'd like you to check out and see if. The physical discomfort in your body is limited to those 2 primaries or whether the primary areas in some way affect the rest of your body you can do a sort of. Conceptual experiment you can imagine if there was not that primary discomfort with the rest of your body be in some way more comfortable if so, then that represents a spread of influence from the primaries. But if that's not the case. Then there truly isolated and there's no secondary spread. Can you make a guess as to spread there's a subtle spread does it affect much of your body most of your body or? The spread is not too wide most of it, OK that is by the way excellent spatial resolution very often when a person has discomfort in their body. Most of the suffering will be in the subtle spread People tend to think it's in the local intensity and sometimes it can be, but subtle is significant. I often say, and the subtle spread. The fact that you can detect that subtle spread is highly significant. So that's excellent. So. Here's what I'd like you to do. I would like you to work with the not let the primary initially but with the subtle spread. We're going to work with the easier material 1st. And I'd like you to let your attention freely float within the secondary sensations. And just sort of note the part of your body like knee face arms that kind of thing where there's secondary discomfort. And because that secondary discomfort is mild, relative to the primary discomfort. You may be able to have perfect equanimity with it just totally accept it. You may not be able to totally accept the primary sensation. But you may be able to totally accept the secondary sensations. 'cause their milder does that make sense so I'm going to have you do that with spoken labels. I'd like you to do that now. Smoking labels In other words, you'll say out loud knee face your note. You let your winners freely float within the secondary sensations. Go wherever they want and just say out loud, where you're focusing on the secondary and that will tend to sort of circulate through your body you'll see your your awareness was just sort of naturally go from place to place within the secondary does that make sense good would like you to do that with spoken labels and. I'll just listen in. Right. Shoulder blades. Neck. Muscles. My fingers to make it more impersonal and matter of fact you can just make it like really simple like shoulder. Finger. Neck in a sort of gentle and matter of fact voice so you don't have to make it my or like you make it like really simple and sort of impersonal and matter of fact. Forehead. Forearms. Psalms. Mac. Spine. Lower back. God.","title":"Shinzen guides a meditation for Pain.  Part I of III"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/shinzen-guides-a-meditation-for-pain-part-ii-of-iii/","text":"No. Slow down the label just slightly to give yourself more time to sort of soak your awareness into that. Secondary sensation. And if there's no secondary sensation of all the secondaires disappear, you can use the label nowhere. But if you're drawn to say your whole body like it seems to spread through your whole body and you're aware of that, then you can use the label whole body. Thumbs. Or head. What was happening during the silence there? Were you focusing in the same location? Felt like whole body but it wasn't enough to say it. I just suddenly the whole body. Subtle is significant definitely if there's a hint of whole body say whole body. And just open up the whole body to it. So if guessing and groping is OK by the way it's perfectly OK to make a gas. Any questions, so far, it's a whole body. Now there's a lot of whole body. Yeah, OK good. It may be always whole body that's actually it does it seem like it wants to do that? When you say whole body zoom out and cover the spread you know how. If you If you have a local pressure and then you let it spread out that will relieve the pressure if you let those secondary sensations spread over your whole body. You may find that that dissipates some of the pressure from the local intensity after enough time that's the purpose for opening up to the possibility that it spreads over the whole body, so that's X once again that's excellent spatial. Resolution by resolution I mean ability to be clear about what you're detecting so if it seems to be a whole body and it's over and over again whole body just zoom your attention out cover the whole body and just let the sensation ripple and radiate out into space in all 6 directions out from your body does that instruction makes sense excellent so now. I'd like you to continue using the spoken labels once again, I'll just be doing my own. Practice why you do that. Hips. Forearm. Ankles. Whole body. That's perfect. By that I mean, the tone of voice the pacing and the wording are all perfect. Once you establish this awareness. The rest is just a matter of time. The tone of voice indicates that you have a quality that we call equanimity. The pacing of the labels guarantees that you're highly concentrated. And the wording of the labels guarantees that you're bringing sensory clarity to the experience in this case, the sensory clarity. Is the precision with regards to the location of the secondary spread sensations? Does that make sense? How what you're doing develops those 3 qualities? Once you have a momentum of those qualities, then it's just a numbers game, you are setting the stage for nature too. Break up the suffering. From this experience, it could happen in 5 minutes or it could take 5 months, depending on the depth of the challenge. But you I can tell by the way that you're labeling that you have a momentum of concentration clarity and equanimity. Once you establish that momentum. Then the rest is just keeping it up and letting time pass does that make sense excellent now I'd like. You could continue to do that, once again, I'm just going to do my own practice for a few minutes and we're going to give nature a chance give some time for it. Any questions about what we've done so far makes perfect sense excellent. Hang with that for a minute and then I'll touch base with you again in a couple minutes. Eyes. You can label a little bit more quickly just a bit more. That will help with concentration a little bit. You can repeat the same label again. Ankles. The. Whole body.","title":"Shinzen guides a meditation for Pain.  Part II of III"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/shinzen-guides-a-mindfulness-meditation-for-pain-part-iii-of-iii/","text":"Whole body. Or. God. Now I'm going to ask you a few questions. Would you say at this time that? There's very much mental chatter going on or it's more quiet in your head. It's pretty quiet. Would you say at this time that you have very much mental imagery going on or is the metal screen more in a blank state. You have images? What sort of images do you have images of your body or my body the body related images good that's a very natural reaction and once again excellent detection. Are the sense that we have a body comes about through a combination of actual sensations. In the body and then mental pictures of the body. So, just let those mental images be there, but in the background. As you focus on the actual sensations. Now we're working with the secondary physical sensations of your chronic discomfort. Chronic pain situation, I have one other question at this time are there any emotional sensations associated with this any qualities like impatience fear tearing us that kind of thing or is your emotional body fairly peaceful. It's fairly peaceful. K God. If you have a lot of mental talk or emotional sensations, reactive to what was going on which can of course happens. Sometimes that would be something else. We could work with, we could work with your feel image talk reactions, but right now, it seems like that's not too much in the way so we're going to just stay with the physicality of the body. Those secondary sensations that I'm having you focus on our do they seem more or less stable or are they more sort of flowing an like an enerji kind of thing? Are they more like solid and articulate like. Thing would you say there? They're pretty much. Solid there in there, I'm aware of them at all times. It just shifts. The awareness so you're aware dishes. But the sensations themselves? Don't particularly flow or vibrate as a kind of energe take it could happen on occasion that they do, and if that does happen that something significant that you can focus on it has that ever happened in working with your body experience that it became fluid yes. OK so you know what I'm talking about it's not happening now and it doesn't have to happen. But if it does. That's a significant experience that I call flow and you can go with that, if you wish. OK, I'd like you to bring your attention to back to the primary area. The two primary areas where we started. It's possible that those areas are. Exactly the same as they were before in terms of intensity solidity and so forth. It's also possible that there's been a change, they might be more intense less intense more solid less solid you know more. Sort of. Coagulate eed or more thinned out would you say that the 2:00 secondary areas are pretty much the same as when we started or have they changed in some direction. Can you describe the nature of the change will not even aware of them at the mall and they've sort of vanished. Remember I mentioned how detecting and totally opening up to the secondary spread could sometimes dissipate the pressure from the primary. Remember, I mentioned that well, you just experience that it's pretty cool isn't it has that ever happened to you before like this, not like this? Did you ever work? But the secondary sensations? In this systematic way obviously OK? Well then I would say you learn something pretty significant and in a relatively short period of time. You can open your eyes if you wish and just sort of stay with the momentum of that. That was excellent work. Any questions about that experience. The flow when I said solid. It seemed to me, then when I as soon as I said at the start of flow around Oh. I see just thinking in those terms class? Can you still be aware of it as we're speaking? Yeah. Stuff like and moving all over yeah, so now it's sort of turning into an enerji experience and even the secondaires are not that uncomfortable, yeah well. You can remember what we did. Remember, the strategy. 'cause a lot of it. Remember I asked you. A lot of questions and that was in order to pick. An optimal strategy to start with and based on what you told me seem to be OK. We'll go with the secondaires see what happens and two of the classic results. The dissipation of pressure from the primary and a sense of Fluidity occured in a relatively short period of time, so we were lucky in a sense. It doesn't always quite work that easily might take hours or even days, sometimes, but we sort of looked out. But you can remember it you can replicate this on your own. You remember the sequence that we went through, and you remember the categories. Their definitions and the ways of working with them? Well, that's very cool. Any questions or other things, you'd like to comment on got anything more. The first ones always free will be a charge for the next one. I was terrific well very good, so there, you have actually I gotta be honest, it doesn't always work. This easily but there you have a classic example of how what I call an interactive. Algorithmics guidance it's interactive because I took feedback. I ask questions. Its algorithm it because I was following a flow chart in my own mind, I have. A range of strategies that involve looping and branching and depending on the kinds of answers. I would have gotten we would have gone in very different directions. If he had a lot of thoughts and emotions about what was going on. We probably would have started with that, etc etc. So this will give you an idea of the approach to mindfulness that I call interactive algorithm ECB personalized coaching. My contention that this way of working is the optimal way, both to teach People. The skills and also to support them when they have to apply those skills to real life challenges such as emotions or physical discomfort. So thanks rich that was great. We got it for the record your V mean excellent extraordinary very good well. We don't call it the miracle of mindfulness for nothing. If you look back you'll see that I didn't have your change anything at all. That's what's so weird about it all, I had to do was be precise concentrated an matter effect. We didn't try to change anything or make anything go away. And yet because of bringing that threefold skill set to this experience. Suddenly, there's a reduction of suffering and even a little bit of a pleasant kind of energy associated with it. That's the miracle of mindfulness.","title":"Shinzen guides a mindfulness meditation for Pain.  Part III of III."},{"location":"shinzenvideos/shinzen-guides-steph-in-focus-out-sight-sound-touch-shinzen-young/","text":"The focusing out sounds interesting, so does the positive but I think the focusing out sounds very interesting OK good so you'll remember I said that we would very carefully define terms so. External sounds right will call sound. External sites will call site. And then physical sensations in your body will call touch. So I'm going to describe a technique Ann. I want you to tell me if it makes sense. If all you're aware of is touch. I'd like you to say out loud touch and focus on that for a second will call that noting. If all you're aware of is touch, not touch if all you're aware of his sight, not site. If all you're aware of his sound old sound if more than one is available just choose one to note. It doesn't matter which intently focus on that for a few seconds and then. Note again, either the same thing or something else does that make sense are mine. I suppose to be open. They will be in a minute, but I will because we're gonna site, you mean with external site that's right. But I wanted you to prepare with your eyes closed just to get settled. So let me just repeat when I focus on touch. I'm focusing on body sensations, like sitting in the chair or. Close or just just at any sensation that's not emotional and that's touch sight would be what I see with my eyes open and sound is now what's going to pull you away from touch sight sound? Is your reactions to it, which is feel image talk. $0.70 or my thoughts well. Yes, you're feeling it stock could take the form of reaction to touch sight sound or it could go off on its own and spin memory plan in fantasy. So. In your be constantly pulled towards feel image talk when that happens just let go of that and focus on touch side sound so it's sort of expansive concentration. You know the contractive world of thought and emotion pulls in and you work against that expanding out into touch sight sound. That makes sense. I expanding out you mean I'm moving your windows aware of like the outside world. Yes, letting go of the inside world. This will right so you like anchoring yourself in the power of now. OK, OK, the touches the sights and the sounds are always now, so that will weaken the gripping power of fantasy memory planning and judge mental illness. So. We're going to start to make it simple I'm going to have you just do touch and sound for a second and then we'll add site alright, so I'd like you to say those labels out loud. OK. Just when my awareness is on it that's correct OK. Touch. Touch. Sound. Sound. Touch. Touch lots perfect, meaning the tone of voice the pacing and the words the wording. That's exactly how to have both at the same time, but you're taking your selectively trying to pour your attention on just one that's the dividing conquer. One thing at a time kind of thing K cut now we're going to up the ante. Open your eyes. And include site is there a particular let your eyes. Just do whatever they want to do OK and now you're going to have 3 possible things OK well site is big. So so I'm just adding sites at that butt touches and sells Maple you also. Site. Site. Touch. Sound. Site. Site. Sound that's perfect now instead of saying the words out loud. Do it mentale. So you just gonna think the labels touch side sound. Able to do that pretty good, yeah. Takes all there's not room to do anything else, it takes over your concentration just to do it. So I think you could see potentially this would pull you out of obsessive thoughts. You can also see that you could do this in motion while you could be moving house work even when you get good at talking to People and you could still I'm doing it now as I'm talking to you and then you can think of what to say, well. Why don't we didn't get into it but it remember I said base level of concentration clarity? Eventually it just goes on autopilot on doing it now without having to make the even the mental labels. But I'm aware is it touch sight sound that I'm focusing on trying to do it. Yeah, yeah, so that allows you and I think you can see it built you feel like you're more focus right? That's the concentration using my whole sense of being here. I realize how much my sense of who I am is really you know, Oh that voice in my head is telling me where to go and you're going to be late or you know. It's all in here and kind of focused here and there's something about this that makes my whole sense of what I am bigger. You know as my awareness moves out there and like I said it doesn't leave room for my. Chatter my incessant chatter in my head it like takes a break. I I'm not aware of it until afterwards and obviously it's activated now again as I talk but. Yeah, that's the general idea thank you.","title":"Shinzen Guides Steph in 'Focus Out' (Sight, Sound, Touch)~ Shinzen Young"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/shinzen-s-30-second-samadhi/","text":"Hello.

I'm on to the single most exciting science research Prospekt of my career and my idea is right. Well, you'll see it will definitely see anything you want to hear the expansion and contraction on my idea, yeah, OK. Let's start with expansion. Should we start with let's start with the expansion so you know it's a big thing for me? The. What I called the philosophy of? The American philosopher Harry I don't know if you know her if you've ever followed. Harry it's got a weird first name, Dirty Dirty. Dirty Harry pretty much summed it up when I mean, you sexist language, but that was just his character after freaking him for that. But the single very important philosophical point that comes across from dirty Harry is a man's got to know his limitations. So what does that have to do with anything well? There is a general tendency for People that have deep and authentic mystical experience to make broader claims about that, then are justified I think. Don't don't get me wrong, it's still the best thing ever ever ever for our species. But typically People that have these kinds of experiences claim that they have a special knowledge of the ultimate nature of nature and they have the final answer for everything. And I think that that's irresponsible claim. And irresponsible claims may seem. Innocuous enough, but they can poison our relationship to the scientific world. Ah. Cousin science, but one thing you are not allowed to do is make you responsible plans. You have to have evidence and you have to have logic and it has to be when it has to be tested and tested in many locations around the world for decades, and decades before it's allowed to be called a theory. OK, so it's a big deal, so because I am very colored by. The philosophy of jury had dirty Harry which is the philosophy of science. I don't like to make irresponsible claims. Why am I going to say that 'cause I'm about to say something it's going to sound like the most ego maniacal Randy owes delusional claim that you've ever heard. We make but that's going to be the expensive side. Then I'm going to show you the contraction that it's really not what you what you might think. So I'm onto an idea that object ivli absolutely. Incontrovertible E is worth billions of dollars. I got a billion multi billion dollar idea. OK and that is not a unexaggerated clamp I'll stand by it. OK, but now you have to hear the contractive side whenever anybody says something what's the first thing you have to do is? What's your definition of X right? We talked about that over and over and over again so. By what criterion am I evaluating the monetary value of this idea is the natural question. Paske I'm evaluating it by the criterion of what? Of the way all science projects are evaluated what statistics statisticians call expected value or expectation value. And that is the value of success multiplied by the probability of success. OK follow him, saying that C expected value its basic statistics. So what I gave you was not the value of the idea of its successful. I gave you the expected value, the value of the idea if it's successful is vastly more than a billion dollars. So what does that mean? Yes, but probability of success is not really big? I give it 1000 to one now you might think well. That's a real let down. They call it blue Sky Research or moon shot OK. It's actually an important aspect of science is fact. Some philosophers of science would say that Blue Sky Research is the single most important kind of research to do in science. Uh. Projects that have a reasonable probability of success with a huge payoff. But one in 1000, is actually a reasonable properly every idea. I've ever come up with before has been one in a million one in a billion. Not very likely OK. This is better it's one in 1000. But still, it's one of the 1000 so do the math. OK, however, the payoff would be trillions and trillions in monetary it would change the course of human history. Can you can put a price on that just figure out what the price of the world is? And then do some nontrivial percentage of that some percentage of that. So anyway, I got an idea. And I've got scientists think it's reasonable and I've got People that are willing to pay for the research. So. That's really, really cool, but it's also. Something I have to devote some time to so there's that I've already told you what the idea is actually. It's actually on the YouTube. The last person that interviewed me. I'm laid it all out. If you're interested. I think it was the. The last interview meant that gasp gasp. Maybe that one. I was talking about 8th. I'm * on the Basal Ganglia. Neural modulation and that was the last time someone. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I talked about it at the end, one of the so. Uh. It involves my favorite disorder, yeah, I have a favorite disorder. It's a neurological rare neurological disorder. It's horrible don't get me wrong when it happens to People it's horrible horrible horrible. But it may have a huge silver line. Um for research and even for those People actually if my hypothesis is correct, you can look it up on Wikipedia. It's called a thym Warmia ATHYMHORMIA. Up. You can read a popular article about it in Scientific American mind 2005. The article has the rather intriguing title of the drowning of Mister M or no no, I'm sorry drowning Mister AM. Which is polacca Ath why well? Now, once again words and their actual meaning. I'm going to tell you the Greek origins, but that's not what the condition means. It's just what People called it So what does thymos mean in Greek THYMOS? I'll give you a hint this timea, you find me Alexa time? Yeah. It's what I call feel in or its emotion. Thymus is emotion. And what's horn made me I'll give you a hint hormone, they stimulate you. Um. So it's Uh means stimulation over motivation. A is an Alpha privative which means without so if you just look at the words. It seems to be, it seems to refer to a condition where there is no emotion or motivation a TH I'm or Mia. Here is a condition. Horme is motivation or gap motivation. Simos is emotion. So A is with us so the word seems to mean but does not in its essence actually mean. Our condition of of no emotion, and no motivation. OK. And the spelling ATHYMORMIA. Also, sometimes called a thigh performing syndrome is a syndrome, which is actually makes it interesting because it can be caused by a wide variety. Of. Lesions. In different locations and of different origins and they can even happen at different times in a person's life. But if they happen in just the right place on both sides. Of just the right circuit in the Basal Ganglia. You develop a caricature not stream entry. Lot of once returner. I love non returner. You develop a caricature. I hope you all here? What caricature means not the real thing. A bizarre something like. Are Hot Chip fall in love full liberation complete breaking of the identification of the mind body process total freedom from desire. And the ability to experience pain of any sort apparently without any suffering. And the ability to maintain. Total metal tranquility indefinitely. As a pathological state. With a well defined, physical origin. OK so of course under all neuro psych. Medical professional sees a * riffic disorder. Up. I see. A caricature of full liberation. With a known physical cause purely biophysical cause. And a biophysical cause that any first year medical student. Would immediately see an X Ray? OK so it's nothing esoteric in that regard, but the effect on the human being is bizarre. The other name for this condition is. Is much more revealing? It's mostly been studied by a handful of doctors in France. Ah and the French name is pop PAP. Parent. Go to active aseum see chic. Pad. Is Los? Bill. Auto Octave Ossium of auto of inner auto activation, they cannot boot Personhood from the inside Camera. Not enlightened person. Can manifest it or D manifested as? The conditions warrant and the IT is Inter activation. Up. People with this disorder. Are stuck on no self? Unless you activate them from the outside in which case in the most ideal perfect case of a 5. Warmia the lesions are not are like Goldilocks, not too big not too small if there just in the right just the right size and just the right in the. Classic. Case when you activate that person from the outside by speaking to them, they're completely normal. But unless you keep activating them within a minute are too they fall back to. Are sort of bizarre Noble silence? So. This to me is intriguing it is not a subtle. Then drowning Mister am is about someone who first noticed this condition, while he was swimming in his power. In his backyard. Um and the way he noticed it is that he no longer felt any need to swim or move his body. Now it's true his head was in the water and therefore he was breathing water. Um and he knew that he could turn his head anytime he wanted but breathing waterproofing error. Different is aware of that. He's falling sinking to the bottom of the pool and then he's dying. But being alive being dead, not so different is. Daughter comes out sees what's going on screams and reactivates his normal self preservation, he flails surface and doesn't die? Hence the intriguing title of the essay in Scientific American drowning Mister M. Send your book, yeah, maybe I mentioned it briefly well, I've been looking a lot deeper into it. A lot deeper and it's not an easy subject of a game to scientifically. Functional neuroanatomy at that level is not well understood. But in any event. Uh. It's a caricature. But it has some overlap. And. It's It's nothing mysterious or abstract. It's Grossly physical. Um. So to me the fact that it's stunningly dramatic. And that it has some overlap. Don't know exactly what the relationship is I mean, it is a disorder but it's overlaps. It not just one or two ways and overlaps in about 1/2 dozen ways. With what we're spending our lives trying to achieve here. On. So that combination of we know physically exactly what's happening and it has an overlap and it can happen within a week or a few minutes. Um. And it has an overlap many intersections with. What takes a lifetime to achieve? With practice is not the whole picture Dem. You know what I soon as I talk about that People they think I'm stupid or something they think I'm equating this with what we want or they think I think this is the whole picture of what we wanted not naive. But I am saying that something's really jump out in this. As Possible Research Ave. Um. Not so much to make. They have. Physical interview my paradigm is not so much. Oh, we're going to figure out a way to accelerate meditation. I'm much more grandiose. My Paradinas was going to simply make liberation part of standard Medison everywhere in the world. Uh. How could that possibly be? Well. Um. What what's wrong? What's the difference between a time Hormilla and being are hot? I told you I told you what the similarities are. But our Hut compacted him well. That's certainly one difference. I didn't hear that are hot can activate itself. If need be so I can show you the similarities. I could show you the differences. And then I can make some conjecture about how we may be able to. Get the baby and throw away the bathwater so to speak metaphor make sense the baby being the liberation of the jewel in the Lotus So what is different well clearly one thing that's different? Is see this is the condition is so. Is so? Complexing to doctors the few doctors that know about it or if researched it. It's very rare by the way very rare because, like I say the lesions have to be in exactly the right spot and exactly the right size. If there not big enough or not in the right locations. Then you won't get this dramatic effect if there are 2 big or in the wrong locations. You get a whole bunch of other effects that basically leave that person. Totally disabled and they you can't boot a self by talking to them, they have? What's called a kinetic mutism there. Just you can't see the thing about 8:00 time for me, it is on the surface. It looks like a kinetic mutism. Akinetic mutism means you no longer move and you no longer talk, but you're not in a coma. You're not paralyzed you're not sat even somnolent. Um you're not depressed. But you just no longer talk or move ever so you might as well be in a persistent picture. That's a fight. That's the extreme case of a kinetic mutism. That's when you get the lesions similar lesions, but they're too big. And then they just wipe you out, but this is expansion and contraction. It's just right so that it leaves. It leaves the possibility that just by speaking their back to normal without cognitive or behavioral deficit for about a minute. So you have to keep activating them. Of course, if someone were to simply create an app that talked to them all day. Presumably they'd be back to normal. And let's see who knows how to design those kinds of apps. I think I do. Up. So. Uh so one difference is you can't. We can't manifest self. I will let you are dependent on another person manifesting, drawing it out of him, but in the most ideal case. There are actually just normal OK for a few minutes. Uhm I actually have a student who was a neuro Psych Evaluator, who had this condition in a patient and he's one of my facilitators back E teaches neuroscience now actually but he wrote up a case study and he confirmed for me. Just on his anecdote that absolutely that's what it was like. The guy never complained. He's been a math Prof at one of the New York University is the patient. And if you ask him to deliver electron advanced math, you could do it just fine. If you kept him going. But if you went away it would just sit there and look at you wouldn't even wouldn't move all day day after day. That's Subtle Croquet and the size of these lesions. Ah. Rye screen. But bilateral or a few rice grains. Over the head of the Kotick nucleus will do this, if it's just in the right place. Wow, that's pretty dramatic anyway. One difference can totally dysfunctional, obviously so we don't want that. Um. So what are what makes up an integrated enlightenment well concentration clarity equanimity? Plus, wisdom you have a paradigm about how. You know about emptiness suffering self. You've got a view Adarsha nod. Bawa is it to betten say there's wisdom function. And then there's the ahold a mention of practice that might be called integration. Up the void the degree to which emptiness your own emptiness. The emptiness of the world is healthy, empowering enlivening fulfilling and liberating for U-verse is the degree to which it's not that yet. And some People have no difficulty integrating avoid some People have to work at it. Some People have to work. A lot harder at it every now and again, you get. The Dark Knight, where it's actually. Sort of catastrophic but still fixable but that's very labor intensive and may take a long, long time to fix that, so you have this whole spectrum of. But a dimension that might be called the degree to which the emptiness or the nothingness of self and world. Has been integrated it's functional? It's It does good things, so concentration power sensory clarity equanimity. Insight wisdom. And integration of the void. Might be one way to talk about dimensions. Of the practice so. Here's my hypothesis people with this condition. Have been. Bio physically. Uh have bio physically induced irreversible perfect equanimity. Or something like that. But it actually could be a good thing. The one characteristic in all cases reported is. They don't complain. About anything now are they actually OK, so doctors know how to do something that they call a mental status exam. You go on YouTube and learn how to do it. It's interesting. I did just for the fun of it. Because there are professional and it took actually many, many decades to figure out how to teach doctors how to do this. A quick mental status exam and it's very systematic is very clever. Like I say if you're interested just mental status exam on YouTube and you can get a little tutorial how to do it? Why do I mention it? Well, I'm a professional and I know how to do something called spiritual status examination just as well thought out and it's just as systematic. No one has ever done, a spiritual status examination on an 8th I'm * impatient. But I'm going to see if I can pull some strings and let that happen. Until then I can make a hypothesis. My hypothesis is. They have a physically induced profound equanimity. Up. Uh. And they probably do not have the taste of concentration or sensory clarity. 'Cause that has to be cultivated. And they probably do not have the insight. And they may they probably have not integrated their own nothingness, so they're probably lacking those 3 elements 4 elements is my guess. So the question is. And I'm not pretending I know the answer to this question. But if the answer happened to be in the affirmative that could be very, very good. But I don't have a clue, but I certainly know what the question is. Since these are all dimensions of a single gestalt. In healthy practice. Will the fact that one of those dimensions seems to be on Max? All the time. Would that make it easier for them to? Quickly attained the other dimensions. With interactive guidance because remember you can turn them on by interacting. So if they were given a little bit of interactive coaching could we re engineer this. From a bizarre caricature. To something like the real thing. Is there a potential for neuroplasticity in this condition? I have no idea? But I think it's an important question. Relations are static. Their permanent yeah that's a G and they happen that's correct well let's see. They may change size if they're depended on tumors. They it can be caused by a lot of things that's what's so amazing it could be caused by ischemic stroke. But I called the cuter in functions, but it could be caused by tumors in those locations those might change size. It can also be caused by carbon monoxide poison. Apparently, the Basal Ganglia are very vulnerable to carbon monoxide poisoning. Does even one case? Where was caused by a wasp sting from an anaphylactic shock? Happened for whatever reason to hit right in the right place in the Basal Ganglia. So they can be caused by various things but essentially yeah that it's. You know, so let us say we got lucky. Let's Say that There's a one inch 10 chats that there's some potential for training here that significant. That's just guess it might be 1 in 100. OK, so. If that were the case that would be interesting and good for patients for the few 100 People around the world that has this condition. We put it into an app for them and. Be nice but then we have to of course, ask bigger questions. Of course go bigger go home. So let's say we got lucky OK. Let's say it turns out that because there in perfect equanimity. They can acquire all this other stuff in a few weeks. Now. They'd still need an app to keep them like human OK, but the combination of that app. They afterward delivered 2 things it would keep them activated. And it would train them in what they lack. The paradigm the integration the concentration the clarity skills. OK let's say we Get Lucky and this works well. That's great for a few 100 People that have a rare disorder. But. Then I don't give this that. Even a high probability OK. That's low probability that this is so well. Let's say we got lucky and it turns out, it is, once the next question. The red pepper powder afraid what about everyone else. Well, now, we could of course through various means high intensity focused ultrasound for example, we could vision your brain and give me the app, but something tells me. But this is not going to get FDA approved. Yes, imagine, we want to take a healthy person and cause a horrific dysfunction that will cause their family to have to pay millions and millions of dollars to warehouse them for the rest of their lives and we would like human subjects approval to do this, yeah, well. Maybe in the 3rd right. But certainly not in the civilized world. Oh. Uh but let me throw out a very weird sounding word. And very weird sounding phrase that is not science fiction, but it actually is science is done. Is known you can look it up if you want? Uh. It's going to sound a little weird on a little oxy moronic. All the phrases virtual lesion. Now you say? What the hell is a virtual lesion lesion means? Destruction damage to tissue. So what once averse virtual leases specifically what's a virtual lesion and someone's brain. There are forms of Neural Modulation, which will temporarily down regulate or even suspend the activity of a certain region in the brain in a way that that no harm is done and the normal activity returns in a short period of time. That's a virtual. Up. They're not very controllable at this point in terms of precision location and so forth, but It is done it's done for basic science research and you can get an IRB for that. You can get an Institutional Review Board approval. That means a human subjects approval approval is done all the time. I volunteer. No, I've already decided which cranium is going to be the first one to go. Under the virtual scalpel. I guess which one so long, long tradition in Medison of doctors researching on themselves. Sometimes the results have been fatal out in are you going to hear that. How will you know washing my thing is I probably know better because I can calibrate the dose in the location would you lose the ability to calibrate? Not if they're talking me through. You can activate me Oh you guys are all freaking out remember. At the University where were planning on doing this will not give approval unless it is absolutely safe. I can promise you there's no University in the civilized world that is going to let anyone do anything on anyone where there's a potential for damage that is known that they so no one will allow me to do this and less. Save a very, very * * group of People have looked at it and said this is safe. This is not like you can. Just go off and do stuff OK, you have to get institutional approval and they have structures at their they are very, very conservative, as to what they let you do so don't worry. I'm not going to come back like Max headroom or something. OK, so. All. So the next question is. Can we temporarily induce it with virtual lesions? Probably not. Unfortunately. Because the virtual lesions are hard to control and remember, we're talking about surgical strikes here we're talking about cubic millimeter precision. So probably not. Too bad but let's give it one in town. Let's be generous. Well, it's number one turned out, not so one in 10 shot. And #2 turned out that someone in 10 shots and I will talk about a one in a hundred shot. Uhm but that would mean that we could take People. Put them in this state and accelerate their practice. Uh. That would be good for the meditator's of the world, but like I say my. Ambition is much, much bigger. Looks like. Everyone total it's like you do the whole thing we fix the planet or going. So. Up. The next thing you'd have to get very lucky. Is that the medical establishment realises that this is an alternate better way to do a whole bunch of things that they are currently trying to do. My treat addiction. Or manage pain. Or induce general anesthesia. Or. Cure depression. Remember people in an 8th to be depressed. You have to. You have to have negative ideations there's no such thing as being depressed without. Intense incessant negative rumination. People in in and a thigh ormc state have no rumination at all. They can't woman it even if they wanted to gotta ask myself. If we had safe virtual Athan Hormilla. And you took a depressed person. Man. Suspended. Their depression completely. For an hour a week. And we're guiding them and mindfulness practice the whole time. When that intervention is over would it have any effect. Pronounce but it's not a ridiculous question. Um. Maybe you get lucky. Maybe you got assured for depression. Now put a monetary value on that. Uh so we have to get lucky number one and we probably won't. But first lucky is the condition. Is actually? One of the enhanced neural plasticity for acquiring the other factors. You need to be liberated. Probably not, but Maybe. Then we have to induce it safely reliably controllably. Easilly noninvasively. Is there a way to do that now probably not but maybe? Then it would have to turn out that doing that. Turns out to solve a lot of standard medical things. We know for sure that people in an 8th I'm * Mick condition. Report pain even in even intense pain without suffer. In other words, they feel it, but it's they don't experience it as a problem. I mean, I meditated for a long time, but I. Cannot breathe water as easily as I breathe air. This guy did in a minute, just because he added to murder in just the right place. Um. So. Is this too? Have analgesia anesthesia. I don't know. But it's not in ridiculous question so 1st. We have to get lucky. The condition is trainable then we have to get lucky we can do sit. Simply reliably safely. Non invasively. Our controllably that's these are all big things and neuro modulation at this point. Might be able to do that. Um. So let's Get Lucky #2. And Get Lucky #3 it turns out that when you do this and it's not just a nice thing for People that want to meditate speeds up your practice it has. One but I'm guessing if it has one, it probably has a half dozen. A significant applications in standard Medison. Of physical Madison in psychiatry. Addiction recovery that's Get Lucky #3. Uh. Now, how do you compute the probability of the overall success? If it's contingent on let's say one in 10 chance of A. One inch app ten chance of he wanted champion chance of C. Once the total probability of success one in a thousand its case being 110. Gas is one of my guess is somewhere between one and 10 and one in 100 for each of these So what does that give us 100? That gives us that gives us a total probability of one 100, * 100, * 1, one hundredth what's that that makes it 100. If it's Town it's one town times, one 10,000. So one of the 1000 so somewhere between a million to one shot and 1001 shot I think is reasonable. All. But the payoff is still going to be in the tense of truth. So the expected value is just so that's pretty exciting. Yeah, you're lying number one. Necessary. Well, this season. Well, if the if it's not trainable. Um then. It doesn't, it's not a situation that can be used to accelerate spiritual growth. OK number one million the seating at possibly a normal brain that has a temporary deletion. Virtual region, I'm going to, I'm going to guess that. Because the only thing different about the person with the permanent lesions. Temporary lesions is one is permanent. There's no other difference in them. So, in the most idealized case of a fan harm, yeah, subjects with the condition. It seems to me that it might still be reasonable we could never number one fails. To find a hopefully not shins in first subject to step up and welcome Asian Yeah. I'm guessing since with physical and psychiatric exams on the most idealized a fine warming patient show them as being completely normal. It's most likely that there's nothing else, going on there. So that's a nice idea number one success. Oh no no actually now. You're on to something OK now you're on to what we're actually going to probably do I don't think I'm going to be able to get access to the 8th. I'm army of patients that's a big deal. 'cause it's too rare and you know, I don't think I'm going to be able to do that. So I'm going to, I'm going to make a hypothesis that it's trainable. And we're going to go right to the virtual vision, so you're absolutely correct and that you're totally. On on the mark with respect to my strategies. We want your brain. I like you so this isn't what I intended to talk about at all. We get it on Camera Camera got the record of it here. First it still between one and 1000 and wanted a million. But if we get very, very lucky. This is going in the Archives said. You could also I was there with the 1000 more views than any YouTube in the history of you too because. Oh. So that's my thing OK go bigger go home. If you ever got a Dark Knight in the brain. No. Maybe someone else has but what we did you get no self and then what we did capture at Harvard was a physical cessation? And one of the participants are real erode up where she was gone gone gone. For a minute or 2 and we captured that in an MRI scanner. We haven't even though it's been years ago. We still have not gotten around to analyzing that part of the data takes forever to analyze this data. But we did capture that but now we've never gotten a dark night well. I'm sorry. I just got carried away. I was just going to explain why I might not be answering your Phone. Now I filled in the details so you can maybe have someone carious whenever we could say well. Oh yeah, yeah. I mean, you won't see that much difference. Just maybe a little latency in my response with his mad scientist trip doing what he always wanted to do. Creatures control people's brains sorry about that got carried away, but I'm here your brain. Deep in your practice. That's what helps. Informs the base in the world. Deep in your own practice 'cause the more People that go deep. It creates a culture where someday. Some team of researchers will pull off something like this, if we can last long enough OK now company last long enough. That's a whole. Other thing I'm not going to predict you know if we're going to make it or not. But if we could somehow just hang on keep civilization going for another century or so I would say there's a high probability then. Some group of People will come up with something like this and then the world will change rapidly rapidly for the better. It's the it's the old Messianic vision, but not based on mythology based on logic and evidence. So anyway, so much for that.","title":"SHINZEN's BILLION DOLLAR HYPOTHESIS"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/shinzen-s-cyborg-teaching-fantasy/","text":"So there are some standard things that I usually say got another one OK.

It get him to tell you that story, now you know how my ears got asymmetrical. I'm not sure there's any deep Dharma too. It was in a car accident long, long time ago. And. We flipped over and like a little sports car. I was a passenger. We got like sucked under a truck. It can actually happen. It's like a triumph. It's a very, very light car. We're going from San Francisco to LA and. There's no Dharma in this story OK. Is there any Dharma in this story? Can I make you can make it in a sense? No there's no doubt. This is before I was in the meditation is like way way back in the crazy days. So yeah, but me and my friend were driving back from. San Francisco Daly and he just bought this car and um so I didn't want to use the safety belt. Yeah, I don't know it may have been back when it still wasn't it mandatory and he says. No there's no way that we're going to drive without having that same seat. Belledonne so put it on, he was. In a normal state of consciousness, I had decided to be in an altered state. Highly altered back in the day, we were living in hate ashberry so you get the general idea here. What did you tell us you haven't heard difficult. It's just like a weird story spin on it to be of any value to you. It's just God he did crazy ship. So yeah, it's like a couple couple hours down from San Francisco. We just got sucked under a truck and then skit out an? Fishtail and then flipped over and over again last night, it upside down. And, of course, the only reason I'm still here is that I had the safety because otherwise I only just been count. You know, so yeah, I'm just sort of tripping out on me. Electrical poles were like becoming sci-fi movies and. And then there's sort of like this rumble and then the next thing I was just nothing it was like. I complete retroactive retroactive amnesia. I was just there was this rumble and the next thing I'm looking up at a highway patrolman. And he said, You're right town and my friend comes over and he's all bloody and everything and he said. We have an accident. And uh and I think I said MI OK and then I thought I passed out. And then the next thing or I'm like get an ER and this doctors looking down at B and. He says your year's been torn off, but don't worry we could so it back on. Mind you the LSD trip is still happening. Do not stop it never did it was, it was never a bad trip. I said Oh great OK. A meditator I just got lucky I guess this week out and apparently my friend. The guy that was driving who eventually became an empty himself actually but he told me that we lucked out 'cause. The guy was a really good surgeon and you can tell that that you know it's like. If you couldn't quite tell which one it was, but he could still see the scar here from so. Uh. So there was there were some funny parts like my friend came up. He spoke Japanese he was American. I mean, it was non Asian but we've been in Japan together so he says to me in Japanese don't worry that the doctors looking right in your eyes because that with head trauma your eyes dialate anyway. They're not coming. Speaking with a secret message in front of the doctor right so it's a pretty good. One Direction, something pretty funny. So I had to be in the hospital, but then they let me out the next day. It was really lucked out 'cause freaking totaled the car. I completely destroyed. The car and neither of us to seeing any significant injury and my friend had the presence of mind to Bury all the drugs by the roadside. Despite the fact that he thought he had killed me. Conscious because the car was upside down not a serene scene. I have blessedly no memory of this at all. But so they keep you in the hospital. I'm just laying there at night, an I'm just peeking. I'm looking at the ceiling and it's like Flowers or you know it's well. There's the Darmok expansion and contraction is very evident so I I couldn't get to sleep right. So so I called the nurse and. You know, I can't get to sleep just like give me something to help me put the screen that she says. Oh no in cases of head trauma like this we never want you to be on any drugs. 4 hours sleep, so that's how I got asymmetrical ears. But actually I can work Dharma into this very minor way. Which is after that I started to have something there was no untoward consequences of this apparently other than my parents pretty much freaked out when I call them. But it was OK. and I had to clinical Ichi. They checked out, everything but I did start to have something happen that has subsequently. Happened you know from that time on which is it was probably a consequence of this. I don't know, but there's something called sleep paralysis, you probably experienced it where you? Uh. You really think you're awake and you can't move and then all sorts of sometimes of very weird stuff happens. Uh some People get Kundalini rising and said that they call it the exploding head syndrome. I had I've had that happen many times during the sleep paralysis thing. This like it's like someone sheared off a fire hydrant. You've ever seen what that looks like. Except it's going up your spine. And blasting out of the Top of your head so I started to have occasionally those kinds of experiences, but the really weird. Things were I would. I would have experiences where I thought I was awake and things had happened in the real world I mean, I absolutely was convinced that they had happened but then, when I checked reality with all People they hadn't happened. So I was having dreams that were so vivid that they completely fooled me. And that was a little bit weird, and then so, so some of you if you've ever had. This sleep paralysis that you know what I'm talking about now what's happened over the years is I eventually did start to Meditate, but the sleep paralysis thing still happens, but it's completely different because now I'm lucid. I I I know it's happening and I know I'm a meditator and so I can play with it and what I don't play with it, I. I just meditate in it, and so to explore does an altered state? But In addition to the exploding head syndrome and the. Dreaming that is so vivid that that that really sort of alters your sense of what might be reality. Like let's just imagine imagine if in 10 seconds. You suddenly find yourself in bed and someone's waking you up, saying, you had a dream. You were out of meditation retreat just imagine how jarring that would be. So that that happened a lot of times and that was sort of interesting 'cause it once again. I I haven't meditated yet. So I didn't have a context for this kind of thing, but it really does make you think like. Maybe this is just one really big dream, um, so anyway. That's Uh. And the other cool thing is I completely understand alien abductions. I have been abducted by aliens happened several times and it's The Classic. I mean, the whole classic thing there due bring in. In some extra terrestrial language. And, yes, it's true, it's true. I have experienced it myself, several times they do pro I can confirm that it is what they say that place that gets pro. The one little differences do you think I'm making this up? It's happened any number of times, but the one difference is I know what's happening in sleep paralysis. I I don't think it's but it's very, very vivid. It's actually the origin. This sleep paralysis. And then weird **** happening with you being like violated or in some way. Like being touched in a way you don't want to be touched, etc, etc. That is the origin of the word. Nightmare originally well. Night is night what the Hell's a mirror. It's it's not uh of female ECB wine species. Mayor is a demon and it may even be cognate to the Sanskrit Waremart, I. I'm not quite sure about that which is the. Demons or Devils in Buddhism, original nightmare was an experience of an incubus or succubus. These are like creatures that sit on your chest and or they prod you or bite you or do weird things that are like very uncomfortable and this goes back centuries and centuries. You can look it up succubus and Incubus. Those are the Latin terms for it, but nightmare was the Anglo Saxon. So this sort of being paralyzed and sleep in having weird stuff happening. That's there's a lot of cultural references to it, but each age interprets it differently, so in the Middle Ages, where People were superstitious in the Christian sense. They thought it was Devils and things like that, and nowadays People sort of have archetypes of sci-fi and space opera so they experience it as an alien abduction. So I know I know that I'm just in sleep paralysis. I I'm not I don't believe it is actually happening, but it's very, very vivid. It says vivid as anything but I don't know if this is true for other but I can I can tell you that? When when As I'm waking up. And as I'm waking up from the from this. I could actually watch the transition between the 2:00 realities. The one where there's these aliens and they're they're doing this **** probe thing OK and then coming back to? The current physical reality and I don't know if it's other People. It's the same or not or this is just me. But as I'm coming back to ordinary reality. The experience of the **** probe becomes the experience of detecting my pulse. In that region of my body. It's so apparently. It's that's a slightly uncomfortable sensation. If you're not vulnerable sleep. Like State and gets interpret at least that's my experience and it's always that so as I can. I could detect my pulse there? It has a physical basis and I guess it's just a very sensitive region that when you're in a sleeve state who is fighting this. Hilarious but if you do is it happened to you. I know it's very painful, it's hard to talk. Reveal why I see well. I tell you check to see if you can zipper back here. Because you just wearing a human suit, you're looking at that seems Plausable. Well, that is not a Dharma talk. They say you should tell stories so that's how my ears got asymmetrical and Holla. My mind about maybe commensurately worked. I don't know.","title":"Shinzen's 'Dharma-Free' Funny Story of his Car Accident while on LSD"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/shinzen-s-teachings-with-music-for-education/","text":"I understand that you have some programs that are based on your techniques that have started to be employed in various places and I wondered if is there something that you can share with us about what's happening with aspects of your basic mindfulness enters sometimes it a particular focus weather for pain or music or something like that. Could you is there something that you could share with us in terms of how your techniques are being employed? And maybe institutions or educationally or health facilities well. I think the two things that come to mind immediately are that other teachers are using my materials to teach meditation YouTube materials. So they referring there, capturing YouTube segments and using them in the curriculum and I think that that's being done. Both for People teaching meditation pragmatically in the public but also for People teaching courses on meditation in universities or courses that maybe like Buddhism. Asian culture comparative mysticism. That kind of thing where academic professors are assigning some of my YouTube segments, too. Supplement the supplementary materials so. That's that's one area then probably the most exciting thing is the development of music based mindfulness. For kids.

So just for the heck of it since I listen to your reports about your meditation for what it's worth it be interested in hearing my report about my meditations. Now, this is just one person's experience so remember so. The danger in this is to think well that's you know that's That's what shinzen does so that's what I should be doing, but not. Mount the case profoundly not the case. My. Standard answer to the question what how should I meditate you know what? What's my standard answer primer whatever works. Mom claims are made. IT systems have strong points and weak points and even a given individual may relate to one system. At one point in their spiritual itinerary. They may relate to quite a different way of working later on, so I'm not about to. Give I want to avoid giving the impression that there's a certain way that everybody should be doing practice. So I had a really intense, and unusual experience during the process as I was guiding you and meditation in your practice today. So I wasn't following my own guidance. I got off on this other riff, OK and So what happened was is. That I was. Sort of doing a version of outer see rest OK, so that's the like. Looking out, but not at sort of the D focusing of the eyes that you know about. But I did a variation on it. It was sort of like a combination of see out and see rest in the sense that I. I experimented to see. House with making a very, very small aperture. But just enough of an aperture that pretty vivid patches of color would appear OK. Um. And so it was sort of like see out because it was color, but it was right on the cusp of. This urge to look at it as an object right on the cusp So what I saw was this field of patches of different colors that was. The room and all you folks. And then and then I Sorta. Collapse the distance between me and those color patches. And those color patches where like paper, thin, but very vivid. It was like really you know it's interesting the word in Sanskrit Rupa. Is ambiguous it means both color and form? So it means color it means form, but it also means matter in the sense of Materi Ality and you have to be a little careful it when reading traditional Buddhist literature that sometimes. Like in the phrase Nama Rupa in this case, Rupa means matter as opposed to an AMA which is Mont. But in other cases, it literally means color or form, etc. So I was looking at Rupa in the sense of just patches of color. Uh. So it was like really vivid. Bright.

And there's 2 kinds of comma, but the one that's normally used is called Hugh to Donna. And the way that schoolchildren learn here. Dagama is they learn a pole. A poem that contains. It's syllable of the Japanese language once and only once. And that poem is traditionally ascribed to Kobo Daishi also known as Cucuy. And Cook I was the person who introduced xinggan into Japan from China. And. He. Developed his linguistics sophistication. Because he studied a little Sanskrit.

You've said things that I've not heard from other teachers about focusing on all these different places. I've heard People talk about focusing on the breath and the few things that I said, before, but you've now brought up all these different objects of meditation is that how what you teach is different than what other well. If I were to describe I think first. I'd want to emphasize how what I teach is similar to what the other People teach. But of course, we can you know there's lumpers in their splitters right world this expansion and contraction. This split or love? Well, you asked me to split but I would prefer to initially lump and then I'll split so the. I would say that. Well, I teach People to elevate their base level of concentration so from that perspective. I would be identical to any other competent meditation teacher. I work within the mindfulness tradition. Mindfulness can be called a kind of meditation if you want to in that it one of the things that it does is dramatically elevate your base level of concentration, but mindfulness has 2 other components. Mindful awareness has I think of mindful awareness as a threefold attentional skill set. So one of the components. We've already talked about it. Some length that's your base level of concentration power? Which I define as the ability to focus on what is deemed relevant at any given moment? However, In addition to that? Which. Any form of meditation mindful meditation or Christian centering prayer or TM they would all achieve that mindfulness. In addition to that has 2 other components or features that are strongly emphasized in our distinctive to it. One is I call sensory clarity, which you can think of as the ability to keep track of the components of your sensory experience. For example, to make that tangible when you're having a an emotional experience. What part of that emotion is mental image? What part of that emotion is internal talk? What part of that emotion is emotional feelings in your body to keep track of the feel image talk components of emotion. Specifically, an subjective experience in general that would be an example of sensory clarity or to know when you have an external sound the sound is one thing your feel image talk reactions to the sound or something else. And it's those feel image talk reactions that create the sense of and I listening to and it called the sound to be able to keep track of what part is sound? What part is my reaction? What part is site? What part is my reaction things like that are what I call sensory clarity and we give just as we give People exercises that specifically develop their concentration power. We also give People exercises that develop their sensory clarity. So that's that's sort of distinctive to the mindfulness tradition, then another thing. That's distinctive to the mindfulness tradition is a conscious development of what we call equanimity, which is a little bit of a strange word is not ordinarily used and in fact that's why we use it to sort of sort of give drain well, not to create an aura of Mystical Mystical, but to give People a heads up. Hey this is a technical term and it means something very specific and it's defined in a certain way. So equanimity sounds like being cooled out into attached but actually as we would define it in the mindfulness tradition. It's radical non interference with the natural flow of sensory experience, so if you have. Emotions in the body you don't push them down. But you don't latch on to them inappropriately either. It's a sort of non pushing and pulling a hands off. With regards to the flow of your senses which does not for a moment imply a hands off. With regards to the flow of events in the world. You can be very, very proactive and even pushy with regards to. Circumstances and conditions, but equanimity means that you're not pushing and pulling the natural operation of your senses your sense is defined as external site external sound physical type body sensations meant your mental images your internal talk and your emotional body sensations. You let touch sight sound feel image talk expanded contract as they wish without interference. Let me just make sure I. I get that right so equanimity is my experience. Thoughts and feelings and body sensation. How I'm experiencing the world in terms of sight and sound I'm just letting that? Happen in watching that kind of flow. I don't know like waves or something but that's separate from my wanting to do an action in the world to change things. Yes, In other words, as you become passive innocence. With regards to in the sense that you're passive in the sense that you don't fight yourself. Your train another way to look at equanimity is it straining your sensory circuits, not to interfere with themselves. So you could compare it to, if your sensory experience is the engine of a car equanimity is oiling. The engin so the parts don't grind against each other. Causing the Dow or well well it going for it can lead to an experience of Fluidity, but sometimes it can lead to an experience of solidity because you're willing to let things melt and freeze. There's another TS. This is going to be TS Eliot time there's another TS Eliot Line Mid Winter Spring is its own season. Between melting and freezing the soles SAP quivers. You have to be willing to melt an freeze the equanimity is equanimity with whatever form the senses take, but what equanimity does is it's a skill. Yeah, so it's another way to look at it is. It's learning to love every sensory experience as it arises but not to hold onto it inappropriately as it passes? How do you develop that skill I'd like that one everyone would because it's a good skill? Yeah, it's a good skill all have some equanimity. I concur. And why it's a good skill is you'll discover that when you have equanimity with pain. It still hurts but it doesn't bother you and when you have equanimity with pleasure. It not only feels good. It satisfies you. People think they want to be free from pain and to have pleasure. But what they really want is to be free from pain being a problem and to have pleasure that gives satisfaction and it turns out that the quality of equanimity. Does that so when you say yeah? I'd like? Yeah, it's like that joke it's like I'd like to have like, she's having that's right well. That's in the equanimity is definitely something and how People desirable highly desirable and in fact, more than desirable may be absolutely essential. If you have some physical and or emotional pain that cannot be gotten rid of by changing circumstances or biannual jesiah. Or psychotropics or whatever, then you've got a choice of either developing equanimity or being mired in abject suffering. So definitely equanimity is not only desirable it may be pivotal to making life worth living under certain circumstances.","title":"Shinzen Young describes Mindfulness Meditation - as only he can."},{"location":"shinzenvideos/shinzen-young-explains-a-in-a-whole-new-way/","text":"So I want you to see my favorite T shirt. I don't know if you really see it all that good, I have a whole blog about this. It's hard to miss really. Essentially, it's this concept. A big a inside a circle. So. You know where I got this T shirt. So this is crew swag. From The Avengers movie this gave me a lot of geek cred at the Buddhist geeks couple years ago. You may remember their first meeting. I was the keynote speaker and I wore this during the during the conference because the movie hadn't come out yet, so that's what did me. The credit card I had like like stuff from the movie before it was available to the public so I was over at their place? And he had all this crew swag so you could take whatever you want and this immediately jumped out so. You may or may not have an idea of why. But take a look it's a. 1st letter of the alphabet inside a circle. So just out set off any possible associations Buddhist Wise. And each. Good gas are not completely unrelated. Well, the circle called Ensle ENS, so you can look it up on the Wikipedia. The Circle is used a lot in set for the obvious symbolism of the list. That is also empty. For example, in Soto Zen. And actually some rings. I also when you sit use it with this moon drop this circular Modra. This is called the Dharma. Talk to Sumathi Muthaura. I love the name Dhamma. Talk to means the realm of the Dharma. The realm of the absolute somebody is somebody in this case concentration and moon throws a hand gesture so this is sort of like the cosmic Samadi hand gesture so. There's you know, I saw the circle immediately. It's associations and it's meanings. But what really jumped out was the letter, A in the middle of it. Um. It reminded me of something from the school of my original ordination. Which is Japanese shingle she got his Japanese factory on practice and as you no doubt no visualizations are fairly central part both in the Tibetan versions of Ledger, Anna and in the Japanese version and there is a. Practice that is done, not only by the monks, but by householders. The average lay people in Japan that are associated with the shingle in school, they're taught this very simple of vision visualization called Ajikan. So con means a visualization. It's the same con is in like cons along so it means contemplate actually comes a lawn means see the world's sounds, but I buy extension contemplate and so forth so that's this con character. G is the same as in kanji, it means a character So what does army in Walla? Is not just the 1st letter in the English alphabet 1 version or another of it is the 1st letter of the Greek alphabet Alpha. Uhm it's also the 1st letter in the Hebrew alphabet olive, which pretty much sounds like Alpha and that's no coincidence. And it's also the 1st letter in all of the alphabets of India. Specifically Devanagari, which is the set. Sanskrit alphabet used in North India. Ah is the first letter. So. This is not a coincidence. The alphabet is one of the most extraordinary cases of cultural diffusion known to anthropology. It was invented. Once there, actually is just one alphabet was invented once about 1000 BC. In what's now Lebanon Essentia Lee. Which. Was the center of Phoenician culture and the phoenicians were sort of the northern cuzens of the Israelites essentially the same language, Biblical Hebrew. Finish is very similar to that, so they invented this alphabet, Aleph Bet Gimel. Dalvin Havea outside in the Hebrew order and that diffused. The Greeks picked it up from the. From the phoenicians the Etruscans picked it up from the Greeks. the Romans picked it up from the interest skins. And we English speakers picked it up from the Romans. So web W, but it also went E. Um. As the Aramaic script, which is what's used to write Hebrew now. That's actually our meat. That's actually in the Aramaic version of the alphabet? Derived from the Phoenician and then it spread and became the Arabic alphabet used all over the Islamic world spread further E Aramaic script was introduced into the eastern part of the empire of Alexander the Great during the Hellenistic period and was modified and became Dave and operate the alphabet used for Sanskrit that spread down into self. India and the cultures influenced by India through Buddhism to bet fact if you sort of Squint Your Eyes and look at Tibetan. And you squint your eyes and look at HEB is sort of look similar that's not a coincidence as I totally amazing. That is not a coincidence to band script is derived from a form of Devanagari. Devanagari is derived from the sensually the same alphabet used to write Hebrew once you go back to the phoenician, but it gets more interesting it spreads even further. Um. So. Because mantras are important in Vajrayana, practicing you visualize the letters. You champ the letters. So when the Japanese picked up Bud Rihanna. Um with it came. Um. A knowledge of how to write Sanskrit in. And in **** alphabet. Now they write with a brush, but they write the letters of a modified form of Devanagari called Sedom alphabet. So to this day. Monks in my school. Learn how to write the mantras in the actual Indic script, not relying on kanji or Chinese characters are comma. Um. So that means that. All the way from Japan. In the E. To England and Wales in the West. That single alphabet spread diffused. So. The 1st letter of the alphabet is Ah or olive or a? And in the Sanskrit language as in the Greek language. Ah. Or on the same thing is negation. It's the negation symmetry symmetric asymmetric. Um think of any Greek word, and the opposite of it. The negative negation of it will have them and a butter some other examples. Up. Typical atypical great what are some other examples? Simply out, we use that one huh? Atheistic without feels without God so. The letter, A is the Great Negator. OK. So the content RG com. The contemplation of the letter, A? Is used? 2. Not at first to develop of course, concentration power through visualization, but then to lead you to the insight of the Great Negation? What is the great negation? Well, the button. Born state and what is the unborn state? Well, Yuval meditated on it? Many many times with my system? Gone OK, so I'll stands for gone as the source of all things it's The Great. The rich nothingness, the Nada The Nihill Nihill Parexel NTA. The nothing par excellence whence our sensory experience arises and whether it returns moment by moment whether we notice that or not, and as we notice it more and more were called more and more enlightened so it immediately jumped out to be that wow. This is a really cool T shirt because. It's got both the end, so which is sort of like the Zen symbol for. The rich nothingness and it's got the Ah, the Alpha privative. It's called the eh that negates symbolizing the primordial state of the unborn nahs. RG home to show they say in Japanese that the character are points to the original face. They don't use that phrase, but the before your parents were born you know there's an expression. Before your parents were born. Before your parents were born right. Before expansion and contraction separated. You have face. What was it? Well, it will be the face of 0, now wouldn't the primordial unborn. So I thought there's a lot of Buddhist meaning in The Avengers movie. So that was a piece of Kruse way that that I grabbed.","title":"Shinzen Young explains 'A' in a Whole New Way"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/shinzen-young-s-chart-of-human-happiness/","text":"OK. So. The human condition. Humanity in general. Each one of us in specific. Can be iconically represented? This way. So a lot of information stored in this. As far as I can see everything that significant. For an individual or us collectively is iconically represented here. So what you do is you draw circle and then you draw 2, intersecting triangles. They draw couple more circles in a dot and then we're going to make this into life scene. Spiritual life. Found 6 compartments. Then you drawn IEYE. See. Here feel the three cents modalities. On. There is inner activation. For each one of these. CN. CN right here that's your mental images. Here in this is your mental talk feeling. This is your emotional body. But there's also the physical senses see out the physical world here. Here out. Hear the sounds of the world feel out the physical impact of your quality. So you have the inner and outer visual somatic an auditory arisings. These are set are set are ordinary sensory experiences that create the sense of self on the inside and physical world on the outside and then from the viewpoint of site cycle spiritual growth. There are certain special states that are significant restful states. And there's visual auditory in somatic rest. Flow states. Visual auditory somatic flow and within the subjective activation there is. A particular proper subset. Of positive images positive mental talk and pleasant positive emotions the subset of our inner activation that relates to our human goodness is very important so that's positive. Also see here feel in out rest flow. Good. To go. 2 are the 2 sides of the spiritual source and go or gone is. The. Uh what happens when those 2 sides to come together and you have to get a complete source. But when there's complete source. There's no cell for the world, so the source breaks apart and in the cleft is born. The self and world at least as we experience it sensorially here. Jewish mysticism has a whole thing about simple soon. How has said and grew up the allowing half of God and the limiting half of God? Pull apart and create this cleft. Where in the world of Rise is very, very interesting. Paradigm and something we can actually experience. So. They add this is the world of sensory experience. Beyond the image is the mental talk and the emotional body beneath it. Is the Subs are subconscious mind? Which is as far as I can tell avast world of connectivity? Uh. Now in the object if world we have behaviors indicated by Little Feat. Probably walk. And they basically come in 3 flavors good behavior bad behavior on. Ethically neutral behavior this tends to be linked with three object if situations in the world. Desirable situations undesirable situations and sort of neutral situation so this is the law of Karma. I don't know that it's exact accountancy across lifetimes, but Certainly, there are 10 general tendencies what goes around comes in. And I think it's important to? Be aware that actions have consequences. Beyond our personal world of our personal behaviors and our personal situations is the real world. Whatever that is. Not sure I can give you a conjecture what the real world is I'm sorry do it well. But it's just my conjecture. This I know for sure. I have absolute confidence that this works, the way it works. But this is the world of sensory experience. The real world. In my conjecture is sort of like the subconscious it's a vast realm of connectivity. And you can certainly in your meditation practice get the sense that when this collapses. The Inner World of connectivity in the outer world with connectivity merge. Uh that's a whole other paradigm for enlightenment. Each immense sons there. Can you see it Phillip? Whoops. Yunnan's son, Chan. One line moment contains 10th contains 3000 worlds. Actually, 3000. 1000 World Systems. OK, so that's uh that's the tent. I in China. Whole other paradigm for enlightenment completely unknown in the West died out in China 2000 years ago. But someone had an enlightenment based on the experience of this merging with this and another guy also the audience cool very similar notion. YN is it has influenced the modern Vietnamese master ticket hot. When he talks about intervening that's that's directly from the lion in tradition and that's based on an appreciation of the similarity between these 2 things. But anyway that's a whole other deal. I like to work here. When you want to help someone. This is also useful to keep in mind. How do you help someone? Well, if you want to get a sense of their whole situation. Now you may not be able to do something about a lot of their situation. But it's useful. I think they have a sense of the whole situation. So when I am in a position to help someone. I figure out what their sensory challenges are like maybe they have pain OK and they have. But I know if they have physical pain is an issue, then I know that they probably have image talk and emotional reactions to that. So they've got a sort of sensor challenge, but I also think about well are their behavior changes. They need to make is there something that they need to change about their object if situation impossible, etc, etc. So I use this as a sort of matrix to remind me how to organize a plan plan to help that person improve their life. So I think of the sensory challenges. I think of the behavioral challenges. I think of the situational challenges and then I think of the various mindfulness approaches the focus options that can work with those. Uh and So that gives me a framework for. Suggesting. Treatment plant so to speak so. Let's look at what that treatment plan is in the most general framework. In the most general framework. We could say that the goal of mindfulness practice is total human happiness. And I have an icon for that is a square Smiley space. :) So. In order to understand total human happiness. We have to understand. Surface happiness and we have to understand what I call deep happiness. Now totally human happiness consists of surface happiness for yourself. Deep happiness for yourself. Helping others to achieve surface happiness. And helping others to achieve the packages if you're doing all four of those then or in some way. All fostering all four of those then I say you are experiencing total or complete human happiness. Now what most People call happiness. Is what I would call surface happiness for themselves? If you ask most People, you know what's what will make you happy. They'll talk about something that comes under uh it's only a very small part of what I would call a happiness. It's legitimate but I would call it surface happiness for the individual. And here is surface happiness for the individual represented iconically. So this is what People think they want. And, which they actually do want and legitimately. It's legitimate to watch all this. But what People really want is over here and it's sort of related this is deep happiness. And when you have if you can have what you think you want and what you really want then you personally are very happy. But not totally happy because. When you have what you really want as you'll see in a minute. You realize that it's related to what I was saying before you realize that you is cleaner than just one line and body, so OK. With respect to the bottom. Well, no actually let's start down here. Yes, the average person. What's happiness for you they're going to probably answer in this domain and I gotta probably answer. Down here. So this is like the sun's coming up right and this is like rain and lightning and bad weather. So most People are going to give you circumstances object if conditions that OK if I have. This this and this. I'm going to be happy and they got a name. Perhaps some objective conditions which if I can avoid this in this then I'll also be happy. So I have the job. I want by the relationship. I want I have the health situation. I want I have the financial situation of along. The right People are in power in the government where I live, etc, etc. These are all conditions and then I'll be happy. Also, we want to elevate sort of the shiny weather and I am able to avoid health problems that I'm able to avoid financial problems and the people in my life are not behaving in a way that I dislike etc. Etc then I'll be happy. Thank you get the general idea, it's a litany of. Remember our picture of the human condition, it's a litany of this. I want these good situations. I want to avoid these bad situation. So that's what most People will call happiness. But if you look a little more deeply. Object if situations. The reason they make us happiest because of sensory experiences. If I And as a success in a way that I want to be a success. What does that really mean that means I get to have the pleasant sensations of People telling me how great I am? A lot I know I'm going to have that day after day OK, so knowing that every time I think that thought that's a mental image. Anna mental talk and then I get a Smiley sensation that every time. Somebody tells me how great I am I get a Smiley sensation. So the reason I want to be a success is so that I can have certain pleasant emotional sensations. In my body on demand. A lot of the time anytime. I want to think a certain thought it feels good in my body, etc, etc. So really in the end situations. Are desirable because they get their desirable if they give us certain sensory experience in their undesirable if they give us? And opposite sensory experience, So what is the body think it wants it thinks it wants to elevate pleasant physical sensations and pleasant emotional sensations and it does. And that's fine and what it wants to avoid is unpleasant physical an unpleasant emotional sensation. What does the mind want the line wants answers to this or that? And it wants to avoid don't know. So that's all good. But what does the body really want? Something like pleasure, but suddenly different I call it fulfillment or satisfaction. What is it? It's pleasure multiplied by concentration clarity and equanimity. It's the degree to which the body has been trained to have complete experience of pleasure or a mindful experience of pleasure. Those 2 phrases mean exactly the same thing in my way of thinking so we think we want intensity variety of duration of pleasure, physical and emotional in the body that's And we do want that but we really what we really want is satisfaction from that pleasure and that turns out to be not just a function of the pleasure, but a function of mindful awareness. We think we want to avoid discomfort in the body and that's true and legitimate but what we really want is to avoid suffering. And it turns out that physical or emotional discomfort. Uh. Is? Only what turns it into suffering is lack of mindfulness, so fulfillment equals pleasure multiplied by mindful awareness. And suffering equals disk equals discomfort. Uh. Divided by mindful awareness so as the as the mindful awareness gets smaller the suffering is larger. Uh. OK. What the mind? On the surface wants is answers to a lot of things on the outside. What the mind? In the deep sense wants is. The ants the answer. What am I seeing here clear the light beams are pointing to lots of things on the outside here the light is shining back on its own origin. Seeing what it's always been plugged into. This is called enlightenment. Or wisdom. And actually what we need to avoid is not so much don't know mind. In fact, we can't avoid over the line sooner or later? Don't know mind gets us. First of all every answer that you get generates 10 new questions. You never thought about that, so the answers grow linear, but they don't know grows exponentially. So that's number one number 2. Contrary to what every mathematician and scientist would have ever thought in the past. It turns out that modern math and modern science. Have at their core. A tremendous appreciation of limits as to what can be known. Heisenberg uncertainty in physics. Google incompleteness and undecidability in mathematics don't know moves large in modern science and then. An important plays an important role. Uh. Thirdly. Sooner or later. We're going to get old and stupid. All of us were going to be faced with don't know. So it's good to realize that. Don't know doesn't have to be a problem. See here's like. Chaos confusion doubt in decision and a frown OK. This is, don't know as a problem conditional happinesses. Or surface happiness comes about when we can reduce don't know itself. But it turns out that unconditional hours deep happiness is related to the elevation or increase of an experience of don't know with a smile. Don't know with a smile. Is a meaningful is the meaningful experience of meaninglessness? That sounds oxymoronic, meaning contradictory in and of itself. Maybe sounds like just some sort of word game, but there is such a thing as a meaningful experience of meaningless nuts. And actually it comes about when you have a sensorially clear concentrated Annie quantumness experience of confusion doubt indecision and chaos. Then that experience actually starts to taste like? Something. That has meaning because you're working through the need to know. And that leads to a new kind of noise. So, in mindfulness practice you get the insights by observing. Careful observing and analysis. But in, then practice for example, at least Rinzai Zen. There is a certain amount of observing that's true but also there's this what they call koan practice. You're given a problem that you cannot solve intellectually but then your press press to solve it. But you can't and you're thrust into. Are continuous don't know mind state? Which at some point you stop fighting? And then a new kind of knowing starts to flow through you. So deep happiness is the experience of don't know how and empowering way. So you see the contrast. Get pleasure. Versus get fulfillment, which is a function of mindfulness. Avoid discomfort versus avoid suffering. A function of mindfulness. Then, answers to this, or that. By way of contrast get the answer well this is a function of mindfulness. Avoid don't know mine. Learn to experience don't know mine does and empowerment well. This is a function of my phones. On. Object now here's the object if world in surface happiness. That certain conditions avoid other conditions. The object if world in deep happiness is. Once objected behavior. The The Surface Happiness POV is I want this, I want to avoid this. The deep happiness point of view is well if I can improve this and avoid this unlikely to get this. So it's putting first things 1st. But how does mindfulness way in? Well, if situations are to a certain extent. I don't claim 100%. I think chance enters in probably don't know for sure. But in general, if circumstances are consequences of behavior. If we have a handle on our behavior with time on average is likely we're going to get the circumstances we want. However. Our behaviors are driven by our sensory experiences are mental image. Our mental talk are physical and emotional sensations drive our behavior. Mindfulness gives us a handle on beyond our sensory experience that gives us a handle on our behaviors. That tends to lead to. Surface happiness. And besides concentration and clarity and equanimity not only bring about wisdom mind. They also increase your normal IQ. I do not have a scintilla of doubt that my late 60s. Now I am. Incomparably smarter than I was in my 20s. Just smarter in the sense of regular old intellectual smarts. Why did I get smarter and smarter because of meditation? So mindfulness effects IQ. Uh I believe. Um. So it actually helps with this one. And you know if you have sensory clarity that can also help you solve problems etc. You make positive behavior changes Well, you're likely to have more health. And less physical problems, etc etc. So consequence of this these 2 can go up so mindfulness also has an impact on our surface happiness. I don't mean to dis surface happiness by calling calling in surface it has a role. Uh. So we want to get both so we want to increase positive behaviors. We want to decrease negative personal behaviors. That's the object if peace. In deep happiness. So. I should say, however, that mindful awareness skills alone may not be enough. To achieve behavioral changes there, they are very helpful. But you may need an awesome sort of object if accountability structure, like a 12 step program therapist. What have you for behavior change? In addition to the mindful awareness they potentiate each other? So that's Sort of what these symbols mean?","title":"Shinzen Young's 'CHART of HUMAN HAPPINESS'"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/shinzen-young-s-happiness-chart/","text":"Here, the basic formula. As you'll recall. Is? Mindful awareness. Leads to 6 factors. That constitute Let's just say it's for you. This is the happy pointing to you. On. There's 6 things that are thought of as being whoops. Let's do it surface 1st. Surface or ordinary human happiness. And remember it was get pleasure in the body avoid discovered in the body. Get various answers in the mind avoid don't know mind. In the mind get situations that you want. And avoid situations that you don't want OK. This ordinary happiness plus deep happiness. For yourself. Deep happiness you remember the difference, OK here, you want fulfillment. Here you want to you want to elevate fulfillment. You want to avoid suffering you want to get the answer. And you want to be able to experience don't know mind. As an OK thing. Uh. And then here instead of situations its behavior. You want a man to love cause and effect positive behavior cut down on negative object to behavior those of the object effectors ease of the sensory factors. This. Leads to a motivation. To help other People. And I mentioned why that is, and what form that takes so this is a love of the human condition. What I do there? It was the heart and this is the Chinese character for humanity. This is bodhichitta. This leads to bodhicitta in the Buddhist context. Which then leads you? To spread surface and deep happiness to others. And all of this, this plus this. And this. Equals total human happy. It's this plus this it's not just. Of learning how to get fulfillment. It's also getting pleasure is not just avoiding suffering. It's also avoiding discomfort is not just getting enlightenment answers. It's getting this too. These together the situations you want. So this plus this leading to this. Leading to this. You'll have to have happy in every way. So that's details about happiness.","title":"SHINZEN YOUNG's 'HAPPINESS CHART'"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/shinzen-young-tells-stories-of-yes-no/","text":"So. There are. Was famous? Master in the Tang Dynasty that in Chinese is called John to his name is John to. E Asia is a little confusing you know because there's four ways to pronounce. Every kanji every Chinese character there's Chinese way and actually it varies depending on the part of China. Then there's a sign of Japanese aside of Korean assignment Vietnamese. So if you want to look up Zen Masters. Sometimes you find the name under the Japanese pronunciation sometime under the Chinese so job Joe. In Japanese is pronounced Joe shoe. Lot of People think Oh that's the same as Sasaki Zhaoxu My teacher, but it's written with completely different characters. Um just happened to sound the same in Japanese. So John to or Joe Shoe in Japanese pronunciation was actually one of the major. Zen Masters of the late Top Tom Dynasty on he was a disciple of master not read. That's nonsense in Japanese burn ciation. Um non trend was a disciple of one of the sort of founders of Zen mods. Called fossil in Japanese. Nontron is famous. 4. A rather horiffic piece of behavior if you were to take things literally. But you know, these Zen stories. You cannot take literally right remember. They point but they also hook OK. The whole idea is to see what they point to but not allow your? Your fixations to get hooked by things so 'cause it when you hear this story. It's like Watt, so I don't know if it this story actually happened OK. It's a little hard to imagine that it actually did happen, but it does point to something. Uh. So this story involves Mount ran non sampled in Japanese pronunciation and John JoJo Jo was non trends the cycle. So John to was out. And. A dispute developed among Naturals students the way that the temples were organized in those days is that there was Eastern Hall in a Western Hall. So the monks in the Eastern Hall and in the Western Hall got into an argument about who owned a cat. This is a pretty typical of The Tempest in the teapot kind of stuff that we humans are subject to you may have noticed things like this happening, sometimes little things become big things. Uh. So you may have noticed it during this retreat. We call it. Yogi mind right. We're all yogis in the Buddhist sense of the word. Yogi doesn't meet someone that can bend into a pretzel. It means meditators are called Yogis were Bill Gates so sort of weird things start to happen where you get. It little idiosyncracies of your fellow meditators become sins, crying up to heaven for vengeance or you notice someone and you haven't talked to the you know you don't talk to them or anything, but you have this. Entire scenario of how you found your spiritual soul mate and you know like this whole thing unfolds and then when you finally break silence and talk to them for about 3 minutes. It's like what was I thinking? Not even wanna talk to this person anymore, so these kinds of sort of inflations of little things we learn to work with them. I highly recommend the poem by Robert Browning called soliloquy of a Spanish cloister. If you want to see Yogi mind to its Max. It's just a brilliant piece of work, how these monks or get. One month in specific is like. You know just lossed in these petty rage is OK. So you know, Easter W. It's the same. This kind of stuff happens, so the East and the West. Monks were having this. Dispute. Over who owns the cat. And so master not Tran heard the commotion came out. And grab the cast held it up. With a knife in another hand. OK, now don't get hotel. We'll take it, too, literally there's something being pointed too. That's really important, and he said. If any of you can say a word. It will save the cat. Otherwise, I'm going to cut it into. And they were all fixated in confusion and doubt. So he cut the cat into. Supposedly. Um. Now I'll give you a heads up. This is leading to a Co-op you're going to be asked a question. Um. Shall I give you a hint even before I asked the question. I will give you a hint. I will tell you at least in my interpretation. What the answer to the koan is? Oh, but maybe not as well. Yes, the answer to the koan is on my T shirt. So this is like jeopardy, OK, so what's the question answer is an old T shirt. If you remember what I said about what this means OK. So then what's the question. So when job to returned non tradable told him the story of what happened during the day. Um. At which point. Talk to took office samples. Put them on Top of his head. And walked out. To which Non travel said. Job troll. Could have saved by cat? So the colon is. Why? Why was chapter of the person that could have saved the cat? What do you think? Are you fixated in confusion? There's nothing wrong with being confused? In fact being confused is really good? Um being coagulate Ng when you're confused. Not good. The goal is not to be is not to avoid confusion. Doubt disorientation the goal is not to avoid don't know. The goal is to avoid the habitual coagulations. Around don't know. Une coagulate it don't know. Is called? Spontaneity when it. Comes out of your body? And wisdom. When it turns in your mind. I repeat. Unko angulated don't know. Is dynamic spontaneity when it comes out of your body and wisdom? When it turns in your mind? So. Remember, the story. Um. Not sure and ask the monks to. Turn a word to say something to manifest and they were coagulate eed in don't know. So they couldn't say anything. So they lost the cat. Um. Don't go ahead and immediate response. No fixation let so ever. But what did it mean. Does it mean to put your sandals on your head? The part that's Underneath. Is now on Top? But where are you? And. The person that lives there. There are. It would be the kind of person who could save the cat. Zen master woman. Commenting on Jojo's activity. Um. Said something to the effect ovw. He grabbed the knife away from NACHA. An now natural is begging for his life. Praised him that highly. So. You don't understand right or maybe some of you do. So not understanding is fine that's good. As long as you're working through the habitual tendencies. To coagulate as soon as don't know horizons. It was a brilliant way to symbolize. Without having to use words. Um. What it means to live? Below. Via risings of the world. To live below open? What is born to live in 0? Be ultimate humility. Such a person could save the cat. On. So. Total. Is famous for his old coma? Maybe one of the most famous koans in the whole history of them? An one that's a secure, Oh, she talks about a lot. Thank God otherwise I wouldn't know how to discuss it for you, I've got, I've got the Cliff notes. From an actual master. Um it relates to exactly the same thing. It's about exactly the same thing. But from a little different perspective. So. A gentle lift in the Tang Dynasty. And the time dynasty was roughly very roughly 600 to 980. It's the Golden Age of Chinese culture. Interesting sort of corresponds to really the darkest period of European history. But that was the Golden Age of Chinese culture. Buddhism came into China before that considerably Buddhism came into China in the Han dynasty. Han dynasty is about 200 BC to 280, so roughly straddles the beginning of the Christian hero or you could think of the Han Dynasty's corresponding roughly to the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire. So this sort of Roman period that 400 years. Approximately 200 on either side of the time of Jesus. Was? That was Han in China and Rome was ruling in the Western World and it was then that Buddhism came into China as a cookie foreign cult from it yet. Um so Tang dynasty is much later, six 700 years later. It took that many centuries for this cookie foreign cult from India to be fully metabolise UHD. Into a form that was comfortable for the Chinese meaning an expression of enlightenment that was that fit the Chinese culture. And. That's Chung or is that so these Masters from the Tang Dynasty Matsu Non Tran. Jump to Um. That was from that period. It took all those hundreds of years. Sort of interesting because. I think it's only going to take not even 100 years. For something similar to happen in the West, but then things move much faster now. So. Um. Northern Chinese to this day. Call themselves Han run. Which Hun you even see it on the Internet right? Han Chinese that means as opposed to other ethnic groups that are in China. But People from South China, Tonya right they like from Hong Kong can't, they call themselves. A tongue People OK. Um. I guess because why it maybe it was that that I don't know, but in South China, then they usually. In my correct usually use tongue instead of hot later right. Yeah, it's just good, yeah, so for whatever reason, so. The way Chinese was pronounced in the Tang dynasty is preserved in South China, whereas the Mandarin, which is spoken in North. China has gone through a lot of modifications because N China is where all the. Well, it's just a lot of reasons that the language changed up there. So this is a famous story. I'm going to say it in Mandarin. It's a story about John Jewel. But then I asked Phillip to say it in Cantonese, so you can be able to hear it. The weight job. Joe would have said it and heard it OK. There's a very different feeling tone to the language. So here's the and then I'm off I will translate also into English, but job to shop. In some Watt. Codes. One you're forcing. Yeah, whoo. Draw. You. OK, so that's that's the story in in modern Mandarin pronunciation, so mass chowchow hushon so mastered auto in someone. Happened to be asked by a monk a monk S mastered auto. Goals. When you're 4 shape, yeah, woo. Codes means a dog a puppy. Uh. Apparently, as they were talking this little puppy was walking around or something so the monk pointed, in the puppy and said. Golds white you're forcing Gamble does the dog have for ship the put down nature? Are Yahoo or not so yo means have? Woo means not have now, yeah makes it an exclusive order OK, yes or no. Does the dog have to put the nature? So that's the part you have to appreciate. Oh, about this coin is that UM. The monk is setting a trap. For Master John troll. OK. Yes, or no exclusive or OK. So literally in Chinese, it's dog have. But our nature or Not not have. But. Is a little different? Language feeling to it if you hear it in the way it probably would have sounded to Zhaozhou. So why don't you manifest that this is the Cantonese pronunciation? Choose a war so young young man, Cauchy one Yao Faxing Llamo. So one Moe. So. Dow. Mobile. Sounds a little bit more like the English. Yes, no that's why I like it in the Cantonese pronunciation. Yes, or no. Does the dog have Buddha nature Yao mold? OK. What do you think? What's the right answer? Hum. Should I give you a hint? The right answer depends depends on the context. There's several right answers is but there are also those right answers are also wrong answers in a different context. So let's start with the context of traditional Buddhism. From the viewpoint of early Tera Vaada Buddhism. Does the dog have opened the nature no? Only a human being. Can become a put down? Animals are too stupid and gods are too blissed out the condition that's in between animals of gods is the human condition, smart enough. To figure things out, but uncomfortable enough to be motivated to do something about it, so early Buddhist idea is human life is very special because only the human life has the right mixture of intelligence pleasure and pain. To clue what person in. To the need for enlightenment. So from that point of view, Scholastic Lee, the answer is no dog doesn't have to put the nature. Um, however, from the high so that's Hinayana that small vehicle POV. However, from the Mahayana POV. It is a philosophical item of belief. That everything has the Buddha nature. So the put that nature. The actual Characters in Chinese. Would be written? This way I don't know how much you can see at this is fall. It's pronounced fallen Mandarin. But it would have been pronounced something like boot. Along time ago, so that's from Blue Tower Buta. So this means put up but the interesting character is this one. This means this side of the character means to be born and this is heart or mind. So, your nature. Is? The consciousness. Um or mind or heart that you're originally born with. So this word it's pronounced show in Japanese. Oh, she in Mandarin Chinese. This is a very important word in East Asian Buddhism. Enlightenment initial enlightenment, what roughly corresponds to stream entry in SE Asian Buddhism is often referred to in Japanese as Ken shall can means to see and show means nature. When you see your nature. But what's interesting is? That. There's another character again, which is very related to camp, they are actually the same word in archaic Chinese. Anne get means to manifest. So Ken is is the I see it OK again is the. It manifests but they're actually the same word. Um so. Zen teacher that I studied with several of them, actually said that Ken show or to see your nature is really gential it's to manifest your nature. So what is your nature? Well, your nature? Is there's only one nature, it's the boot that nature. So how would a teacher interpret the put the nature well, you know how one teacher interprets it. The activity of expansion contraction. And that's the interpretation. We're going to use here that's The One I'm familiar with. So. From the viewpoint of Maya. Does the dog have liquid in nature the answer is yes? Scholastic Lee speaking the answer is yes. So. These are the answers that are correct. Up. From a Intellectual point of view. But you can be sure that. The monk who is trying to set a trap for jotul. Was not asking? What's the Terra cotta part party line? Dog and good and nature or what's the my on a party line on dog or put in nature. The monk was no doubt. Testing. The Master's ability. Not to explain as I just did. The answer, but to manifest. The answer. So. If you were mastered out to. And someone set a trap for you. That you recognize. By asking you an exclusive or question. OK. Yahoo. Mold. Yes. Or not. Ah. Dog have put an age. What are you going to say? What good? That would definitely be. On an acceptable answer. Uh. But maybe Little bit more. Go ahead and manifest. That would be an acceptable answer. No. Let's go back to intellectual. The problem with the question was the exclusive or. So. Uh. The answer. Would be to not get caught in the in the dichotomy of the exclusive or? So the answer that we just gave going back now, too intellectual for a minute. Was that? What was that answer in terms of yes? Yes. No. It's not yes. It's not null. Is it both or is it neither? Can that happen with just yes or just now? It takes yes animal right. To mold anything. To manifest any appearance. Takes an interplay of Yes and Oh. So that was the. Answer both. OK. You're expanding and contracting. Doing the doing called dog. That's mixing yes or no. To manifest the activity called dog. So that's a good answer. But that's not the one that Joshua. Now. Mobile. OK. Joshu said. More. No. No. So. Joe shoes Mo. Is it really? NO. Or is it? The close if you live in a culture that does not have 0 as a number. Um. Then the closest thing that you can have to that which is neither positive nor negative. The only only thing that you could do that. Beyond pot beyond yes or no if you had if you have to choose either. Yes, or no to express' that which is neither. Yes, nor no neither movement from nor tordsson, either pass plus nor minus neither expansion or contraction. Well, if you had to do one or the other, it's. 0 is more like no than it is like yes. Um especially if you say it? In a certain way OK. So the answer to this Co op is. In how you say the word no? If you say the word no? In a way that. Cancels yes animal. Which you can actually hear in the arcade Chinese? In Japanese, it's OK. And a Cantonese mole. So then. It's 0. The answer is 0. OK. Um. The answer is. That, which perceives. The manifestation of the dog. And that which follows the manifestation of the dog. Except for the point. The still point. There would be no doubts. And there is only the TS Eliot. So. The both. The polarization of Yes and Moe. To make a dog or a flower or? A life or a planet. Um. That is preceded by. And followed by. What is beyond yes and though? So there in separate. You could it would have been a correct answer to separate yes, and all. An manifest dog in between. But it's equally a correct answer to bring yes and no together. Because that's what's before. The both. And that's what's after the both. So it's a cycle. Neither the Big No. 0. The RG home push over the. The Alpha privative. Of the unborn. The place where job Joe. Active from Symbolized by having being below. His sandals. Below the earth below what is born? That place. Is half of what you need to know to be enlightened? And. The other half is. When it's yes ammo. Dancing together. No yes, no no which is sort of the know with Big Capital No. Bowling. The way. I personally like to point People. To this just my own style because I like system. Is well the place where things come from zero the source? Is the place that they go to? So you can train yourself gradually systematically to start to notice. When things disappear. And a sensitivity develops overtime. Until you finally see what happens why things disappear. The reason things disappear is that the forces, a polar forces that mold them cancel. And then they re polarize and then they cancelled it's a cycle. There's another way. Well, there's many other ways to come to this same knowledge. One of the most powerful ways, is called Self Inquiry. It's the flip side of just not gone. Just the reversal. In that practice you're constantly trying to look over your shoulder. And see where the moment arose from. The unborn whence things are born. So that turning 180 degrees, turning consciousness back on itself asking who am I. What is this not as an intellectual question, but as an observing? Um. So, in that case, a has arisen. And you ask where did they come from? In this other practice, which. I like because I can make it systematic and I can gradually training People to do it. There's no gradual training for self inquired you just do it. There's no algorithm you just do it. There's no instruction is always the same order, the teacher. That's just like well. Where did that come from or where did that come from? So that could be very powerful. But since I like algorithms and system and Lo K. Let's see what's coming up with People and whatever I like something that I could teach step by step, so I sort of approach it from the other side OK. Let's let's see where things go too. But it's the same process the same process. So. Um. So, in the just not God approach. A has arisen and now let's stay with a until we notice the instant. The advantages. The instant that a vanish is is also the instant that be arises. The very instant? What is BB is whatever came after a? So if you want to be truly. At the absolute now whence something rises. Just want something pass. And then you'll be either nothing will happen. Which case? Your job to. Or. Something will happen and you'll notice it coming from. Yes. And now My 2 favorite words. Riddle. When I ask someone a question. If they just say yes or just say no without any modifications. An that's nice but usually there's modifications. So. Um. As a parting gift. I'm going to slip you the secret how's that sound? Now slip in the secret. With regards to yes and no. The goal. Is to have a clear and deep? Experience of No.","title":"Shinzen Young tells Stories of Yes & No"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/shinzens-75th-surprise-birthday-party/","text":"","title":"SHINZEN\u2019s 75th SURPRISE BIRTHDAY PARTY"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/silent-33-minute-meditation-led-by-shinzen-young/","text":"","title":"SILENT 33 MINUTE MEDITATION ~ led by SHINZEN YOUNG"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/silent-5-minute-sit-with-shinzen-young-stephanie-nash/","text":"","title":"SILENT 5 MINUTE SIT ~ with Shinzen Young & Stephanie Nash"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/spacing-out-resistance-are-golden-opportunities-shinzen-young/","text":"Yes, so using that which is how I mostly meditate. Usually between one of the techniques. I space out often that'll happen. And I'm not in a good place to figure out what to do next with. It during that space out period, but I realized I spaced out So what I've been doing is picking something having something already set in mind that if I put great that's a clever strategy but also you know, my standard thing as soon as soon as you get the hint that you're spacing out if possible. Watt, what do you do? I'll give you the I'll give you the the the I hit SL spoken labels it's not so matter. A bunch of matter of I'm spaced out all I gotta find a new technique. It's I'm spaced out. I gotta use my options, with this technique continue on this, but they know that and I often comes to mind. And I don't want you. I wish I felt stronger to work with that, or so usually I'll just go back to that beginning text. So let me put a positive spin on I don't want. That's my job basically is to show that actually everything is going to go out. All the I don't want to. Why is why is what's positive about the I just don't want to? System thing OK. Well, you're spacing out right. It means that the concentration isn't good. It means that the attention is being scattered now. And we want to gradually train ourselves, so that our attention isn't scattered. But what's difficult is? That what scattering attention is not tangible there's an intangible force that is scattering your attention. And you're at the mercy of it as long as it's intangible. Now here's the here's why the I just don't want to use spoken labels. Is a window of opportunity because if you do speak the labels? You're gonna not feel good. In subjective space, the Speaking of the labels is going to be uncomfortable. That's why you don't want to do it. And forcing yourself to do it will make you uncomfortable. Why is that good because the invisible forces that were controlling you? Now have come up. As tangible sensations in the body that are penetratable. OK and so you go to focus in or a focus on feel feel in. And you force yourself to do the spoken labels that you apply it to. How uncomfortable you are speaking the labels and that then allows you to work through those those forces in the tangible way so that I wasn't being facetious or cavalier when when I said that actually it is actually window of opportunity to work through the driving forces of scattered nahs so if you're willing to do it, you're going to really develop concentration power effectively. If you're not willing to do it. It's Penny Wise and pound foolish. You you feel a little better during the set, which are not really deeply training, the skills. So that's my little motivational should be over. SL spoken labels yes. This morning I spent. 1st and 2nd Sith I was really tired from. And so I use labels that were mouse, yeah, Soto Voci anyway. To do is spoken labels and it's completely affected. It was really good. You whispered the words you use a book. You just move your lips and you don't have any place where you describe the 3 different ways of labeling and record differently. That's in the next edition. That's that is the biggest Lakunle in there, which I realized my horror what's wrong with this picture, the central technique is not fully described? Now. There is The Hobbit noted label on the Internet OK, but we forgot to put it into the manual OK. So yeah, it's like the thousand pound elephant in the room, so poignantly aware of that. Thank you resistance. Do you stop on a dime? I I'm not sure I understood what you're doing you're stopping on a dime and that that character? What happens is yes, I I went through it, fast, so thanks for asking. So we sometimes are aware of just that there are like in forces driving us in our behaviors driving us to think driving us to talk. Dragon us to move an it's like force just a force that's making me do it. And it's intangible in the sense that I can't. Locate it in time and space are you many quality to it other than say it's a force. How long I'm saying? This is nothing mysterious so far right OK so. How can we make these invisible intractable forces? Tangible and tractable so that we can actually penetrate them and work them through while they have to come up to percolate up to tangibility the way they percolate up to Tange abilities through abstinence. OK, if you abstain from X then what's been driving you to do X is going to come to the surface. It's going to come to the surface as image talk, emotional body sometimes physical body too. This is true for any addiction recovery situation whether it's recovery from a substance or recovery from compulsive thinking. Or recovery from. Life the ultimate in covering program break the addiction to life and death. Call separation. But same is true OK, though the same principle holes you have to abstain. In order for what's been driving it to come up and be tangible as image talk body OK. So when that happens now you can apply a technique so the situation that Pam was describing is well, I space out. And that's ahead and space out and I know that I should go to the spoken labels. But I don't want to do it, so that's another happen, not wanting to do the spoken labels So what I said, is well let me put a positive spin on that situation. If you do it if you force yourself if you abstain from not life. Speaking the labels OK, so in this case. It's a do the behavior thing if you do that behavior. You're going to feel uncomfortable what we don't want to feel uncomfortable in general, but actually in this case, we do because whatever comes up in Stockton. Emotional body of I hate this, or band here bank here back here that represents the forces that were driving those behaviors. But now those forces are not invisible forces their tangible sensations. Their tangible visual auditory of somatic experience is what? What is tangible can be quantized and can be experienced completely can be penetrated therefore? What is tangent? What is all well? What is trackable OK? When is tangible is travel meaning that we can apply? A mindfulness technique to things are intangible that they're not trackable OK, so there's little we can do other than white knuckle. But. What is what is tangible is track of? Maybe you can noted. What is trackable is is tractable? Means you could get a handle on. So that's the mechanism that I was describing with regards to why. You what's gonna happen if you force yourself to speak the labels and why that's a good thing kinda. Not the same is stopping at a time it's very related 'cause when you stop on a dime in daily life. Then. The juices that have been stirred up by life come up with a vengeance very quick. If you can be Johnny on the spot with it, you can actually meditate retroactively. Hum. Like you say, well, I thought that's against the rules, you can do. Let's say that you're bopping around in the world and you just like a whirling Dervish near it going here going there. No techniques know aware. And I'm going to. Really face what's been stirred up. In that 10 minutes if you really bring your A game. You can retroactively process all those hours of unconscious phonetic nahs. And that's the rhythm of the Cente. Unlike a vipasana train. They zende is run around like crazy stop on the run around like crazy stop and I leased Rinzai. Zen Soto Zen. Not so much. But Rinzai Zen, absolutely run around like crazy stop on the dog run around like crazy stuff on the dock all day now that's either going to make you just phonetic as hell or are you going to learn what I just said, which is like when you're running around like crazy. And then you stop on a dime you can process all that crazy, very, very quickly. And. So it goes so yes, it's related it sounds like a version of this well asceticism is. A generic term so. It. There are many facets to asceticism that could be one of them yes. Well, what I was running my restaurants. I would every hour go out and sit on the bench in front of the restaurant. The bus stop bench for 5 minutes and I found the great advantage of that stopping like that is that then at the end of the day. You haven't built up a whole lot of sense or as you. Periodically let government so that your much calmer at the end of the day that was my pepper right? That's a great specific example.","title":"Spacing Out & Resistance are Golden Opportunities  ~ SHINZEN YOUNG"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/taking-temperature-of-subconscious-processing-shinzen-young/","text":"One of my favorite. Uh. Joke now we're not jokes, but just funny things that I'll ask someone is. Do you think that like you look at a neon light bulb neon or that kind of thing? You could touch it right, it's cold. But I'll say. Do you believe me that the that? The temperature inside that neon bulb. Is compara bulto the temperature in the core of the sun? Most People would say no way right, but actually it is The thing is there just aren't very many molecules in there. So it doesn't transfer much heat to you. But there there plasma there like the like there on the sun. They're moving that fast, but it's has very little density. So you touch it. They don't transfer hardly any heat to you at all, so you have no perception of of. How really much enerji there is an average but like I say hi average kinetic energy but if you don't have a lot of particles than the total enerji. They're going to transfer to the surface of that bulb is not very much OK, so anyway end of physic lesson? What is the metaphor. Well, you'll recall that Freud. Thought of the psyche in terms of pressures because that was sort of the. The physics of the day. What I find interesting is that? If you Parse your mental experience. Into. A visual component, which it would be mental images and an auditory component, which would be mental talk. When you start to do that you. You're aware of images a lot of times they vanish right away or aware of talk. Sometimes it just vanish is but at some point that sort of surface activity tends to go away. But the space image space is still there talk space is still there and when you tune into image space or talk space. Sometimes you're aware of a kind of subtle undercurrent of motion like there's a kind of stirring in talk space. You may or may not be able to make out words. You may or may not be able to make out what the conversation is about. But there's a sort of undercurrent of activation and there's something analogous to that in image space. And there can also be something analogous to that in your emotional centers. You're not actually experiencing any emotion per se, but it's like there's something sort of idling down there. So. What is that lot of times People will say sort of look up on that as a problem it's like I can't get rid of. That sort of undercurrent of something going on down there well, what that is, is. Subconscious visual thought. Subconscious auditory thought. And subliminal emotional sensation. Um. And if you explore inner inner space image space. Talkspace emotional body space when the surface stuff is sort of dissipated. And you're watching that. That general level of? Stirring down there. Sometimes it's uniform. It just sort of is at a constant pace OK. Other times it sort of speeds up and then subside sort of bursts and then subsides subside. So. Although you are not aware of the specific content necessarily. Of the subconscious. You are monitoring by monitoring the general level of activation. Do you see the metaphor? You're taking the temperature of the subconscious. You're monitoring sort of metaphorically the average kinetic energy. That's going on. And if the temperature is more or less constant. It's all sort of at the same frequency. Then, what's optimal is too evenly cover subjective space and just let your awareness sort of soak into that whole field. And. What that's going to tend to do? Is? Break up the Is going to lessen the viscosity? So this density viscosity temperature entropy these are called state variables. And these are sort of the This is great. The Great achievement of 19th century physics, one of the great achievements is statistical thermodynamics, so there are these state variables, so if it's more or less like an even level of Vibra Tori activity. Then sort of cover the whole space, you soak awareness into it. You don't try to figure out what's going on, you give it permission to just sort of move around down there. And you'll find that that will cause that system to become. More and more fluid, meaning less and less viscous. On. On the other hand, if you notice pattern that it's sort of activates and deactivates so it's sort of like heats up and then suddenly cools off metaphorically. What's optimal in that case is too. Watch this sort of burst of energy and then detect the gone and briefly look. Down the Valley where those little bubbles went too. 'cause they're pointing right to Nirvana right to cessation. So you get launched you gone if it gives you that pattern that get interested in the rhythm of arising passing arising passing but this is subtle vibrations. Sort of shimmering and then dying away when that foam sort of dies away the silence. That, it points to is the absolute rest. The still point of the turning world, so there's a metaphor from good old 19th century physics. I mentioned that. So, in my mind, I think of this is well how cool is this, if Freud. It only known you can actually take the temperature in real time of the subconscious mind. And in doing so, the viscosity of the Subconscious gets worked through. And when when the Subconscious Self, the psyche. This inner see, hear feel self when it flows it. Gets creative. And liberated. So. That's One of my favorite metaphors, taking the temperature of the unconscious in real time. As a function of space. Temperature of this room is what a scientist would call a scalar field. Uh it means or a time varying scalar field. Means at each point in the space of this room, there's a physical quantity that can be measured by one real number. Which is temperature? And it's a temperature field a scalar field that varies with time, so the subconscious is actually analogous to a temperature Field 'cause. It has location. There's the visual part, the auditory part, the emotional body part and so forth.","title":"Taking Temperature of Subconscious Processing ~ SHINZEN YOUNG"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/the-agony-of-jargon/","text":"We have to deal with the agony of jargon here. Because different teachers use different language Ng. For identical phenomenon. And different teachers use identical words for entirely different from home. And there's just no way around that it just is because everybody sort of develops their own. So it is hugely confusing to. And I'd really feel sorry for anyone that hasn't done 30 or 40 years of practice. Because it takes 30 or 40 years to see when 2 People are using the same words. For something completely different than when they're using very different words for something completely. The same just takes a long time typically to develop that kind of sent you know that clarity now. I don't think this situation is going to go on for many more. Decades certainly not for more than a century or 2 because we're now dialoguing. The teachers dialogue. They didn't in the old days. Everybody had their only futile domain. Lords of the Castle and they didn't do open peer to peer. Dialoguing in public or say if anything happened in public. It was just a debate where they were trying to trance. The other guy and even the Buddha use. They look at the Buddhist Literature. It's just the Buddha, defeating one person after another after another with his paradigm that's what it is that's what the Pali Canon is about. It's not him, talking to other People peer to peer. OK, so. But now things are different. Now, now there's a different spirit, the spirit of science, the spirit of. Collegial cooperation. And that will probably gain momentum in the next 100 years or so. And. Probably we won't have this agony of jargon and seemingly conflicting Maps and claim. But right now here at the awkward intermediate period of history. So. Let me just try to make it as simple as possible. If Daniel or Kenneth says AP read that as both gone. Oh **** then end of story. OK, we just. For whatever reasons have this different language in things so that may help clarify alone. Um. So that deep experience of space spreading and collapsing as soon as it's arising OK that's your AP. Experiences. And one way to that means arising passing in the jargon of some teachers. It corresponds to dia dia VIA in Poly and it is mentioned definitely mentioned in the pali camp. And probably in a sense pretty similar to what those contemporary teachers. One way to measure you know, there's lots of ways to measure progress see. Now in. In early Buddhism, they measured progress in terms of. Working through craving aversion and unconsciousness. That's the different you know. Stream Enterer once returner non returner are hot and so forth that's that's one metric there's a. Alternate metric called the 10 oxherding pictures that gives you a picture of about 50 years of practice. From the first picture to though. Hey. 7th picture 700, yeah right. It's hard to see that those 2 Maps correspond exactly the same thing. Don't seem to have anything in common. Another way to measure progress is. Ah. For how long through what kind of intensity. Can you have an experience of both comp or? Rising passing. That's another way to measure progress. So.

Um. What's your take on this Kitty ditty? Row row row your boat gently down the stream Merrily Merrily, Merrily, Merrily Life is but a dream. I learned it in my earlier school years now. I can't get it out of my mind do. You suppose that my elementary teachers might have been latent Buddhists So what that is? Is that's the wisdom function within you? Seeing in popular literature, the deeper Dharma mean? That's really good. Um. The. They once did. I suppose it's actually been done a lot of doctors, but I know of one study. That was done by a colleague of mine at Harvard Medical School, many years ago. All. Where they gave roshak tests? Too much of. Mindfulness meditator's you know about this. Study down Brown not the damn Brown that wrote the Davinci Code Buddhist and that's a different person. So. What they did is? So OK, let's do psychometric some on monks. You know SE and I guess it was SE Asian. I don't want under the cohort specifically but they were graded by years of experience and there were a couple of them that were. Reputedly enlightened OK that you know, we're real senior addicts and what they found was that the senior add apps did something with them or shot. That had never been recorded in the entire history of roar shock. And lots of People have taken these let's see inkblot test right. You know what it is, you probably taken it certainly seen it on TP. So what they found among the the reputed our hearts. Was that that had never been recorded previously? Is? Not only did every inkblot appeared to contain some Dharma Principle. But. The the sequence of inkblots no matter how they presented the sequence became a coherent sequence of Dharma talks so they concluded that something really major, the way that these People see the world. It's like everything is in the Dharma Marvel comic book is the dark. So ro ro ro your boat it's absolutely the secret of enlightenment right in there, it's obvious. You're right. They were Crypto Buddhist every single one of them. Or maybe we're just seeing it in a certain way. And take your choice So what is this song about what does my Dharma I see in this son Rory boat gently down the stream merrily merrily merrily life is but a dream. So what's the stream well that's an interesting. Ha. The Buddha said that. What we're doing is? Is uh? Our party so to Garmany Mongo. Then, what we are on the path that is against the stream. That's where the name of the group comes from against the street. OK, but but he saw the party is against so does the street. So what does it mean means? What we do is against the stream of human culture? Human culture tends to. Uh. Encourage People to put all of their. Time in enerji into surface or conditional happiness. And. Never talks about the skill set associated with total happiness, which would include of course, the deeper on unconditional happiness. So even 2500 years ago, even in the Society of India, 2500 years ago, as far as the Buddha was concerned the society. Was pushing people in the other direction? Up. So, in that sense, we're going against the stream of human culture because the human culture. You know if you learn how to control if you learn the skill of controlling some strings on it, a musical instrument called a tower or you learn the skill of controlling a? A an elastic inflated sphere. Call the basketball. Millions and millions of dollars and adulation and celebrity an you know celebrity sex it all becomes available to you as the result of cultivating those skills so I'll take in a second so how but you know? Is there are there. There's sports awards there's Academy Awards but you know. Did you see anybody get the the award for the greatest manifestation of equanimity? Or the longest strong determination, said that's a sub category, the longest strong determination sit by and not Asian. Those rewards against the stream yes. No well, I'm actually making a contrast OK. I'm saying that well, we can make different metaphors. I'm going to make 1 just for the fun of it, so the book does said. We go against the stream, but this song says go with the stream right Merilee Merilee, Merilee Row your boat gently down the stream. So what if we want to make this a Dharma San then we have to find another stream. But the stream of human culture, according to the Buddha. We have to go against that stream, but is there a stream that we go with that we go down. When were on this path and I would say that is the stream of nature. That Enlightenment is just waiting to happen. It's implied actually in the Buddha's formulation. The Buddha said. The Eightfold path. Is an intervention that removes? A necessary condition for non perfection. Implying that the perfection is just waiting to happen. All you gotta do is knock out what's getting in the way so when I said that it is possible that the spontaneity aspect that the Masters speak about maybe that their tasting entropy entropy is the force behind all spontaneous. Maybe not all but. I'm not. A physical chemist but It's it's the force behind spontaneous reactions when things just happen. They happen, because of because of Kemp Trippy. For example, you ever wonder? Why it is if you stretch a rubber band. All you have to do is let go. And it shrinks. Well, it's because. The. Rubber is made of a lot of different strands is a polymer. And when you stretch it what you do is you. You impart in order to those strands. Which goes and as soon as you let go? It goes back to the disordered state that actually creates a force the spontaneity that just happen in this There's when you let go of the rubber band. There is a just happening nahs. It's Shrinking. That's the taste of entropy. It just happens, it goes right down the stream. It falls into existence, so I think that the stream in this Dharma San. Is? The natural is the force of nature itself. That is constantly calling us to enlightenment now you can take a Christian perspective because they say the gods always calling vocal copper location OK. Whether you can hear the call or not so I think let's take that to be the stream and of course. Merilee merilee means that you that's the happy that I claimed is the one word that describes everything. Life is but a dream. App means Featherlight and paper thin. Which is insight into? Impermanence and emptiness, but you know the interesting thing is it encourages you to row your boat In addition to just go down the street. So when you roll the boat, you are exercising control for the OR. Um. So do you know what the? Um. What the volume? Why should you have stupid question? What's the Greek word for someone who rose or control who steers the boat. But Greek word well, he will recognize it 'cause it's in English, but the person that controls the boat. Is called the Cooper net ace that's what's given us the word cybernetics also is given us the word governor? Like in the Watt governor that is a controllers are called governor's like like thermostat OK. It's a controller. It's a government engineering wise, so the encouragement to roll your boat. I would take to mean yes and also In addition to flowing down the stream of of enlightenment. Exercise control with regards to how you carry yourself in the world. So the entire Dharma absolutely correct and like I say I am sure that this was intentional part of the school teachers in the 1950s, mostly were Buddhists.","title":"The Great Dharma of 'Row Row Row Your Boat' ~Shinzen Young"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/the-quickest-way-to-enlightenment/","text":"Sometimes People ask me is there a really quick way to enlightenment. There's gotta be a quicker way lot of you know what's coming. This is a standard story that I tell. Which is well? Are you sure you want to know? Maybe you won't like what you hear. Yeah. I can tell you some pretty quick ways. To transform deeply? Strong determination sitting. It's a classic. I won't say that every master has done it. But I would say that the great majority of People that. Come to the master level on this path. Have done a lot of strong determination city. So what does that mean that means that you sit down? An you say OK for the next hour or the next 90 minutes or 2 hours or 3 or 4 whatever 3 days? Not going to voluntarily move. So. Right now, the prospect of something like that seems. * Riffic. It might not imagine yourself doing that, well first of all. I said it could just be an hour or 90 minutes, OK doesn't have to be 3 days. Uh. Secondly. Even if it was 4 hours or 8 hours. This is not so. Extravagantly. Um. All unrelated to experience is that normal human beings have. In fact, I would suggest to you, that at least half of all human beings that ever lived. Oh. I've been through an experience comperable and intensity. Do you get what I'm talking about? OK. Uh. Sitting sitting for 8 hours and breaking through a posture is not more intensive giving birth to a baby. If you done that OK now of course, it's a different circumstance so I mean, first of all there's no way out. Secondly, there's a lot to distract and, yes, nowadays their medications and so forth, but the way. Most People had to give birth to babies for most of humanity human, Humanities history. It was, I think it was nature's way too. Bring that person to a permanent transcendence sort of makes sense right you're doing the activity of the source. Spanning and contracting. It's interesting I talked about the Sundance yesterday native People. So the story that sold among the Lakota Sioux is that? It originally son dancing was for men only. All. Not innocence women even children actually. The men wanted to know what it was like to give birth. So if you look at the symbolism of the Sundance the men wear skirts like women. And. They you're attached by a tether pierced. Which is symbolic of the umbilical cord? And then you have to break those and that's like. Being born, etc like new new birth actually in the old days after after their 4th year of Son Dancing. They considered that they had died and were a completely new person. And it actually gave away all their possessions like everything. Although teepees and Ponies and that everything they just like started from scratch as a new person. Um. OK so even though it's sort of sounds like really far out there is actually no more than what at least half of humans do. But at the good news is strong determination sitting you can gradually work up to you train yourself slowly to be able to do this kind of thing. So the Aw. There's one absolute rule. Do not do not do not physically damage the body. So how are you going to know if you're physically damage in the body well remember you gradually train yourself to do this right. It's a slow training so sit for an hour. He got some pain you get up. It goes away. You're OK, Yeah, but damage the body. Then you know you add 5 minutes, 5 minutes, 5 minutes and as long as you getting up and after a few minutes. You're OK, then you're OK, I can assure you that with rare exceptions. Most People can sit down for 4 hours and not move and get up and they haven't like damaged any joints or anything like that, but you gradually learn how to do this, or by the way your legs, falling asleep isn't going to damage anything, it's not you're not cutting off circulation so much. It's more pressure on nerves that causes that paresthesia thing and that as you notice. Disappears as soon as you get up. There might occasionally be exceptions, where People have neurological or circulatory issues so if you wonder about that check check it with the doctor, but usually it's not that big a deal. The main the main danger in your legs, falling asleep is not massive necrosis that you might be fantasizing that issues are dying made danger is if you try to. Get up too quickly your legs will not hold you and you fall. I've seen some really far out. You know, People that didn't know that, like in Zenon clackers going on OK. Everybody jumps up and they just like through a somersault and crosses and so, yeah, I have to get up so. What's involved in a strong determination sitting well. You're going to have. 4 things arise. You're going to have physical sensations. And those are going to get more and more and more intense for sure. And then you're going to have your thoughts and emotions that you will and your desire and your judgments on rising moment by moment reactively to that. So that's a pretty big object that's the whole mind body self that's why. If you can have a complete experience of that. It's a powerful transcendence and that's why as I say not everyone that becomes a master but in Asian style training. Awful lot of People that become Masters. They do this. So. So what's going to happen well. You start to get physical discomfort now, what I usually do this is my own personal strategy. You'll find whatever strategy works for you, if you decide to do things like this. But my personal strategy is. 2. Start by detecting the global spread of the pain rather than going immediately to the local intensity. That's see that's Sort of the The sensory clarity skill. After you get really intimate with the body you realize that the body is like a pond an not always but quite often when there's a local physical or emotional splash. There's a global ripple. And. One of the options within the noting apparatus. Is what I call zooming you can zoom in that you can zoom out and consume both ways so zooming both ways means that you. Thrust your attention into the local splash. But so that's contracted but at the same time you spread your attention over the whole body. So you sort of zoom in and out at the same time now, what that does. Is? That Greece is the rails so to speak. For sensations to dissipate in the volume of the body itself analogous to boyles law in physical chemistry pressure is inversely proportional to volume. If pressure is analogous to suffering. So. Here's how that works so when you zoom into a local intensity. Of course, that becomes very salient. It intensifies even more. But at the same time you're zooming out. Now, one of two things will happen either. There will be conscious sensations that are spreading from that local intensity. And the zoo with the zooming out you'll be able to detect that and open up to it and facilitate that. The other possibility is that actually there aren't conscious spreading sensations. And that's fine. It's not always the case that there are conscious, spreading sensation. But it is almost always the case with rare exception. That there are subconscious, spreading sensations going on now an important principle in mindfulness is we only ask you to attend to what is available in conscious experience? Spot so don't worry if you don't detect any of that subliminal spread. But here's the subtlety of the of the technique that sort of cleverness of the option. If you spread your awareness over the whole body. Zoom out while you zoom in. Then even if there's not a conscious awareness of the spread of the sensation. The movement of your attention over the whole body greases. The rails for the subconscious processing. To spread without impeded so you don't may not consciously. Be aware but you're giving the very subtle, spreading tendencies of the body? What they need to dissipate the density of things so. That's one possible strategy for doing it, so anyway, I tend to sort of try to get the. The local splash of the global ripple. And then at some point. All I start to freak out. So where does the freak outcome well the freak out is in the subjective system? I start to go Oh my God, Oh my God, no no OK and I start to get like disconcerting images of being stabbed and burned and you know. What have you Palm and then the emotions start to come up in the body subtle hint that eeriness? All local here there's a? There is a kind of cold. Spear thing that sort of like pervades the body. Subtle but subtle is significant. Those see in here in Feelin reactions are natural. Uh if you contract them and I blocked them, they won't be a problem. If you can't. Then they're going to cross multiply with the physical sensations. And so instead of. CN plus here and plus feel in, plus fill out. You're going to get see in times here in times, Feelin times fill up. That's why if you ever noticed. It's like I can handle it, I can handle it, I can handle I know normally I can't handle. It's not linear right, it's not like. It grows like this, it grows like this that's because things are starting to cross multiply. But if you have enough clarity to separate out the strands so that they don't. Oh. They don't tangle and reinforce each other than actually it just grows linearly. And, yes, it gets more more more, but you don't get this sort of like. Uh. Snowballing overwhelmed thing. It just grows girls girls girls girls crumbs crumbs crumbs crumbs and then. Something happens. And then Cons Girls girls girls girls girls red and then it just flows flows flows flows. And then yeah, you go through another cycle and it's like it's a little more. And then this follows for us folks what's the whole mind body process. Um. It's scary because the ordinary ordering principle is completely unavailable. The ordinary ordering principle of the body is get comfortable the ordinary ordering principle for the mind is get answers. An you can't do by there that those are just not available. The mind can't process. It's fact here eyes are sort of rolling in your head. And you're right on the verge of passing out. Um. But. You got a smile on your face. Because you are moment by moment tasting purification. And so you're getting an immediate reward. Um. Once again this may sound radical, but half the people in this room have done this. I remember back if you had kids. Uh. So it's just a matter of doing it. And I'll really systematic way. Um. So. That's That's a really big object the whole mind body self. But. If we appreciate it to the extreme. Just as it is. Then, at some point, it becomes flowing space. Gradually gradually gradually work your way up to this snot. It's a homework assignment, you got the rest of your life to turn him. Um. And you don't have to do it if you don't want to you can just follow the path of Bliss that John's the absorptions?

I would say that's not incorrect, but it's exactly half the picture. I think for a lot of People when they hear Buddhists talk about emptiness. The image that comes to their mind is some sort of. Oh. Some sort of Bleakness. It's like. You bust your buns for 40 years on the cushion and what do you have to show for it emptiness? Maybe that's another rabbi in Rochie joke the road, she says.

It was a scathing critique of Aristotelian an paracelsian alchemy, essentially and is thought of as the beginning of modern chemistry. But the year before he wrote that he wrote something that was subtitled that I just loved the title of this. Touching the spring of the air. That's how the back in those days talked about pressure is like you know it's like the springiness of the air touching the spring of the air. And. That is.

What's in? How do you practice mindfulness techniques? Daily cycle yearly cycle daily cycle have a good time. What's the history of mindfulness show monic. Prius prehistoric show monic origins, historic meditative traditions? Present research also blamed new Donovan New Age. Uh. This is the basics what why where when now the details details on Watt. What is concentration? Well, I've given all the lectures. I'm not going to go into it. But you know, there's is what it is what it is it instances, the deep view and the taste and the same information for sensory clarity and the same information for equanimity details notice. It lines up wonder one details about this you store here. Details about this There's the noting board. There's the focus on positive board iconographically represented positive affect is smiling positive behaviors legs positive. Cognition is a brain ideal or archetype is holy figure positive situation is a dawn similar to this, but then this is other and you could do it in the visual auditory somatic. We don't show the do nothing bored 'cause it's nothing. And this box tells you the four kinds of information you can extract from these boxes their strategies for formal practice their ways of classifying cutting up the pie of sensory experience their ways of formulate of figuring out applications for certain jobs in the world? How can I deal with this? How can I do deal with that you can formulate your strategies at your tool kit and also it gives you a detail view of the history. That's a a sundial you remember that, we went through this whole thing and we outlined the whole history of world contemplation based on these categories, so these are the four types of information you can extract from the game boards. Uh. So details about this. Details about this. What up here details about Mister Happy Head? OK. What surface happiness? Avoiding pain getting pleasure, avoiding pain? What's deep happiness experiencing pleasure times, mindfulness and what instead of avoiding pain, you can experience pain divided by mindfulness, reducing suffering. What does the mine want it want stuff to shine it's light on all these different problems but what does it really want to shine it's light? And the socket that it's connected to what you think you want is to avoid. Don't know mine, but what you really want is to be able to experience don't remind us and empowerment what? What you think you want, which is valid is good situations, sunny weather. Not bad weather. But what you really want because it leads to these things is positive behavior. So if you get this for yourself, you're going to be very happy. You asked me what's the definition of enlightenment, so this is a figure with a :) but the outline is very diffuse. There's no separation between inside and outside Thingness to separate. And the consequences of that is that you want to serve you want to serve materially. You want to serve by this is a mouth teaching mindfulness mouth, not fit you give Donna you support those that serve materially and you support. Those we teach so this gives you more information about this now, let's go deep. This is deep this is basics. Detail detail detail this is just for decoration. But but it's sort of cool because this reminds us that our sensory experiences again young thing. And we see that in detail over here. This reminds us that our path. I techniques at a deep level arise through an interplay. Maybe not exactly in Jan. But there's a little expensive contract. If so this reminds us of the deep view over here. This is practice. This is the deep view of practice. The interplay of active versus passive work with the parts work with the whole make discriminations break discriminations. Manifest itself. Go into the Nosa. So this is. This is the sort of the yen. Yang, the inner game of practices here and the sort of yin. Yang of sensory experience. The basic molding forces. The tug of subjective versus object if activation. The surface manifestations of expansion and contraction. The deep manifestations of expansion and contraction and the effortless activity of time itself rising and passing simultaneously. These are the forces superficial and deep that mold sensory experience, so this. This is this is the doorway to the deep view on this. This is the doorway to the deep view on this and this is the doorway to the deep view on the universe. Displayed here. The. The title of the universe is. Omega. Which is that like that related to the Cosmo logical constant that big it's the number it's the interplay of expansion and contraction that molds the universe as a whole. Then the universe is at the finer scale. The smallest times smaller spatial scale is the plank and then this thing with the dot. This Sir component represents all the structures that arise in between the universe as a whole. And the Planck scale the cosmic space scale and they plunk spatial scale. There's all these structures. That sort of seem to reflect a contract if Corrine expensive cloud or something along those lines and what are they galaxies supermassive black hole in the center effusive cloud of stars sons? We talked about it or an in between the expansion of thermal photon pressure in the contraction of self gravity. Planets. Core mantle atmosphere interactions cause certain in and out of the core and mantle cause. This surface continents to flow rising and falling of thermal currents caused the weather to flow. The human being anatomically. Scott asleep but it's got nerves that input this process in the brain. Motor goes out. The heart. And the Kappel Aries, it's an expansion contraction thing, we have similar kind of structure and in our complicated of all creatures. We are the ones that are most aware of the input output in terms of cause and effect. So we live very much in that world. Also, the cell. I gave a whole talk about how this cell is formed by lipid bilayer. OK, with the with a polar ends sticking out into the watery environment on the outside and the watery environment on the inside. Creating an inside outside situation, then macro molecules like proteins with nonpolar core. And surrounded by polar atoms are polar radicals. And So what did those polar radicals do well. They can migrate into this membrane and start to create very complex interactions that are input output of energy and matter and information into the cell. That same sort of deal contractive core surrounded by this Halo and then atoms work very much in some ways like galaxies and at the base of it. Is the mathematics? The operations of mathematics. Which all have the same basic structure just different flavor? It's an intertwining of 3 kinds of polarizing and canceling activities. You have movement you have you have? Step forward step back, don't move you have stretch out pull in. Don't move you have world this way world that way don't move. All the movements of the dancer. Are represented by the mathematics and? Therefore the The fact that the mathematics seems to have this polarization cancellation type of situation. Shouldn't surprise us because we've discovered it in our own sensory experience seems to be something very fundamental about the way so it's sort of at the base of what models all of this there was a famous bio famous bio mathematician named how Dane HALDNE as an Englishman and this was back and I guess the Victorian Oregon. Guardian period. Maybe not quite that old, but back there early 19th century, he was active someone once asked him. Based on his study of mathematics and biology had, he been able to discern any characteristics of the creator. Could you say anything about God's personality based on development of this field of file mathematics and he said yes as far as I can see the main characteristic of God is that he has an inordinate fondness for beetles. But actually I would paraphrase how they? I think God has an inordinate. Fondness for By contrast, and cancellation. That seems to be the pattern. Let me see very broadly. And that is everything important that I know. I hate you.

To make sure the Donna stream is intended and but I used to be extremely cynical an rude about all of this stuff when I started 'cause I basically. You know, I just thought it was BS. You know early very early on when I was a kid and I was just studying this stuff. It was cool to read about and I liked it and I like the Asian languages. But I really thought that it was all made up by them by the monks in order to deceive the faithful. I mean, I really thought that. And when I went to Asia and I've heard great Masters speak. I'm not I was privileged. I actually like heard People like Yamada Moon Shibayama Zenki. Maybe these names, don't mean much to you. But these are the gods of mid 20th century. Japanese then and there were still alive when I was there both of them. And I and I could speak not just add Japanese I. I actually heard these People give talks. And. Ah. I when I didn't think they were making it up in order to like increase the temple revenue. But what I did think is that they were making it up to blow people's minds to like save really weird stuff, it's like it's sort of grabbed you and so I thought it was like a Zen affectation like an affected style of presenting things. Hum that is just basically it's like you know blow people's minds and get peoples attention whatever. Uh. Now I hear myself, saying this. I mean, I realize Oh my God, I mean, now I know for sure.

My first teacher. Was this sica? It was just like summer I actually is like he was really macho and the way you talked and he was. He was the. He was the president of the smoke club I mean.

Clohesy militaristic types, you know get into the martial arts and things like So what he would do is when at the end of each set ring the Bell to endless. It just before he would ring the Bell would be sitting there for an hour right. It was then the whole. Zen thing, although he was a shingle and Mumbai Linneage, but he trained in this end tradition an? Just before you hit the Bell he delivered like. Some sort of one line zingers sound bite. And then like hit the belt you know it was like really dramatic 'cause you're the really deep state you know it's like. It's brainwashing right you're being indoctrinated because it really hits. You right so I remember but it's good brain washing. I'm very grateful that I had that so I remember once. Uh. Looks like we're all sitting on it. 10:30 I doggies servers on my tools on my job. Go home but what it means is the some the Samadi that you go into and come out of. Is not somebody? Meaning so it took me years to really understand. I thought I understood what you meant but I didn't really understand what I thought he meant is OK stay in these states all the time, which is true. I mean that's part of what you meant but the deeper understanding is. That. When you When you're in a certain state and it's. Time to Start taking care of business, whatever businesses go to the washroom or. Drive to work or you know make breakfast. You're in this something and now it's time to the tendency is to want to. In some way go back to the normal way of being. And then OK I'm going to function. It's like OK well that was great, but now let's get back to the real world. And the trick is to just not do that. You. Whatever function needs to arise. Simply happens from that state. At U channel whatever doing needs to be done. And if that causes fear or disorientation. UE quantum eyes, it and you throw caution to the wind and you just function and that's one of the ways that that Zen bounces trained. So I would say when that happens. Um. If you Have to transition to some action. Fine just You know you don't leave. You may come out of somebody but you don't need to leave somebody in order to function. And if you come out. Why do you come out you come out because? The inner system reactivates. And if you see where that re activation comes from. You actually see. The self being born from the notes nansel. Then. You're just fine there's no. No no difficulties whatsoever and integrating I don't know if that was. What you were asking about but? OK, I think we're good for now.","title":"There's No Need to Leave Samadhi"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/touching-the-heart/","text":"So. Why did we come here? Why do we do this practice? Well, one way to think about it among many possibilities is that we came here in order to. Touch the heart. Both. Metaphorically and literally. So we know what it means to have one's heart touched. Metaphorically, it means to access a place of unconditional love. To love deeply that's how I would think about the heart that we're trying to touch when we do this practice. When we come to a retreat so that's sort of on the emotional side. However. This is not the superficial, meaning of touching the heart. Not that there's anything wrong with the superficial meeting but. The kind of touching of the heart that I'm thinking of that would be the purpose for this practice. Uh. Is too? Love deeply that would be my phrase. And I would say that the ability to love deeply is. Related to the second touching of the heart, which I said, is literally touching of the heart. So. You might think Oh literally then you mean touch the physical heart. No, I mean, touch the heart of the matter. The heart of the matter and the heart of the matter from the viewpoint of human experience is well what is human experience? What is the essence of our experience at the deepest level? Whenever I go to Canada. One of the things that I look forward to there is the fact that you can get really good. Indian food specifically S Indian food. If you're familiar with what's called the rupee cuisine. S Indian vegetarian can't get it very good in the US, but in Mississauga near the airport. In the Toronto area, you could get this really, really great. Indian cuisine and the other great cuisine that I can get in Toronto that I don't get in Burlington, or Tucson for that matter is Hong Kong style dim sum whenever I go to the dim sum restaurant. It always has a Kind of Association for me. Because of the 2 Chinese characters. That, in Cantonese are pronounced in some. In Mandarin is detention so. We like to. Represent the heart. This way. You see it everywhere. And the Chinese character for heart. Is actually fairly similar looking not a coincidence obviously? You can even get the aorta little bit, maybe and so forth so originally it was definitely a picture of a heart that looked a lot like like? Like this. So what's interesting is the. Phrase detention or dim sum. If you're interested you can look on Wikipedia and you'll see the same history. I'm about to tell you. So. DM. Could mean too warm? Um. Sort of warm your heart. So that's a snack but also it can mean to touch or to contact something if you spot. It you touch it. You have a contact and so for me, I always think of those, 2 sides to the practice the touching of the heart. At the deepest level up. This Chinese character some or shin. It means the physical heart, but it also means consciousness consciousness itself. In some languages consciousness is a word separate from the word that means heart. For example, Consciousness in Greek is noose, but the word for heart is. You know what cardiology right. What is it Cardium I guess in Greek it's different words but it turns out that in Chinese the word that means and also Japanese same kanji the word that means the physical heart also means consciousness. Sometimes you see it translated as mine MIMD, but that can be very tricky mind can mean mental experience. Ah meaning thought. And sometimes, this character can mean that but more broadly, particularly within the context of contemplative practice. It means consciousness In other words, what I would call sensory experience. So what is it? To directly touch. Sensory experience, too well it's to be in the moment right with sensory experience, so that is literally to touch the heart of the matter in the sense of well. Every inner or outer heaven or hell that anybody is ever going to experience involves experience with involves sensory experience so if we. No something that is universal to all moments of consciousness. If we know something about consciousness that is universal and deepen helpful with then we could say that we have touched the heart of the matter. As far as our own personal happiness goes. But there's also the warming of the heart. The contacting of the emotional self in a way that one is drawn to service and. Touching the emotional self in a way that one is able to deeply love. And based on that able to effectively act in the world. I would say that there is a very close relationship between these 2 forms of touching the heart. And. Spiritual. Grown Upness spiritual maturity, while there's many metrics many ways that we might measure it but one way would be. Um. The degree to which a person understands the relationship between these 2 endeavors of touching the heart. All. They're very closely related because when you touch the heart in the sense of. Contact the nature of consciousness, which is just another way to say contact the nature of see here feel. Of sensory experience. Uh. That. Connects you Directly. To the consciousness of all other beings, not as a concept, not as wishful thinking, belief, but as a? Inescapable moment by moment reality as you move through the world. Of that fundamental alienation the fundamental separation of inside and outside that rock solid concept that says my identity ends with my skin. Outside the skin is out, everything inside the skin and inside this head is in and that's me and there is a kind of. A brick wall that separates these 2 worlds and leads to fundamental alienation. Um. When you Touch the deepest part of. Or when a person you me anyone touches directly the senses. You discover that there's a commonality all sensory experience at the deepest level has the same taste. A karasa the one taste. And that one taste is universal. You are directly then connected to everyone else is consciousness. And. From that. Comes. Quite naturally, and easily a sense of. Uh. Loving. Towards each. Thing that manifests in front of you if if it's a physical object or it's another person. It could be a Saint. It could be a center it could be a beautiful flower or a smelly garbage can. Though on the surface of consciousness, they're all quite different. But at the instant of perception. What might be called the now in the absolute sense? And remember any duration is just a bunch of nails so there actually aren't any durations. There's only the nols. And Uhm. So. When you are in the absolute now. You can be aware of surface distinctions, but they're all pervaded by a deep unification and that unification not only unifies mind and body. Not only unifies sense and nonsense not only unifies pleasure and pain, but also unifies inside and outside. Um and Ultimately unifies. Uhm the The surface with the source it might say. Are true non dual awareness so?","title":"Touching the Heart"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/tracking-where-emotion-comes-from/","text":"Remind me that I had some other ideas of why can actually just tell me now and they're like nicely play it and go remember you listen to it, so the other thing is that OK one missing piece was well. The 2 flavors have to simultaneously flow and through each other another possible missing piece. Is that you're getting significant interaction with subliminal thinking? Right and you might want to look in that direction and the way you look in that direction. what I was going to have you work through work with is a special exercise that with all the years we've done. I'm not sure we've ever done. This one, but I'll ask you have. We ever done, noting feel sources? What that means is I have note if there's No Fear. You say No Fear if there is fear but it's not triggered by anything you're aware of you say just? Fear and then you specify if the fear has been triggered by fear from image fear from talk fear from sound feel from site or fear from touch. Now we have an Evernote noted fear. I call that noting field sources and field. I mean can be generic or specific that that was the next thing I had in the Hopper to try after this, because what may be happening is that you're getting significant triggering. From from other senses that are activating the fear in real time and usually what you know how I always say. OK, what is science in a nutshell? How much of what? When an where interacting in what ways and changing at what rates typically. I emphasize the what the where the rates of change, but some of the special techniques are designed to elucidate the interactions specifically what's triggering Watt and I find that when People are going through significant? Intractable fear experiences or emotion in general, but especially fear literally a few minutes of noting. What is triggering that fear in terms of broadly of the broad sensory categories so we can now detect No Fear fear but not a triggered by anything OK? Don't fear fear fear from image fear from talk and especially subtle image and subtle talk. The subliminal stuff, the way you know that's happening is you get a tug twords image space or a towards talk space. No content awareness at all but the next instant. There's a spike in the fear and the body now. You know that the sun. Quite aware of having that yeah, the subconscious well. It turns out if you ask yourself if you constrain yourself in real time to note did it come from image talk sight sound or the physicality of the body 'cause. It's gotta be one of those one of those, 5 right that. Keeping track of the of the whole system somehow that vastly reduces the over well.","title":"TRACKING WHERE EMOTION COMES FROM"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/transcendence-in-tribal-cultures-shinzen-young/","text":"Yes, in tribal cultures. This is interesting. Um. Tribal cultures typically do not have a technical vocabulary. For these kinds of things. Typically they do not have systematic exercises. That's characteristic of literary civilization literate literate civilizations. Why now so? The. When these tribal cultures encounter the elaborate. Philosophical and technological cultures of the modern world. Previously, there had been a tendency to sort of. Think of themselves as being less than because it's like wow. That's all you know all these ideas and and the literate cultures. Foster that notion and I don't just mean? Um imperialistic western culture, there's also imperialistic Chinese culture. I mean, it's a human thing OK. Now, but actually it's exactly the opposite. It's actually to the credit of those tribal cultures that they didn't have techniques and didn't have concepts in a sets why. Because they didn't need techniques and they didn't need concepts, they actually experience the stuff. As part of their daily life and as part of their rituals. Their ceremonies so whereas the literate. Cultures had words for things but weren't necessarily actually having experiences. The tribal cultures didn't need the words or the techniques life and ceremony sorted it for People. So. You so I would say you know it's not elaborated like that, yet Having said that look what's implied would just take one example of a tribal situation. The One I'm most familiar with which is Native American. Specifically, the Lakota or Western Sioux approach to things if you sort of look at the symbolism of the ceremonies. It's all. About. Complementary polarities the sacred object representative sacred object is the pipe that pipe has a bowl made of earth and a stem made of wood. And they are kept separate. The bowl stands for Mother Earth. Which is a contractive force? Speed stem stands for Father Sky, which is an expensive force. The tree grows up to the Sky. Eventually, the bowl goes back into the earth OK to its source. So you have these 2 actually holding in your hands the fundamental forces of the universe. And when you bring them together. OK then there's an empowering to do things when you do the Sundance you dance around A. Cotton wood tree or ASP in that and they their forked like that OK. So it's one becoming 22, becoming one that's what you're looking at for 4 days. When if you're There's different ways that People get pierced you may have seen in movies like that movie The man called horse. By the way, unlike in that movie you know, and screams and cries OK. But let's say you get pierced the way it's shown in that movie, so you get hauled up by these skewers. And you are. Now completely. At the mercy of. An expensive force of the Sky. That's pulling your flesh up the contracted force of the Earth. Those forces are totaly beyond what any human mind can deal with. So you just have to surrender to that and however long it takes for that which is caught in between the fundamental forces to give. Exemplified by about a square inch of skin on either side. You just have to wait and at the moment when it breaks. And you fall to the ground is when your prayer is delivered to the source so this sort of. Polarity thing is over the symbolically it's all there is there in the ceremonies. I've heard one. Medison person when you start a sweat lodge. You put 5 rocks in the center. Like that, so one medicine man, said that actually. The original Lakota way. Was there was just for rocks? Indicating the basic directions. Um. And the source. God Gosh Sheila was represented by the absence. But because People couldn't rap their mind around that they just they ended up actually pudding something there. Just to symbolize that so I could go on. Anon sorry for getting digress, but you asked about tribal cultures. I think it's there in the life. It's there in the symbolism. It's there in the ceremonies. It is not as I've ever been able to see, there in terms of. Organized techniques or philosophical concepts, but as I say I don't think that that represents a less than situation. I think it represents a better than situation. They didn't need that stuff. They just lived it or at least some of them. I'm not saying all our remote ancestors were like that, but is that a sufficient answer about tribal.","title":"Transcendence in Tribal Cultures ~Shinzen Young"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/undignified-on-youtube-perhaps/","text":"You did some unusual things in the course of these YouTube interviews and you did.

The precision the thoroughness, he has taking has done the work for all of us, both in terms of having a breath of experience in his own training being familiar with so many different contemplative approach is being having a scholarly approach so understanding world contemplative practices on that level having a scientifiche rigor because he partners with. You know hard science to do research around practice, so that gives us a tremendous framework to lean on and it makes our job as trainers, so much easier so there's that, but then there's also the fact that and maybe actually this is connected. There's the fact that in this space right now. You either have to take a deep dive into practice go whole hog and get certified and. You know spend years in training and years in the certification process, which is totally amazing and honorable. But the flip side of that? Is there really isn't anything other than that track so anybody who is in a helping profession and would maybe like to for example, a psychotherapist offering it as a complementary practice for their patients not their main thing. But something they'd like to share because they think it would be useful. So anyone basically who is in a helping profession or in a position to share it who would like to their on their own. You don't really have any kind of framework to lean on you have to just kind of watch. Other teachers do it and gather from that how to do it yourself. There isn't anything out there right now that speaks to you if you are either kind of less experienced or you want to you're going to helping profession and you want to offer it just as part of what you do. Or even if you're more experienced but you don't necessarily want to take a deep dive into full on certification program so I'm excited because this offers you a framework so that you can get the support you need in offering other People. This training so Lastly. It helps you go deeper with your own practice because you bring that level of clarity. Then, in order to be able to tell someone else about it, you really have to know.

So there's my plug for the People who brought him here and thank you to them for that work. And so I just wanted to talk to you about what it is. We were doing yesterday with these exercises.

But that you discover that there's an awareness that's already effortlessly aware and that I think is kind of the missing piece in the map. In western culture and is often in even Buddhism, another meditation systems. It's put off into kind of an esoteric or well. You really can't access that immediately. You gotta wait 3 years 30 years 3. Lifetime yes lifetime. You later flew. Meanwhile those who do have an awakening whether it's intentional or unintentional report back to us that. It's already here and it's already available within us so that's the premise that I was told, and then as a curious American New Yorker, well wait a minute, then if it's already here and it's iaccessible. Let's check it out. Let's see if we can are there groups and approaches and People and teachings that start or do a little more. Uh of accessing this recognizing and realizing this in the midst of daily life rather than going off to a monastery. So that's the premise, yeah have you been to a monastery lately? Well, it's I mean? It's great. But we can't all do that? Yes. And for those who do that. That's another approach, but is there. Another approach and what I discovered in kind of traveling around and being interested in this world of meditation psychology, and eventually the talk. I gave it Dharma teachers was on neuroscience and Meditationen Awakening so. You know really bringing kind of contemporary approach of scientific inquiry, which means what's true? What works what? What's actually happening are People really getting this? Is this an imagination or is this really changing peoples lives in a way that they're not only waking up. But they're growing up that's a kind of maturity integrity, compassion that is this possible an I think where I am now is. That, it really is possible in the midst of daily life. It's almost like the next natural stage of human development and then yeah, so it's evolution and potential. It's not esoteric only in that means that it's it's not it's paradoxical. Meaning it's not normal, the normal way we learn something by using our minds or informational is not the way you learn this. It's more like feeling how you write a bicycle. Did you come up with this way of presenting things or did you study with somebody? Who did it 'cause you have some simple exercises that like I don't think I've ever been to a workshop or a presentation where someone just said, OK, we talk, for a moment about stuff but then it's like OK. Let's try this OK feel that. Feel that there was like an literally 3 minutes later. Everyone is reporting the adjectives are citizen. Teachers like a high 5. You know it's like everyone's reporting. All these adjectives of openness. Freedom peace various things I got just from trying something right there in that moment now. Did you develop? These techniques or in looking from the beginning for? What is the goal? What is the result? What is thing that People. Call awakening or What is this? What is that about what does that give you? What is that mean? What changes what's absent? What's present you know, I started following that interesting. Premise to see who it is that would was talking about this and so then I kind of went around from Zen to vipasana to Tibetan Buddhism. Both's auction and mahamoud rhe, which is really where I ended up kind of many of the practices, or based on mom will drive but summer summer ISM but there's you can see that threat and some are just and then once once you start. I have a shift into this what's called recognition or realization, then it's kind of like awareness shows itself to itself. So there starts to be this curious almost like. Way that Oh well wait a minute. First time here and I'm contracted identified and then I'm open and then the openness. The body and then the openness is open hearted and then it's related but now I'm stuck in here, but now I'm stuck. I'm blessed in. I'm spaced out so How do I get from here to here and is there an intentional way or is that? Effort ING kind of a doing that keeps you from letting go so those kind of curious questions. But I didn't approach it intellectually. I approached it like. Palpable very experiential experiment like let's find out let's do it. Let's let's find the way to shift into it and find a way to live from it in the middle of for me in New York City. So if you can walk down the street there. You've got it, yeah, so now. I do it in the subway and it works, just as I said beginning of my practice New York. Yeah, it's a great opportunity. So so you so you did put this together used up at one thing that I'm especially intrigued by because of physicality is something that I'm very active with the kind of embodied person and I do a lot of movement work with a lot of physical modalities in the posture for meditation and how we communicate with our body and how we can allow our body to move in certain ways that effects how we think and feel. You know an you in this development as you. We're pulling from all these ingredients and cooking your own stuff, you actually came up with kind of movements. It's a physical way you have a journey from being in here to hurt you just talked about that progression and then it's really you ended up having us do an exercise actually moving from here to here that the heart out you had physical movements. We did which I thought for me personally. I thought there were 2 levels. This learning goes in. In addition, someone can say something, you can hear it. You can conceptualize it. You can even try moving your focus around but when you add this physicality for me. Once are physically moving. It's like a mood or something. It goes in my body in a different way with just a just using hands and arms to kind of help us bring us into it, but I liked that physical commitment to it, and the second was watching it, you'll be up there and I was thinking it's like he's conducting with this bot. We flew it very now you doing that, you're even started. I know I feel like my friend anyway, but but you know 'cause. We hear things and that's one I was watching this site that one part of the brain, but then we see you do it and visually. We get an impression. So there's the physical the feeling we hear the words and then we see it and so I thought is a way of your whole approach is about let's just do this right now there feel it. And so in it goes in in those 3 different modalities and see, hear feel is something that you know you know, I'm trained in those being 3 primary sense gates. So I was very impressed. But I liked. It was fun. It makes it is opposed to high. I'm going to go to get enlightened by 2:00 o'clock. It was really fun. I enjoyed this very much so in your personality is also you can get Woody Allen E sometimes. There's no or other you had other comedy People, you were doing in there, but so if you want to talk about this physicality on me, yeah, I mean, you know like you. I've also been always been kind of physical and played a lot of sports, so I would say 1 little story would be. One way that I discovered this was that I was in ice hockey goalie when I was very young how you need. Yeah, there OK. I think this sitting on the question you were with an ice hockey goalie, yeah, so I had discovered the way that I played best was would shift into another mode of perception. And then I heard on TV somebody talking commentator talking about quarterback and they said he's got eyes in the back of his head and I was like 14, so I was like he's got eyes in the back of the head. How do you do that you get that so I literally started developing this way I thought OK? Well, I can go this far. Let me continue bringing my awareness. Around this way, and as soon as I brought my awareness around to this 360 degree. Panoramic where NIS I opened up my panoramic and peripheral vision and then I dropped down into my body and their became this natural almost field of awareness where I felt like a cat and then I would just trust from there that I'd see see somebody take a slapshot but there be all these legs and all of a sudden. I just trust in my hand would shoot out and the puck would be in there and I figured OK, so rather than being. Hyper vigilant and one pointed in this effort effort in mind learn how to relax, but not relax let go to sleep. But there's another mode of perceiving that's called you know that People now called the zone or being in the flow. So the flow state. This is 14. This is the 1413. You do this, yeah, well. See he's been doing it a long time. So so I felt this and then I was explaining it to a friend who actually lives in LA and is going to come over. Open Roblox Oh and I was saying like well? How did you do that man and I started to put it into words and he was like Oh Cool? Great pass before you wanna beer OK, they really want really want that information. I have no idea what you're talking about. I was just asking you like just say something normal but then but then one of the seniors on the team. Over heard me and the next week. He came in and gave me this book. Zen and the art of archery, yeah, yeah. I said here kid. This is what you were talking about. Yeah, wow. At that age. She was new to read that yeah, Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance in opposite Duke in the art class. She never told us how to paint. You just sat there reading Zen in the art photos that there, you should go back and read it. But this and then I did send in the art of archery of that is so interesting well, what was you know. This panoramic vision and that is key to do what you do, but then the dropping down into what made you at the age of 14 because you just had to do something basically that's why you start to. I felt I felt that shift that when you open and then are doing something physical that all of a sudden the feeling is as if you're in every cell of your body. And the center is more like your gut your dantian or your heart. And you actually are you know optimally functioning without thinking about thinking right so all that information is processed in and then I then I realized OK. People talk about it in certain activities like sports or art, but can we do this in everyday life in relating an creating because often you'll see sports stars who get in the zone when they come out of it, there actually the opposite. Or you'll see artists or writers who can get in the zone and then all the sudden there life is a mess because the rest. They don't feel the way they feel not so you almost become compulsively addicted to that? Which. Take Sheldon Argus so I know I there are many actors who when they're acting they feel so alive and they will wait tables and do things for the rest your life just to get another few minutes of that hit of that high and when I try to save the meditation teacher. That's available in each moment that they think now I have to be on stage. They get that zone experience 2 things come to my one was the way I understood that samurai were trained. Was that they're not looking at where their opponent is or where the weapon is they actually go into a broad focus where they're not even looking at them, they're literally just kind of you go into an almost feeling of the environment and it's this kind of broad focus and I remember playing with that myself and realizing that there were times in which I was doing that driving can be once sometimes in driving. I'm just watching the kind of movement of everything the flow of. Visual field but what naturally happens is this extension out into space in a way where I'm part of the space. Yes, you know, I'm just one of the elements moving in, it, but this relational experience with everything it's like we're all one Organism and on one part of this larger Organism, but this getting back and bringing it into the body part. I do, find that wonderful is that mindfulness is coming into the Western World and it's. The Revolution Innocence is starting there and that's my hope for our planet at this time, but often the way in. It is we our minds. You know it's how we're thinking and the embodied aspect of it is sometimes just left out, yeah, and that's something that's so important to me and one of the reasons one of the reasons. I adore what to do it's just you know what you do is really like most style. I love it, but that you. You have said every time you'll say you talk about that. Panoramic awareness and then bringing it into the body and you know, I think of it is including like you know, kind of the way I just described it, but it's wonderful that you make that in your journey that note. It's gotta happen. And so could you just talk about that progression a little more so often? When People start with mindfulness, which is wonderful for stress? Relief and for kind of traditional preliminary practices and relaxation aspect in the body. People will like that's right. But some of the tools of the initial primary practices, or actually one pointed focus using using attention of the moving mind. And yet effortless mindfulness or more advanced practice. You're actually have to learn the other set of skills. You have to learn not only opening your awareness so that you're in the zone and trusting this non conceptual intelligence that is not checking with thought constantly and it's not a quick mind. But actually is mind that is made of more spacious awareness, so the 10:00 or even then. Big Sky mind you know this kind of thing and that the small sense of self, which is made of or the ego center, which is made of thought, referring to thought and creates a little character. Looking out of your eyes that feels like. It's looking at your eyes and feels like it's an entity. He does a lot of funding graphs on that. That that you know that is one way of functioning that's one way of operating but it's the little thought based ego center is just too small to deal with a full emotional life of full life of intimacy and. You know joy in the world, so we're not just so I realized that often the first step of stepping out of this. Ego center and into kind of either meditative state or even a bigger pure awareness is only part way there. But often important so the usual progression is com use focus to calm or com to focus and then that will come. The chattering mind and then to open up your meditative awareness or discover that there's kind of a bigger, more open mind. Open hearts, which is literally. The feeling you get not an intellectual idea, and then. You're kind of so the way I have People move is actually the feel like awareness can unhook from thought and then open to the space unhook from thought he always puts it that way. and I like that very serious like is there not just unhook. It's very it's just like you just visit and everyone goes Oh OK perfect. One of strange premise is that I realized that didn't even realize that was doing in the beginning, I thought in the beginning well. OK, but, yeah, the one who's unhooking is not the doers not the ego that's unhooking but then I just kind of kept going and then I realized Oh. I see what I'm doing. I'm actually act asking the awake person. The awareness that they already are that they've already been to unhook awareness from thought and that that awareness or that awake empty. Lucid clarity has a life already and actually has the ability to move and has a kind of intention aliti. It isn't just passive. And that often it's been defined as this passive you know recognition of awake awareness that you just sit in a meditative state and it's lovely and free of suffering, but then one day back to work from a long wait day retreat and you have the only option. You have is operating from ego center, so this is really about upgrading the operating system. A little tech jobs shield everyone, but literally stepping out of the current little small sense of self opening to space and then discovering that the awareness actually is discovering and aware mind? What's called nature of mind Big Sky mind. A pure awareness that is already aware and has already been aware both outside and then before you go in and there's someone could never have. I just want to say this. This isn't just like hi. I put it on the spiritual both for 12 years ago and now I'm trying. Chapter #17 someone could walk in and have never done anything and go through this. So it's appealing kind of directly in that way. But one thing I want to say about when you type up Big Sky might there's a space. I want to just kind of emphasize the speciality of it were here. No, we're not you really get the sense that no you are so that sense of that extended space of self. I just wanted for someone could just walk in there and go. My awareness is that big how can that be an again, he takes you right there experiential E into second so now continue on you go out just to say what you're saying 'cause. It's the most important point is that this awakeness that's both embodied and open hearted is already here and it's a consciousness. That's already installed in US, it doesn't have to be developed or created. But we haven't known how to access it so that's been my whole projects like wait a minute. Why do you have to do this and this and this to get to hear because once I'm here? Let me feel what it's like to lose it and then let me go back and shift back into it. Oh well, I didn't have to do those 8 things to get back. Let me see what is what is the map of consciousness experientially and then? How do you navigate it and then? How do you translate it to somebody and make the language more contemporary and more experiential so that that's kind of what I've been doing is like translating translating translating not just text. But like what's your New Yorker direct get it is it here. Get to the point. Let's go? What's needed, and no more, yeah, and do it like you learn, you know take care of your consciousness, the way you learn to eat or whether you go to the gym or you do yoga posture. It's like. Sometimes they called the yoga of awareness so but the interesting thing is which is what I'm coming back to now is that what it is. That's moving and what it is that knows this ground, which is pure awareness. Is only awareness and that's why most People have missed it? Is because we're trying to effort it? We're using our will? We're using our mind and we're even using attention of the mind, which we actually can't see it nor can mindful witnessing see the pure awareness, so even that which pulls back and is able to observe thought can't turn around. It's actually has to be that which is already made of the non local awareness. That's locally attached for identified that can drop that can open from thought and then discover itself as kind of. Non local awareness and be aware. Of itself without thought and without senses just from it just doesn't have to do it. That long it doesn't have to be a long retreat or half hour meditation. It just needs to plug in or surrender or tune in to that which is already been aware and then as that which is aware the next important move is the intention aliti realizes Oh. Form is emptiness now emptiness is form. So the awareness realizes it's aliveness and the feeling of the ocean appearing as waves of consciousness is where you drop back in and you have a? It's like you've shifted figure ground of what's awake, what you're aware of then you can be aware of all your thoughts feelings sensations, but you're aware from this huge loving supportive inside outside is the same and you're free of the anxious perpetually dissatisfied commentator. So we could just stop right now. Yeah, yeah, got everything and then one more one more thing is that so then when there's no SIM bodied kind of continuous field of awareness that's primary. The anxious anxiety is gone about anxiousness and the judging but you still have your full range of emotions. You're not detached. But you just was there anything in a flow state, which more optimally function and you've dropped not only into your body but. You've dropped from head to heart mind so it's a feeling that People even if I don't describe it. They say, and I love the term Hartline juicy? what I was going to just say 2 things real quick, one was when you just described at 9:00 plotted but you talked about the loving supportive and I remember I came up to him after an intermission. Or maybe it was after the Friday night thing you did, and I said when he was describing it and I thought you know. When I first learned Buddhism in airtight refuge. I thought that's what they were talking about it because I thought that is the ultimate roughing yes and it is the ultimate refuge that even in Buddhism. You start with Buddha and then you start with or you start with your guru or your teacher take refuge in the Buddha. The Dharma the Sangha and then you start with and then you realize Oh the teachers outside. Oh no, the teachers inside and then some. Tibetans do like Oh, there's a DD, but on the DD melts into you and then. Your eyes is that so ultimately, it is in the systems. Ultimately, the refuges. The Dow or the Buddha Nature true nature or if it's like a direct path to the ultimate.","title":"Upgrade to an Awake Operating System ~ Loch Kelly with Stephanie Nash"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/upiah-skillful-means-or-outreach-shinzen-young/","text":"The Bell stems for pia or Carter now. So Cardona means compassion, but it's bigger than compassion, it's really outreach. That's why in the Tibetan tradition, Cardona and opiah our virtual synonyms. Current odds compassion and who pia I would translate as it's often translated what's the standard sort of booted artificial Buddhist. English translation of pia mean means you got it. So what is but what does skillful means refer to what? What is the connotation of the word? Higher well if I were to give an idiomatic translation. I would probably translate it something like outreach. Remember, I said that when you ring the Bell you bring the Bell to call People or you ring the Bell to begin or end. A sent to me. That's like the coolest job to do because you're reaching out the Bell. It calls sentient beings back to the source back to the practice. So I would say Pia is the ways that one reaches out. In order to engage people in the practice because just sort of trying to sell People on emptiness or suffering. Oh, that might be maybe something the general public doesn't exactly relate to right off the bat guess. Wat I've got good news. You are soulless robot designed to suffer and too stupid to know that you're going to die, that's not so great, because it's almost certain that the next time around. You're going to be bored as even stupider. Something there's damn good reason to say this. I don't know about the reincarnation piece, but actually yeah. I agree with the solar's robot designed to suffer but that's not exactly the whole picture for Fortunately. And so and that is certainly not a way to bring in J randomly human being in the path and just try to convince some of that. That's like the Iceman Cometh. You know you're trying to sell a person on. Yes, it's like who wants to buy this product so. Uh. There are more approachable ways of formulating the same thing and that's compiled so the Buddhist tradition is always. I thought that it's important to make ways that People can enter the practice. Now, how do you do that? Well, it's been done differently in different cultures? One of the ways let's be honest that you get People engaged is you impress them with psychic powers of magic. That's something People can relate to in certain cultures at certain times. Most cultures in previous times and that's where Buddhism existed in those cultures, so you know, I mean. How how are you going to convince Kubla Khan to you know not destroy your temple but help you build it OK? Well, you better be able to do magic better than his guys so that was one of the UP's and it certainly is legitimate. I suppose within a certain cultural context. People like to have their fortune told you go to it, I mean? You know. Fortune could we talk about fortune cookies, OK, so it's almost like a stereotype, but fortune telling is am really, really old Trope in Chinese culture, although actually most People don't know the fortune cookies. Come from Japan has originally most People don't know that, but look at the WACA. Pedia is ready come from, but anyway, fortunes telling your fortune. That's the beginning of Chinese literature. That's the gin. That's what it is. That's like how to interpret these hexagrams and so forth so the culture like step. Their fortune told so every Chinese temple. If you talk to the average Chinese person what do you do at the temple? Why do you go to the temple well? You you throw these pieces of wood or coconut and they fall in a certain way. And then you like draw a fortune and OK. So it goes so that's an empire that brings that brings People into your temple. Food is a big deal in Chinese culture. So Um Miatta Buddhism in China is about not eating meat. So you develop an incredible vegetarian cuisine and the temples provide that food so People go. They get a good vibe. They do a good deed. They didn't eat meat, but they eat something that looked and tasted exactly like weed. It must be out of tofu and all they reproduced all the high cuisine of China in vegetarian food OK. It's a new pia. It brings someone into the temple and then. Hopefully. Some connection will be made, and from there things things will happen. So that's all this kind of stuff is looked upon is pia. Pia is sort of tricky thing right. I think you could see that there could be a little bit of a slippery slope here in terms of honesty. You know, People like miracles, so Hey, you know miraculous things happen. Yeah, you know these. What do they call them? Uh. You know the relics and things that reproduce themselves every day and get more and more and more you know, I can't help thinking that someone is manipulating that OK but well it's an empire, it can be justified. So it's a sort of tricky thing. We want to bring people in We want to build things relevant urine. 12 century Japan you just came back from China. You learn this cool, Liberation Path called Sean or then and who's running the show in 12 century Japan summer I. They are running the show. So how are you going to get them not to beat you up but rather to get interested in what you have to say. Well, what's relevant to a summer I. To kill and be killed without fear or consciences was relevant to the job of a samurai. You know what we can provide that I want that we can provide that now. You could say wow. That was a bad thing to do I mean, the Buddha would like? I mean, it's like in the original rules in the Vinaya Buddhist monks aren't even allowed to talk about. Wars and conflicts want to say to train Warriors. On on the other hand. Thanks to that. There are now people in Japan, who are enlightened Zen Masters and taught me. And maybe if that hadn't happened in the 12 century. That would not have been the case. Uhm I remember the first time I ever stayed in the Japanese and temple. It was a place called mom pujian kill Tal. And they? When I notice was that these busloads of. Co workers would come here. It would be like a giant like 3 buses and they're all workers from a certain section of a company like Mitsubishi or? Matthew star or you know, one of these big Japanese companies they'd all be like in suits or in their company sort of. What do we call those like? Like. Yeah, or the? When can the jumpsuits kind of things and I notice like these coming into the temple? What's going on so I asked the roshi? What is this and he says? Well, they they bring in they send a section of workers? To spend a week. Living in the sand temple together. Essentially to do up a mini session that sort of mild retreat kind of situation. But mostly just like being the temple and see what that's like. So. I said why while why just why did the companies do this? This is a long, long time ago this is like 1969 or something 1968? Way back my first time I was in Japan. So why did the why did the companies send their workers? Well, it's a team building exercise when it is. This is Japanese team, building set up to his end temple and toughen him up a little bit. You know it. Hurts you have to sit still and you're tired and you get a sort of paramilitary team building kind of experience that's why the companies do this, they pay for it because. It's to their advantage as a company. So OK fine. It's sort of cool actually in a way that that's that's their version of team building sort of class classical on the other hand, I did ask the guide pointedly don't you think that they're exploiting. You. You know it just using you for corporate goals your spiritual teacher. Your Zen teacher. You know in those days. I was pretty rude. I haven't done much practice. I had a lot of hot spot and I used to like to ask important questions for People, but that was OK. 'cause I actually learned a lot by the answers because often the answers were I was important, but the answers were humble. And that was a learning experience so he said. Well, it's true. To a certain extent. But. If we get 60 People coming in here. Um maybe 1 or 2 of them. Will take to the practice? And will continue with it. And that justifies doing it, so and then he said, This is whole band. And the whole Ben is the Japanese word for rupaya so this is the outreach so you reach out to People. Zen and the art of People like to do art in Japan, they would like to do flower arranging and tea ceremony. So we use sort of make the possibility that they can get a little bit of somebody as they are doing their art. Their Flowers or their tea or whatever and then this makes things relevant to the culture. So. What I find interesting is that of course history repeats itself? Now it's coming to the West. Um. How is it making by it? I mean? Buddhism this practice how is it making a really I mean like really significant inroad into the culture? How is that happening? Um. It's happening because of the M word, and buy em, I don't mean meditation. OK, what's the M word that I'm thinking of movies, no mine mine mine. So yeah, that one this is amazing mindfulness. That word. Will probably change the course of human history? That word. No just the way it's come down now. Uh. Because. Mindfulness is unintentional skill set. It can be in. Translated different ways, but it's an attentional skill set. And. These attentional skills can be used for uh for everything that could be used for everything they can be used for pain management. They can be used for improving your tennis game, they can be used for recovery. Could be used for everything? And it's not terribly threatening. The other M word. It's pretty accepted I mean, even the AMA when you get something if you have heart or cancer or something, as the AMA recommendations that M word meditation word. You'll actually find there so that's Somewhat acceptable the meditate the N word that means meditation, but still out there are sections of society that meditation just sounds weird and and. An invasion of my personal world. It's like asking someone to pray in a certain way you're asking them to Meditate. But. Telling People Hey, we're going to give you some exercises that develop attentional skills. And then we're going to show you how to apply those attentional skills to what you're interested in. What's important to you if you got chronic pain, but that's important, OK, etc, etc. That's something that the average person is not not going to. And it's not going to catch in their crop, it's not going to seem. Weird or unnatural, especially one of the things that I've been considering is to not assume that the 1st way you train people in mindfulness is to get them to sit down. 'Cause there's really nothing that says, Yeah, you have to start with a seated practice or that your eyes have to be closed. Without this is really interesting because this to me, this is the modern who pia. We're reaching out to People now, what I decided to do was OK if. If we're flying under the banner of unintentional skill set. Well, we want. Them to apply these skills. In a way that they are going to dramatically grow so. The base, I outlined this in the what is mindfulness, but they sold strategy is so the categories of the basic mindfulness system are designed to produce insights right off the bat. So that it's not just that they're going to get a little bit of of concentration kind of thing, but there explicitly developing concentration sensory clarity equanimity and they're learning how to parse their sensory experience in such a way that the fundamental insights can arise without of us trying to get them to leave a certain thing. So we're going to provide you with an intentional skill set. We're going to provide you with the way of. Analyzing your sensory experience, which is not any doctrine or belief system. It's obviously is the case that we see and we here and we feel. And then People can hopefully start to have. Really significant experiences. So. That to me is the is a modern incredible opportunity for Empire.","title":"UPIAH - Skillful Means or Outreach  ~Shinzen Young"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/vermont-news-comic-skit-by-stephanie-nash/","text":"id: vermont-news-comic-skit-by-stephanie-nash title: 'Vermont News' - comic skit by Stephanie Nash hide_title: false sidebar_label: 'Vermont News' - comic skit by Stephanie Nash Oh, this Justin we have an on the scene live report from Melanie Mash in Burlington. Thanks Bob I am here on the West side of Burlington, Vt just outside the force next to Lake Champlain. A possibly homeless man who locals have reported often meanders and the very well maintained path of the forest and is reported to go by the name the head chin or the big Shin was seemed drunkenly walking down the path muttering 123456789. Ten 123456789 ten and he kept waving and pointing to a piece of paper with nonsensical symbols on it. Muttering that it had his whole system on there and that he looked at it every day and that it was the solution to Mick Dharma. He was in a trench coat, which he called his robes and wearing a sign that said on the front think dimensionally and on the back optimize the happy. Then he returned to this kind of Spastic, walking telling the crowd that he was auto walking and that they should try auto thinking so that they could meet Gus were not sure who Gus is possibly an imaginary friend. Everyone assumed at this point that the man was intoxicated and then he started marching and chanting Trump is outdo. Obama is empty and that's when a real crowd started to gather assuming it was actually a political rally. People wanted to join in the chant but were confused as to which side he was on when someone asked him he stopped and looked at them and said. The source and so are you and everything is loved into existence in each moment. At which point they assumed this wasn't political after all, but that he was a religious fanatic, but then he asked. If anyone had some kickapoo joy juice and then said that he had been abducted by aliens who did a lot of **** probing. Yes, Bob that's when they realized he was delusional in the authorities were called. And then he returned to the counting and walking only to stop and declared that he had no self, which had a bounciness and connectivity and then he proceeded to say he could see hear and feel while waving his arms in pretending to have a theory by this point. There was a huge crowd around him who seemed to be enjoying this display. Some were even drawn in and soon others were walking around chanting 123456789 ten. And that's when we arrived Bob and I tell you I have never seen anything like it. I I think the guy was just some kind of hypnotists when the police arrived, they came towards him and he said he wanted to wrestle like he did with his TA when he was stoned and that's when one officer approached him slowly, saying that everything was going to be OK to which the man said it was more than OK. Everything was in folded within expansion and contraction, which arose out of. Uh then returned to the source. Then he pointed to a garbage can and insisted he could merge with it. The officer said that he wanted the man to get into the car and then the man called the big shin pointed to the card, said he had been in one of those, and that it had rolled over and over and slid under a semi and that was how he lost his ear, but it wasn't a bad trip. Oh yes, Bob he seemed to have both his ears. The officer then asked if there were drugs involved and the big Shin said. Yes, LSD, but then he giggled and confided that no one knew well. The police officer assured him that now. He knew and that they needed him to get into the car. The man asked if instead, they could go on a motorcycle at 100 mph with no self driving. Or pretend it was an ox an ride backwards and the officer said no to which the man pretended to ring a Bell and then said that car is empty. The officer then said that the empty back seat was going to be full in a moment and asked the man if he could see how many fingers. He was holding up the man then approached the officer look deeply into his eyes and in a slow meaningful way asked the officer. Who is saying? Whereupon the officer disappeared. Vanished I kid you not Bob then the man the big shin pointed quickly and shouted gone. Well, the entire crowd erupted in applause. Assuming this was all part of a Magic Act. This it all just been a show and. And a good one to Bob I must say well. The Vig Shin as well. Now call him turned to the crowd and told them that he had a book on how to do this. But that it was in R&D. And for now. Everyone could just apply CC&E liberally and they, too, could return to the source. Then the officer reappeared but no longer wanted to arrest the man and instead wanted to ask him more about his source. The officer seemed like a different man Bob and told us all to have some compassion and to love deeply and act affectively which. Coming from a cop is quite something to hear. Then the officer in the man conford after which the officer bowed to him. My kid you not Bob you simply cannot make this stuff up. And then the big shin turned to the crowd and said, and this is a direct quote. On the epitaph of civilization will be that subtle emotional sensations that went undetected did them in. But we could do something about that and feel in with clarity equanimity. An concentration, noting activity and rest and also vibration and by having a complete experience of this. We could find true freedom and fulfilling Bliss. And be patient it takes time and know that the first bite of emptiness is like biting into an Apple that's right. The taste and texture of the skin is not what's inside. And no matter how long it takes it's worth the ride. And all shall be well and all manner of things shall be well. If we appreciate transcend and in positive iti dwell. And in the mean time, be a Mensch and just think of. That inside the jewel in the Lotus is love. And on that note. He expanded and contracted until he too disappeared and the crowd. Now the audience just stood there was weird. Because we were all quite confused, but also happy and felt good. From this strange little man at the edge of the Woods. And I realized that I'm now talking in rhyme. But I trust Bob that this two will pass with time, so this is Melanie mash signing out from this event. It was odd and bizarre, but we all leave content.","title":"Vermont news comic skit by stephanie nash"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/watching-subconscious-processing/","text":"But. Bot bot. There's another possibility. And this one is yet another subtlety, but it is so cool once you get it. OK and I'm not sure this is what you're talking about, but it's something that I have to talk about. OK. So, sometimes I'll Be working with the first time are there doing focus in and they elect to do it with inclusive noting it's just I give them the option and it's like. Hey, you know it's going to be sort of complicated. Now it's natural. I want to do it that way. Great. So we're doing CN Urine Feelin. See here in the sea feel in your field in all in. Gone all rest. Pawn. And the person reports this. Um. It's not all rest. Um. It's not, but I I can tell you whether what it is OK. I can't say it, see in here in feo in or what combination but it's not all rest. It's not that. There's no image no talk no emotion in the body. It's not all rest, but I can't tell you. What's going on? Sounds like a problem. But actually it's not a problem. It's the beginning of something really cool. On. What's happening on So what you say is? OK. You. You're not aware of explicit image talk or emotional body. But those spaces. Are also not in a restful state? What's going on? Or what do you think is going? Seattle process. Subconscious processing. So the whole western psychological tradition is based on Freud's quote discovery of the subconscious. How guess Wat. People in India knew about the subconscious. Two 3000 years before there was a Floyd in Europe. Ah am they knew how to observe the subconscious in real time. Now you can't observe the subconscious visual auditory in somatic the way you observe the conscious because by definition, it subconscious. Um. However, you can be aware when a burst of activity arises in Subconscious thought and emotion, and you can be aware when that burst of activity passes. On. How are you aware of that? Well sometimes you're aware because of a shimmering on the screen that tells you that the rolodex is being flipped through deep down where there's this sort of undercurrent of talk. Anna it's massively parallel like listening to a room full of People. You can't make out any strand of a conversation but you know. Stuff going on down there. Same for this sort of like a idling in your emotional centers. Nothings engaged you can't say it's anger fear sadness but. Speed the emotional centers are sort of an Idol you can actually see it in a baby. You can see the. The amoeba that is the. The idling of the Olympic circuits in a baby. The baby is not crying. The babies not smiling OK but the baby is sort of. This kind of stuff OK that's their body, responding to. The sub threshold activations. Of the limbic system. OK let's just expanding and contracting while still there in adults. So one way that you can know that you can monitor in real time, these systems. Is by noting sort of subtle activities subtle flow within them? However. This is the part that's really cool and really subtle. You may not even be aware of that undercurrent. Or something. But you're aware. That image space is tugging. Talks spaces tugging you. Emotional feeling spaces, tugging it, but there's no no awareness of any activity that there's an awareness of a tug of space. That's why it's so important to have a sense of the locations of the spaces. So. When it's not you're doing focusing and it's not all rest. You will notice that the non rest is that you're being tugged towards 1, two or all three of those spaces. That is the queue that there is a very at that instant. Kind of the subconscious mind has started to activate. In one tour all three of those spaces. All you an you note that as CN here, and feeling even though so it's not all rest. There's no explicit activity that you're aware of not even though Vibra. Tori flow, but there is this tug. That's why this triangle OK. There's a ton here there's a tongue here there's like a tongue down here or all three of months or what have you that tongue when your emphasis is on detecting interactivity that counts as the sub list level of interactivity and you just say yes, even though you don't know what you're saying yes to you say yes to the Top and guess what? At some point that's all that the subjective system needs. It just needs you to say yes to its amoeboid subliminal fluffs and you go back to that state of the baby. And that's the extent to which the ego needs to be a thing for you, which ain't much of a thing. This was hugely subtle. Don't worry. I'll say it again and again and again.","title":"WATCHING SUBCONSCIOUS PROCESSING"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/welcome-to-this-shinzen-videos-youtube-channel/","text":"Hi I am Stephanie Nash, an I started this YouTube channel in 2009.

Thus, the name of this channel has been chinzan interviews for a long time and it may still show up for you is that we did change the name Titian's and videos. I started adding talks an teaching sessions from retreats. In addition to the interviews and. I also wish incense wholehearted approval and encouragement. I have posted bits if interviews.

Behind the necessary cause. And the necessary cause that is behind a necessary cause is completely neural physiological in nature. Then there could be interventions that directly address that a neurophysiologic, so you knockout you knockout the physiological. Necessary condition for Tom Ha therefore you knockout unha therefore, you knockout. What blocks perfection? So theoretically are potentially any piece of research into craving. If it were done very deeply might unlock. A key physiological mechanism. What I find interesting is that you can get you can't get much funding for research on enlightenment? But you can get funding for research on drug addiction. That's funny and But if research on drug addition were were too. Go very, very deep and very, very broad. It's possible that the necessary cause for Tom Heart could be found. And eliminate it. Which would mean if we take the Buddhist model that? There would be a physiological and don't ask me what time 'cause. I don't know if I did know I get the Nobel Prize? I have no idea is it? Is it some super kind of biofeedback is it. F MRI biofeedback isn't TMS stimulation is it on what they call dreads which it sounds bad. But there like these now. It's designer designer drugs for designer receptors. It's like the cutting edge of the cutting edge of neuroscience. Anyway, who knows Watt, but if there were a way to knocked out the necessary cause for the necessary cause that it was purely physiological than Nirvana would actually simply happen now, what I find the delicious notion is that? You can get funding for craving research and you could get funding for deep and broad, craving research and you could get funding from Republicans gladly for deep and broad, craving research. Therefore, it could come to pass that Republicans response are become responsible for the entire world of becoming Buddhist.

I know it. It helps build it but what if you don't even have enough to stay keep your focus there for? Five seconds Well, everybody else, everyone has to start somewhere. If you think of the analogy to a workout. Well, if you've never worked out the very first time you workout you get winded in light. 2 minutes right and it's like Oh my God, at this rate I'll never get anywhere. What you don't realize is that the growth is not linear it's somewhat hockey stick OK so that you grow faster as you grow more so it's true initially that you might very well have the experience that you're describing which is just like. I'll never get this 'cause you know it's like I'm here 1% of the time in 99% of the time. I'm like lausten ruminations and worrying about body sensations, and the sounds, yeah, memory plan fantasy that's my that's memory plan. Fantasy reaction judgment when I decided I was going to like OK. I'm going to be healthy. I'm going to run so I was 21 years old, but I. Never really worked out or done anything I run down the block and at the end of the block. I'm late and it's like Oh my God. I mean, I'll never be able to run more than a block. But within 2 months. I was running miles right. It was a dramatic change, so initially. Yes, you may have to put up with that, but everyone has to start somewhere. Another way to look at it is if you never start, then you'll have to live your entire life in a scattered state a nun. Recollected state as the Christians would say you know, my quoted TS Eliot before he's got this great phrase. Where he says. This is a place of disaffection, meaning ordinary experience right. This is a place of disaffection. Then he goes on and eventually says distracted from distraction by distraction People are so distracted they don't even realize they are distracted. So distracted from from distraction by distraction that's how you're going to have to live your whole life and it's going to be time to die really quick. And then you will not have lived and you'll freak out, so you gotta start somewhere. So the bad news is yes. You might have to put up with what you're describing for awhile like getting a stitch when you first try to workout but things get better with practice. If you don't do something like that, you'll basically just live your life just in that distracted state, meaning you won't really live your life, you'll if you're not focusing on what's relevant back to your concentration model? Exactly when you can either say, Oh my God. This is awful. I'm able to focus 10% of the time and 90% of the time I'm away so you could. Make that a problem or you can make that an insight. You can realize Oh. This is how it must be directed. I am this is how most People live this is how I would have lived otherwise. So you never really been president you're spending the present thinking about the past and the future essentially that's the human condition. At least this at this point in history and what that means is is that People don't fully live each moment and therefore they don't really live there. If your present if you discover when you first attempt to meditate that it's 90. 9 to one one unit of focus versus 9 unit of distraction. That means that you're missing 90% of your life. That's the bad news and when it comes time to die. You won't have lived and you'll freak out. On the other hand, the good news is with practice. You can get it reversed is it does it take 2 months like it did for you to run 2 miles it takes longer typically like if someone 6 months to a year? What's regular. I would say 10 minutes each day and at least 4 hours of intensive continuous practice per month. That's why I have the whole practice program so People can call by Phone. Wherever they are in the world and ask about that later. Maybe we should finish. It later just finish up this one thought. So the bad news is that if you may have what might be called a sobering realization when you first try to Meditate, which is it's like like I say it's 99. You know 90% of the time I'm not I'm unable to focus. Well, with enough practice you can eventually reverse that so you're 90% focused OK. So we've basically multiplied your ability to be present by a factor of 9, well so that means you get to live life 9 times as big as the average human being. And when it comes time to die, you will have participated enough in life. But that you won't freak out, you will have completed your life activity, so that if I were to tell a person Hey. Give me 10 minutes each day subtract 10 minutes each day from your life and every month. Subtract 4 hours and keep that up for the duration and I'll be able to live to be 300 years old that would be. Sound like amazing right, yeah, well. That's not possible. You can't add 100 and 200 and however. Many years to a person's life. However, what you can do is multiply your ability to be present in each moment and you can do that dramatically. As the result of that you'll get to live life to 3, four times as big as you would otherwise and the effect will be the same richness as though you live to be 100. Two hundred or 300 and that's actually doable by anyone so formal meditation practice subtracts a little bit of time from your life, but it multiplies. The richness and depth of the rest of the time so as we say do the math. It's a good deal.","title":"What if you have no concentration  What are the benefits of concentration"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/what-is-enlightenment/","text":"Can you tell me what enlightenment is so? Moment by moment you've probably noticed that you have thoughts right. Soccer it and moment by moment you probably notice that you have body sensations. You've also probably notice that as soon as a thought arises or a body sensation rises. There's a tendency to say this thought is me. At this sensation is me. Is that correct nothing mysterious so far? The next part, you have to sort of use your imagination. Imagine that you still had thoughts and you still had body sensations, but they? No longer immediately trapped your identity. So, your identity is free free to be inside your mind and body like it was before, but also free to move outside of your mind and body to inhabit briefly anyone's mind and body to merge with them. Or to embrace the entire universe. Or to abide the still point of the turning world beyond time and space. Nothing us that precedes The Big Bang so to speak metaphorically speaking so. After Enlightenment, People's identity becomes elastic. And the mind and body is no longer. A place you're locked in it's a home you comfortably can abide in but you can leave anytime you want. And that's why we also call it liberation being set free.","title":"WHAT IS ENLIGHTENMENT"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/what-is-equanimity/","text":"So equanimity sounds like being cooled out and attached but actually as we would define it in the mindfulness tradition. It's radical non interference with the natural flow of sensory experience, so if you have. Emotions in the body you don't push them down. But you don't latch on to them inappropriately either. It's a sort of non pushing and pulling a hands off. With regards to the flow of your senses which does not for a moment imply a hands off. With regards to the flow of events in the world. You can be very, very proactive and even pushy with regards to. Circumstances and conditions, but equanimity means that you're not pushing and pulling the natural operation of your senses your sense is defined as external site external sound physical type body sensations meant your mental images your internal talk and your emotional body sensations. You'd let touch sight sound feel image talk expanded contract as they wish without interference. Let me just make sure. I get that right so equanimity is my experience. Thoughts and feelings and body sensation. How I'm experiencing the world in terms of sight and sound I'm just letting that? Happen in watching that kind of flow. I don't know like waves or something but that's separate from my wanting to do an action in the world to change things. Yes, In other words, as you become passive innocence. With regards to in the sense that you're passive in the sense that you don't fight yourself. Your train another way to look at equanimity is its trading your sensory circuits, not to interfere with themselves so you could compare it to. If your sensory experience is the engine of a car equanimity is oiling. The engine so the parts don't grind against each other, causing being in the weo that we're going for it can lead to an experience of Fluidity, but sometimes it can lead to an experience of solidity because you're willing to let things melt and freeze. There's another TS. This is going to be TS Eliot time there's another TS Eliot Line. Mid Winter Spring is its own season. Between melting and freezing the soles SAP quivers. You have to be willing to melt an freeze the equanimity is equanimity with whatever form the senses take, but what equanimity does is it's a skill. Yeah, so it's another way to look at it is. It's learning to love every sensory experience as it arises but not to hold onto it inappropriately as it passes? How do you develop that skill I'd like that one everyone would because it's a good skill? Yeah, it's a good skill points, all have some equanimity. I concur and why it's a good skill is you'll discover that when you have equanimity with pain. It still hurts but it doesn't bother you and when you have equanimity with pleasure. It not only feels good. It satisfies you. People think they want to be free from pain and to have pleasure. But what they really want is to be free from pain being a problem and to have pleasure that gives satisfaction and it turns out that the quality of equanimity. Does that so when you say yeah? I'd like? Yeah, it's like that joke it's like? I'd like to have like, she's having yeah well. That's the equanimity is definitely something that People desirable highly desirable and effect. More than desirable may be absolutely essential. If you have some physical and or emotional pain that cannot be gotten rid of by changing circumstances or biannual jesiah. Or psychotropics or whatever, then you've got a choice of either developing equanimity or being mired in abject suffering. So definitely equanimity is not only desirable it may be pivotal to making a life worth living under certain circumstances.","title":"What is Equanimity"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/what-is-love-at-the-deepest-level/","text":"What should we do? To make this world a better place. People often ask me what you know, there's this circumstance with that condition. In the world. Um. So. I find myself, saying. As it I can't help people with the specifics. I don't know the specifics of politics or how things should work in the world. But I do know some general principles that I think hold it in all cases. And the way I sum it up is the phrase that I used at the end of the last stop, which is love deeply and act effectively now acting effectively. Is uh is related to your mindfulness skills? And strategies, but That's not the whole picture of acting effectively acting effectively involves a lot of things, but mindfulness skills and strategies do enter rim. All. Loving deeply. Uh. Critically depends on mindfulness skills and techniques so. We. Always are asking. What is love? Um. And we're always sort of seeking something. Um. Is? Taken me decades to have a confident answer out with regards to the question. What is love at a very deep weapon? I don't think I can confidently answer it at more superficial levels that would be other kinds of experts would talk about that. But I do have a confident answer as to what it is. Out a very deep level, maybe the deepest level. So. We channel is Montrae. O'Malley puppy who Halo to the jewel in the Lotus. So if you think of. Love is this. Fragrant colorful. Attractive flower. Is there in the center of it something? That is its essence that could be called the jewel that's hidden inside that Lotus. And I would say yes. And I would say that I can put it into words. I. I'm also tempted not to put it into words because the words are likely to be a let out until there is an experience that. That goes with those words. So the the description is. Sort of. Come. Not all that poetic. Um. How do we know that there's a world? Well, we see it. We hear it, we touch it. And we think about it. Of course when we think about it, we See it here comments about it bad words about it, we have emotional. Sensation so. Through inner and outer activity, we have the perception that there is a world. And through those same sense gates, we have the perception that we have a self. So. As you are mindfulness skills develop? It becomes possible to have a more and more complete experience of inner and outer see, hear feel. That means an experience with. Progressively greater sensory richness, but also progressively less moment by moment fixation. That leads to at paradoxical experience. Which is? Une experience of maximal richness. Because it's getting richer and richer and richer. But at the same time, minimal something nahs. Because the amount of time that you're fixating any particular part of it is getting shorter and shorter and shorter. So at the limit. Of. Add clarity and equanimity. Um. Is the experience that is optimally? Rich. And also utterly vacuous at the same time. And can you put into words what that's like? Short, but as I say it's likely to be a bit of a let down. What it's like is? That there is an absolute rest. Where in Time, and space collapse to a dimensionless point. That has no position. And then that. Breaks apart. And the positive spreads and the negative pull Zune. There's a simultaneous expansion and contraction like a space fountain. Then spreading and collapsing it's the fountain of youth. Constantly, own it's gushing and gathering. An it's Shimmering. Vibrant space. And if you stay with that. Uh. You have everything you ever wanted. And you have absolute safety you're being held by your cosmic parents. Your physical parents would have been. Hey. A representation. Of this cosmic parenting. Ah. But most People don't notice that even though it happens, thousands of times a day. Each Sunday. See the world. Order themselves or Here, or touch or think. Or move or speak. Just before. This happens. So People don't notice it number one and #2 it get that. Scintillating missed. Coagulates into inner and outer see her feel. And there's a sense of. And I met his vulnerable and. Frost and Um. Disconsolate. Not getting what it wants. And there is a sense of and it. That is fundamentally alien and. Threatening. Call the world or the other. Um. So. The jewel in the Lotus. Um. When you unfold the pedals and look at what's on the inside. When we say we're experiencing. Human love, Beard of the physical kind or any other kind. But it's the human love well the human love is that is that flower. And certainly that has its place. In the nature of things, but it's also important to. Have a deeper context where by you. Understand this nonhuman love. That is hidden within. Always want. Anne is available all the time. So. Um. To love deeply means. That. Before. That you are aware. That love always comes 1st. You can't. Have any reaction. Of any sort whatsoever. Without first having a perception. Over yourself in the world except. At the origin of each perception of self and world. Is this this? Deep love, So if you come in contact with this. That means that all of the decisions that judgments are the reactions, there still going to happen like they always do. But there is an inescapable context. That proceeds so that then colors. Your response is. It doesn't mean that you no longer judge. Or that you can't take action or that you can't. Um confront Or oppose. It doesn't militate against any of that. But it just puts it in a different context. So. Let's say that there's something going on in the world that you think is bad. And action needs to be taken to change this. Certainly legitimate. Um. If you're able to love deeply. That's going to have a huge effect on acting effectively. Um. Unfortunately, the bad news is. Most humans have not yet learned how to love deeply. So. Because loving deeply means hundreds of times in the day. Whenever you perceive the other the enemy. The source of the problem. Then. It. Whenever you perceive that. You first perceive. That being loved into existence by the source. Whether you perceive it by sight sound touch or whether you perceive it by thinking about it. I mentioned the protein autonomy to literature. Magistri there's the wisdom function and then there's the wisdom writings. So, in the temples. At least in the temple where I lived in Japan at Koyasan, there was a custom. They celebrate New Years, a little differently than here, So what you do is you stay up all night like here on New Year's Eve. But you read the the entire 20,000 verses of approaching a paramita or at least as much of it as you can get through. Oh. Uh you chanted in sino Japanese. So I think I mentioned that it's. It's like an Encyclopedia Britannica. It's just got all this detail of information about the world. India, 2000 years ago, approximately translated into Chinese so it just. List all this stuff and then it says this is outdated that's empty it's got all the. You know all the cultural information. Crazy ideas, they had about geography and you know, etc, etc. And then it says this is empty. This is empty this is empty. And you might wonder well what's the point. But. When we won, I won New Years when we were doing that, we were chanting all night. And you have to look at the book right 'cause there. We can memorize so much so you actually reading it so you're seeing what the text says. Uh. And I realize that. What what this was all about? Why we were doing that? 'Cause well, let's see do you know the? Did you ever hear Allen Ginsberg's parody of the project a pyramid on? Oh. I don't know if it was written down or if you just performed it. But it was something to the effect of. * is empty *** empty. Markesan can screw is empty something along those lines, yeah, really probably find it on the Internet so. Well, I just said a bunch of 4 letter words, but it when you. If I say you know houses are empty apartments are empty parks are empty. If you really watching image space. You will see that you get what incense for this call spoke to spo. TSSPHOTS program spoke up what a sapota is is a little flicker of an image. That's very, very fleeting. So when you're reading you know this is empty. This is empty everyone of those those, this is. I started to notice created am a momentary mental image how else would I know what it means right. And then I started to. Tune into that and I could see the images each one of those images born in between expansion and contraction. Coming from and returning to. Empty. So it's a whole meditation. You're thinking about the world? How do you think about the world do you actually are actually aware? But each one of those bursts of image and talk come from and return to the source. So once you sort of realize that. Oh. You will be able to understand the. The early 20th 21st century North American Sutra. Which goes like this? Trump is empty. Obama is empty trunk is empty. Obama, as empty as many times as you need to hear that.","title":"What is Love at the Deepest Level"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/what-is-the-self/","text":"Can you explain to me?

So you have mental experience that consists of visual and auditory thoughts and it's continuous. And you have body sensations, some of which are physical. Some of which are emotional and they're pretty continuous, too right. So you're constantly pulled to mental States and body states. And nothing mysterious so far, no anyone can see that you've probably also notice that when a thought arises you tend to say this is me, this thought is me right right and I bought your body experience. We even said. You're right these sensations. There me right, especially if their emotional right a brokenly is me. But a broken heart is in some ways, even more me an emotional sensation. So you've noticed how moment by moment. There's a lot of thoughts. But we can analyze them sensorially into something visual and something auditory and you've noticed how moment by moment you have physical sensations for sure, and sometimes emotional. It's incessant and you also notice that as soon as a body stay Dora Mindstate arises. You tend to say this is me these are my thoughts. This is my body, so to sum it up. You're going to get different answers, depending on who you ask and those answers are all legitimate. Of the different perspectives on the word self. But for me. The simplest way to think about self is self is a moment by moment experience. And that experience consists of mind and body and mind his mental image and mental talk. Body is physicality and emotionality. So, your mental images your mental talk your physical and emotional. Experience is what you identify with moment by moment and that is the ordinary experience of self.","title":"WHAT IS THE SELF"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/what-technique-does-shinzen-use/","text":"Out of curiosity, what strategy do you generally employ using your technique as I'm bumping around in the world you know not not on the cushion on the cushion, yeah, mostly. Both gone. Simultaneous expansion contraction and their vanishing. So float float well both at but both is the label for unawareness that there is simultaneous expansion and contraction. That's part of the that's part of So so the quick answers in terms of what's on the grid its expansion contraction flow. That's what I that's what I typically am aware of OK and then when I was reading the manual about that for us. It was 'cause I love flow and I and so forth, but I also saw that it was like don't forget to stay in see, hear and feel rest. The focused out and it focused him focus then just because there's subtle levels that you don't want to know that you're still needing to process understand so it's OK to have sort of a main practice. But if you're familiar with the whole grid. I encourage People at least occasionally to touch base with other things, just to get some balance. But that's just a light suggestion if you're not familiar with the whole grid. Obviously you can't do that. But let's say you're familiar with the whole thing I think it's. A lot of People have a single thing that they do that's their main practice. Oh, but if you are familiar with this other stuff. I think it's useful to touch base at least occasionally with it for round rounding purposes. But if you're not familiar with the whole bread, then you just can have just one practice. But remember that. One of the ways you push the envelope is by me if there's a particular proceed particular approach that you like you see well. Can you maintain it like in motion and then in daily life etc. So maybe you could get like a lot of flow when you're sitting but can you actually get it while you're talking to People and driving the car that's a wave like pushing the envelope with the practice.","title":"What technique does Shinzen use"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/where-does-love-come-in/","text":"Seriously, good. So tonight's her last night and there were several requests to talk about the iconic representation of human happiness. So I'm going to do that. First, though I want to respond to a question actually Asia gave really good question. And so I just want to briefly respond to that which is. On this path where does the love come from? I think that was the takeaway piece right? How yeah? Where does it fit it so I would say that? The actual word that's used. In a lot of the Buddhist world is this would be the. God. Got forgetting how to write Chinese use it or lose it. Good enough or right, yeah, yeah, this guys pretty sure this doesn't have that stuff right. So Bay in Mandarin Chinese G he in Japanese. This one means love it might 3 in Sanskrit Meta and Polly. This is corresponds to the lab and God or not compassion. And these are sort of linked concept so when you say where does the love come from within a sort of Buddhist way of thinking about things that's where does the my 3:00 carnal come from or how does it fit in? And so that got me thinking. And it seems to me that within the framework that I present to you procedures and the categories. There are it comes from 4 sources. One is it's just natural human beings are born with a natural sense of love. In fact because I'm getting sort of Chinese tonight, but there's a word in Chinese. That means according to Confucius. It carries this sense of natural log that everyone is born with pronounce run and it's a character for person, and the character for 2:00. So it's like the natural thing for People is to love each other. That's the way we're born, according to Confucius. So then what happens when what happens is that we accumulate a lot of poison and pain and our primordial. Sort of instinct to love gets covered over by many physical, emotional mental uncomfortable experiences in the process from infancy process of socialization process, discovering the physical world can hurt you the natural spontaneous love. Gets covered over so as we work through that store poison and pain as it percolates up in our practice and we essentially don't do anything about it. We just open up to it, and let it dissipate don't reinforce it. So that stored poison in pain gets worked through. And to the extent that. The suffering the seeds of suffering are being extirpated from US to that extent that primordial love just gets uncovered again. It's always been there. So that's one source of it. Another source actually related by the little different side to it is remember its compassion and love. So they GE so that the struggles that we go through. When we do this path, particularly in the beginning and. Gotta be honest, the beginnings about the 1st 20 years, particularly in the beginning, particularly in the beginning of the beginning, which is maybe the first five years. We are very, very typically. We humans who take on this path are very uncomfortable while we're doing the practice. We we do everything we can to show you how to have fun and so forth, but the 18 minutes in the body. There's the. Scattered Nahs in the mind, there's all sorts of emotions. Confusions sleepiness within the context of North American repulsing a practice of course, you can take a break. Anytime you want, but within the Asian sort of traditional training and whatever if you're in a monastery. There are no breaks its merciless and it can be pretty damn hellacious. During those initial years of training. So you might say Well, Gee. That's sort of like really bad, but the effect of that is to impart within a person. An unforgettable lesson in the nature of human misery. You I know you wonder like why do I have to face all this * when I sit here my personal * Well, part of it is that later on down the line. When to a certain extent that's gotten worked through. You will never forget how miserable you were at you realize that most human beings live in that kind of misery. And you will have a sense of compassion for them because of what you had to go through. So that's one of the uses you don't realize it at the time at the time it's just like. You know why does this have to be so hard and why am I so miserable etc etc. But then you look back at you realize Oh I was. I was learning a lesson. That's going to stay with me for my entire life. I really know what it means to be miserable. I can tell you in the monastery in Japan. I definitely knew what it meant to be miserable 24/7 and it was relative to Japanese standards by no means the most rigorous kind of environment. Now the most rigorous training environment in Japan is mill, Shinji Zen Temple. It's called only Sodo. Only then soda and Zachary mean the same thing. Only then only in Japanese means demon demon demon meditation. All the expression is for the first three years. The novice never shows the white of their teeth, meaning they never smile. Once in the first three years of the training is just abject misery. Crucially, Lorenzo Co in Japanese, it means like unending sequence of Miseries. Uh. But. As the result of that it produces People like society well, she my teacher, Sasaki Roshi. That's where he trained 10 years at least I'm thinking at Mill Shinji. And now 104. The activity of compassion does not stop. There's no retiring. There's no vacations. It's although it's like all service all the time. To anyone who wants to do the practice. Where does that kind of vitality come from? Where does that endless patients come from from those horrific early years where you know you will never forget the misery of the average human being, however, transcended he becomes and he'll care so there's compassion and it's love, so one thing is well as you work through your poison and pain. The natural love is just there another is that? In the process of working through your own poison to pin you have to face your poison in pain. And that gives you this sense of compassion for the human condition, that's the gold standard of spirituality is love of the human condition. Uh. It's beyond love of humanity. I mean could love humanity. But you have to love the human condition, which is really screwed up. So that's another source. Then there's merging there's I've now there's the experience of other as yourself and that comes in 2. Flavors relative and absolute most of you are familiar with the focus out technique where you anchor yourself in the physical senses sites and so forth that causes a relative merging of inside and outside so you experience other as yourself. Quite literally not as a concept, but as actual sensory event because it's all about expansion and contraction. And so, if the touch sight sound of another expands and you allow the image Doc and emotional body of your subjective world to contract. Then you experience other as self. And if you have many, many, many experiences like that, well that leads to an I thou relationship with other. As opposed to an eye, it or were still an US versus them relationship. So that merging that comes about by focusing out that's a relative wannous and so that with which you are one. You naturally feel some love for then there's the absolute merging which is to share 0. Not only does the subject disappear, the object disappears and you and the other abide in the source. The dimensionless point before The Big Bang of each moment of self and world. Each mind moment is a sort of little version of The Big Bang, a little Big Bang. Like little big man or something so we have these little big bags and before each little Big Bang quote before. There is What the one the singular the singularity the zero and so having those absolute mergings experiences with People you come to a sense that we all sort of our have our feet placed whether we know it or not. We're all have our feet placed the same groundless ground. And so that gives you another reason for viewing others as brother and sisters share the room with Formless Moon. That's what brother and sister in Greek Adelphos. It means our Delphos arming Charan Delfos is move. So that which which you share the world, the formless wood, the same source. Naturally, there's a sense of. Love and conserved so those are I could think of within the theoretical and practice framework that I give you that would be 4 places where love comes from comes in. So.","title":"WHERE DOES LOVE COME IN"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/why-meditate/","text":"Meditation optimizes 5 fundamental dimensions of human happiness. The first dimension is reducing suffering.

It's actually helpful to understand yourself at a psychological level, but where meditation really shines is to understand who you are at the deepest level.

There can be a bit of an overwhelm 'cause. They're not prepared for the technical nature of them? What would you say to People to help them get through that initial? Overwhelmed so that they stick around to get there. Ultimate. Simplicity and good stuff, it leads to. I would say. Uh. Don't try to understand it get used to it. There is a Japanese proverb Natale Jordan Ariel. Which literally means that it's not a matter of learning it? It's a matter of getting accustomed to it? Someone once asked a very prominent. 20th century mathematician John for Neumann. About his mathematics that he had used during a lecture. They said professor from Neumann. I can't understand. Your math and he said. Math is not something you understand math is something you get used to. And when I heard that it's was hugely helpful for me. Um. You listen and you think and you practice and you read and you listen and you think any practice and you read any listen and you think in your practice and read. Over and over and over again and with time it sinks in. There is a reason why I formulated that copious and precise vocabulary. In the long run, it's going to hopefully allow People to work smarter. Because the old fashioned way. Where you have to just sort of discover it on your own and often it's a brute force method. You just have to put yourself through such horrific ordeals that at some point you're just forced. To experience certain States and forced to certain things well. The average modern person is not going to intentionally put themselves through that kind of thing. So my idea was. OK, instead of the brute force methods if we can make the formulation crystal clear. Yes, up front, it takes a little bit of work because it's like we're being sent back to school. It's like. Watt, I have to like learn vocabulary. I have to learn definitions. I have to make subtle distinctions with regards to things that seem irrelevant or that I haven't experienced so I do understand that People have that resistance at the beginning, there's always. Strong points and weak points in every way of working the weak point in the way that I work. One of them is that up front your *** to really carefully think about the nature of sensory experience to have a classificatory system for sensory experience. It also for the things that lead beyond sensory experience and it's described in a vocabulary. That is something like the rigor and precision that we would find in mathematics, so it's like wow that you're right? That's a major stumbling block for People because they don't expect to have to. Alarm work that way I think you're coming to a retreat. You know it's going to be Zen, poetry and finger pointing to the easy moons and suddenly it's like calculus? What am I doing here. However, my idea is that for that relatively small investment up front. In the end, it will allow them to work smarter and be able to achieve the classic goals. I don't necessarily say faster, but with less. Necessity for Horiffic Intensities 'cause when you hear about sort of traditional trainings that are done and you're tracking monastery monastic intensities, like whoa who wants to put themselves through that kind of thing, so my idea is by giving People this very precise vocabulary and having them maybe work, a little smarter. That, in the end, that will allow them to have comparable depth of experience, but still have their normal North American or modern. Let's say comfortable lifestyle. So yes, it's some investment up front, but I think number one if they realize. How much it's going to help down the line and #2 if they just take it gradually just gradually get used to it. That's what I would say with regards to take a break and easing up bearing down and easing up to balance so that if they've been working very hard, they can. Ease up and do something. That would be less intense well, I think you're asking with regards to learning the vocabulary is actually well. I I was actually talking about you know first coming in with all the five ways. And all the techniques and that potential overwhelmed. I remember before the five ways. When I first went to one of your retreats. I said, You know, I was in an on line with you and I said, You know this is like playing scales this is. This is you know this is technical work. I'm having to pay attention and really play scales and I stopped being a classical musician. 'cause I didn't want to practice my scales and you said it is like playing scales, but the music is your life. An I thought. Good answer you know that said that you're developing this skill. To use in your life well, I would say that. The reason I present people with. Several approaches is not that I necessarily want them to learn how to do all those approaches. I would like them to be exposed to a range of possibilities. So that they can find what works for them. Some People like the flexibility of having 5 contrasting ways of working. But some People like the will just choose one of those 5. And aside that's all I'm going to go for but at least they can see the the range of what is available and then so the idea is not that you have to learn this giant system? The idea is all you have to do is find 1. Good technique that works for you and then if you want to just stay with that fine. If you want to learn other things that's fine, too, so I think the combination of realizing that you only need one good technique, plus giving yourself time to get used to the vocabulary and take it slowly plus realizing that the complexity. The scrupulous precision will in the end payoff. Because you'll be able to work smarter get more bang for the Buck so to speak. I think keeping that in mind may help People, a little bit with the challenges of studying meditation with the Demented Physic Cesar. Somebody once called me amended physics, yes, I like that, you can use it.","title":"Working Smarter"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/working-with-shinzen-many-options/","text":"My name is Stephanie Nash and I am sitting here interviewing Shinzen Young, who is an innovative meditation teacher who's come up with his own. Mathematical and Scientifiques. Journey to 0 and we're going to be talking about a lot of things today. But before we do I want to make sure everyone knows how to get more of you? How to access video talks appears on the website. You have MP threes. You do retreats in person and you also do Phone based retweets. So let's just go through these and make sure we know which is which first for your personal retreats where if someone wants to come and do a residential retreat with you they would go to shinzen.org that's correct that's also a site with. More than books worth of free article content so that's sort of my personal side and Archives. Previous work that I've done so you go to sinsen.org and look under my schedule if you want to come to A. On site program with me or if you want to get like tons of articles and you can also order CDs. Yes, you have a whole CD. the CD store. There are there, but more modernly. I have an MP3 site and I think most People are more modern now where People would probably go there, although some People like the CDs. The MP three site is shinzentalks.com so you can download. Is quite a bit there. They really convenient and really cool site? Is basic mindfulness.org that's one stop shopping for practice, cool site? What's cool about it is all of the things that tend to get in the way of People doing this practice, which means it's hard to get instruction from. Somebody that you can relate to because they may not move in your area. You can't travel. You can't leave your family. You don't want to incur expenses. You don't want it to take a lot of time. There's a lot of speed bumps that get in the way of having a regular practice. Basic mindfulness.org is my attempt to get rid of those speed bumps for the world. It's one shop, stopping for. Practice meaning that we run classes and very, very short micro retreats that are telephone based now when I try to describe this to people. I always get this glazed over sort of quizzical look because they can't quite compute wait. It's in my home. It's a telephone? How does this all work kind of thing all I can say is? Just try it, you will see it's very intuitive you get cheap long distance, calling and if you don't know how to do that. We've got something on the site that tells you how to get it, dirt cheap. You get hands free operation, either with a headset or just a speaker Phone. You're not on the telephone all the time. But you are on for interaction with me and for group discussion an for group guided then you hang up. You work on your own and then you come back and you have more discussion. So all the features that would be present in a residential retreat that might extend for a week. We've economically packed into a 4 hour micro retreat situation and one thing I can say from having done this actually. Uh when we're on the Phone. Sometimes there's a greater intimacy, sometimes on a Phone. When we talked to People versus in person where you're dealing with that Enerji and having your voice coming in on the Phone also when I'm in my home it brings that. It brings the Association of the work into my home but it also feels quite personalized as opposed to being in a room with a lot of People. It's kind of like it does many paradoxes People thought it's going to destroy the sense of Group Enerji. Well, it doesn't destroy it. It creates a different group enerji, but there's still a group Enerji and I can't explain it, but there is so you got that. People said Oh well, it's in my home and in my home is where all my buttons are that I'm going to be distracted and self indulgent. I gotta go away to a center well what we discovered is counterintuitively if you do it, you can do it in your home and when you do it. Sacramental eyes is the home rather than polluting the retreat doing it in your home sacramental eyes is your home and then you see that you can do it in your home so there were many counter. Very nice counter intuitive results from this so basically the second weekend of every month, is home retreat practice weekend. We give 5 independent programs. At least 1 of which every month, is an intro program requiring no previous experience in anything like this whatsoever, meaning edit any given month anybody anywhere in the world. Can get started with the practice would be off and running with a technique and then next month they can come back. Maybe do that same technique or learn another technique and it's all there, but you just have to go to basicmindfulness.org read how to get started. Is it written material? Does written material that has like shin said.org? Is vast archival stuff but the the audios and the readings that basic mindfulness.org is pared down that's just what you need in order to get started with the practice.","title":"Working With Shinzen - Many Options"},{"location":"shinzenvideos/world-mysticism-with-a-capital-m/","text":"So I I will not spare you the sand script atop the old undershot yoga. That is the opening lines of the yoga sutras of potentially that mark alluded to. It's quite extraordinary. Sutra in the Buddhist sense. Sometimes generically just means scripture like Chap, the sutras and so forth Poly pronunciation is suit up. Although in a more specific sense sutra means the discourses of the historical put up to certain section with him. the Buddhist literature. However, within the broader context stuff index civilization. Sutra has a different meaning. It's a literary form and the point of this literary form is to condense a science into the. Shortest possible. Exposition in terms of numbers of syllables. So the yoga sutras describe what's called Ashtangi Tioga or the 8:00 limbs of yoga. Apron yoga, sometimes called Raja Yoga and you'll also notice that Buddhism is Aria I strongly Buddhism has an 8 fold path also. Now even the words at the same, the 8:00 elements are not the same but. Clearly there's influence going back and forth. Uh. But it says in Sanskrit is. Yoga is cheap to Brittany Rotor. It is the cessation of the fluctuations of consciousness. About the rest are attacked at then and only then. Does the true observer abide in its nature? It. Presents a practice that is very similar in many ways to Buddhism. On the other hand, it presents a conceptual framework that in some ways, is the diametric officer. Because it's what we call gone. Is Nero to that's cessation? But whereas in Buddhism, it's interpreted as no self. In. US Hindu context. It's a particularly in the yoga, sutra context. It's interpreted as the true self the true observer. If you are just involved in. Concepts. Like a scholar. Or a Devil teen. Then it's an endless argument. Who has the right formulations? But if you're involved in practice. You realize that there are many alternative ways to. Describe. What we the effects of the practice? And it is also true that sometimes identical vocabulary. Is it referring to the same thing at all? So to develop a kind of sensitivity? Where you know that you can detect when the same words refer to something different. And you can also detect where very different words may refer to very similar things that's. That takes a little bit of practice. I was there was a request to. In the notes for me to talk about Jewish Mysticism Tonight Apropos of Shabbat. Uh. And I I love to talk about that. But I thought I would frame it in a somewhat larger context and talk about world mysticism. So. And then come Jewish and other ones fitted and how what we do fits him. So. What comes to your mind? When you hear the English word mysticism. Something pop into your head. Oh no mysticism. What else happened so the same thing doesn't happen so regular People like something very special this is interesting? Other People what pops into your head and hear that contemplation. Say goodness. Now we were mentioning. The word mysticism. It's got it is am on it, OK that word specifically. Interesting OK. Did you say direct experience of truth? The whole collection of traditions spiritual traditions cool. Well let me tell you what? Pops into my head as soon as I hear that word. All pops into my head is. Ambiguity it is. Dangerous to talk about mysticism. As simply a word. Without realizing that it is used in 2 very different. Census. And the two senses that it is used in is actually rather interesting. So. Um. In the sort of colloquial sense. It. Car notes. New AG. Realms of power kinds of unusual experiences. Visions psychic powers that that sort of thing. But as a technical term that would be used by scholars. Historians People who specialize in academic study of religion. It refers to something quite different. It refers to the contemplative Endeavour what we're doing here. So the first thing, one needs to be careful about if you're having a discussion with someone about quote mysticism. It is to be sure that you're talking about the same mysticism because. Uh. You could end up in. A lot of. Misunderstanding. So. What's the relationship between the 2:00 meanings of mysticism. Well, the way that I sort of look at it. You can think of the Mystical Path. As a journey from the surface of consciousness to the source of consciousness. And in making that journey. You some People encounter some weird unusual stuff. Um in the intermediate realms between surface and source. The Intermediate Realms are those of the realms of the archetypes. Those are the realms in which gods ghosts ancestors. Angels can actually be experienced. Sensorial perhaps vividly. So, in passing from surface to source in going through that intermediate material. Some People or in passing through that intermediate realm. Some People have weird experiences. That's mysticism with the I call it mysticism with a small amp. Not everyone who passes from surface to source encounters weird unusual stuff. But some People do. Now, when you touch the formless source. The salient defining characteristic of touching the formula sources that it profoundly changes your notion of who you are. It's like a paradigm shift. Uh. And. That's mysticism with capital M that's the way I describe it. So. As several People mentioned all around the world. We find actually both kinds of mystical experience. Oh, the mysticism with a capital M is of course, what we're mostly interested in here. Now. 4. Many People. Mystical experience in that sense comes about as the result of systematic practice. However, it is important to realize that sometimes People come to these experiences without any formal practice at all. It just happens. Couldn't maybe once or twice a year I get an email from someone who had done any meditation. Uh but just one day like one person put it one day I was just big or another one day. In all the world at myself became paper thin. And there, but not there. And and it's permanent. It just happens. Now that indicates to me that this is a natural phenomenon. 2. The other thing that indicates to me that it's a natural In other words, the fact that it just happens without cultivation to People. The other thing that indicates to me that it's a natural phenomenon is the relative universality of. Baba booey contemplative or mystical practice around the world. So if you take the yoga sutras for example, it divides into these 8. Uh steps. Yama Niyama Asana Pranayama Pratiharas Deanna Semantic. Um. The first couple steps are about religious customs and ethics sort of like getting your act together as a human being in terms of character. And that roughly Maps on to what in Buddhism is called Sheila. And that also Maps on to the first few stages of Saint Theresa's model. Which is in a book called last moradas the interior Castle? It starts with this sort of like working on your behavior working on your issues that kind of thing. All that in the in the yoga sutras yet proceeds through up and force. This is what makes the index system in some way superior to the western system. It talks about Ossama Proma, so that means working with the breath and postures. That the notion that posture has an impact on consciousness was not appreciated in western mysticism. The way it was in the E. OK, so then. I'm going to skip some details but. Then you go through a sequence of ever deepening concentration. And that's also what's in Teresa's interior Castle after you so they got their act together. Then she gives many benchmarks over many years decades of developing more and more concentration power. Now the yoga sutras describe the same thing. Um. And it's that corresponds roughly to the Buddhist Johnna System, the absorption system. So we can see that these Maps in general will have a component of working on your character. They have a component of building concentration power? Then they'll have a component. Of something else. But here's where things could get very confusing vocabulary Wise. Because in Buddhism. That something else is looked upon as a kind of transformation of consciousness, a new way of understanding who you are. And it's called crunch, yeah, so in Buddhism, it proceeds. Sheila some anti personnel. When you read Saint Teresa, her interior Castle proceeds exactly the same way. Work on yourself as a person then all these different stages of ever deepening absorption and then what's amazing is to read very late in life? She had this experience. Of. And you can see that she's struggling to convey. How different it is from everything she experienced before? And she refers to it as an intellectual vision, OK, but she says that that's not really what I'm talking about because it wasn't a vision. And it's not intellectual, but something shifted and the salient feature of that. Was that? Well, the way that she put it. The Self forgetting is so great. That, it seems as though the soul no longer exists. I mean, anyone with the Buddhist background immediately sees. Insight into know so and it's permanent. It's permanent. But along with the paradigm of nothingness. Comes also the paradigm of Oneness, there related. So she also describes this experience as she says the? The The Oneness with with God is like. The wonders of water in water. Now she's writing in the 16th century. She's actually writing for the Inquisition. You know that they would. Approve what she had to say 'cause, yet that like get everything passed right by the thought. Police Catholic Europe and it had no difficulty passing in fact, it became the standard model used by the Catholic Church. To this day. And when I first read this and I saw my God, this like mats on. Quite so clearly to Buddhist experience. It totally blew my mind because this is 16th century Spain. This is a completely different world while I should this. Mount bond is something that someone wrote in 6 century, Shree Lanca. These worlds had no contact whatsoever. And yet they're describing roughly similar map so that's mysticism with a capital L. Um. What's good? What could be a little confusing is? That in the yoga sutras, they don't explicitly talk. About the wisdom function as being in some some way different from the concentration process. However, it's implied in there. The steps it the last three steps in yoga or call Donna Dianah Semantic. Um. So Donna means holding that's the stage in concentration where? Your attention Wanders and you have to bring it back your attention. Wanders and you have to bring it back. You've probably noticed that states that start on that. Johno. Your attention doesn't wander anymore. It the description in the yoga sutras is that it's like an unbroken stream of Sesame. E oil when you pour oil OK. If there's a continuity there. So, your whatever your object of focus is your attention stays there. Um. That's called job. That is the word that corresponds to Poly Word JAMA and clearly there's a relationship, although they don't. It's not exact one for one correspondence, but they're pointing to similar general directions. Then there's the final stage in the yoga path Roger Dover Path. Is called Samadi OK so remember I said? The trick is to know when the same word refers to different things have been different words refer to the same thing OK could be very tricky to have the sensitivity to be able to. Smell what's going on? So. I've I've seen endless arguments between yoga People and Buddhists. About somebody. So my knees where it's at so he's not where it's at somebody is where it's at somebody's not working. Not realizing that they're not really talking about. Quite the quite the same thing it's confusing because it's the same syllables. And it's closely related. But not exactly the same it within the Buddhist context. While I showed you the 3 steps in Buddhism, she loved somebody progeria. That's called the traineeship shining the threefold training. It's away another way of organizing the Eightfold Path. Um. So within this context and in general within Buddhism. As a general principle, Samadi is a generic TER. Anything from a light. Focus to a concentrated state so profound that you don't need to move for days. Add your Physiology is so altered that. He might be mistaken for dead. OK anything along that whole continuum in Buddhism is called somebody. But in the yoga sutras only the deepest part is referred to that some anti. And there's actually 2 kinds of somebody distinguished in the older system. There is Somebody just somebody and nearly just somebody. Somebody with a seed and somebody with policy. So what is the seed a seed is a sensory object that you're focusing on? So let's say for example, that you were focusing on. Music you wanted to make music your path to enlightenment. So. Your. You start listening to music, I went through a period of about 3 years where I was like really bored with meditation and the only way I can get myself interested was by listening to classical music. But at least it's sort of kept me going you know, so you're listening to the music and your attention. Wanders and you bring it back your attention wanted you. Bring up that at some point your attention doesn't wander so much anymore. Then, at some point, so that you know bring it back that starner. It doesn't wander anymore. It just stays there. That's down not in the Yoda sense of the word job. But then you can have this experience, where there's just the music. And no sense of and I listening to the music. You become the music. Um. That's somebody just somebody well. How does that come about from the paradigm that? We've been using here it's simple. There's only so much real estate in consciousness. If 100% of the awareness is going into the music that leaves zero awareness to go back to see in here in Feelin. OK, so. The. So it's identical to Sasaki Roshi's. To the first part of Sasaki Roshi's Co op? How do you become free from yourself when you see the flow? Well, he wants you to have a visual experience of just site. And no reactive self. So that's something just Ahmadi. Um. It's essentially well. Yeah. That's what but there's there's beach. Uh there's there is a sensory event there. There's just. All of the all of the attention. Is allocated to that sensory event and back? Where there would have been a self? Where there would have been seeing here in feeling there. There isn't that there's just the sea out where the hero. But you still seeing a flower you're still hearing the music sound. Um. A deeper experience. Is near be just semantic? Some anti without are seed. That's formless amounting. Well. What in the world is that? That is Samadi I'm gone. That is cheaper, it in errata that is the cessation of the fluctuations of consciousness. You. Have such a complete experience of the sea out of the flower or they hear out of the music that there's no fixating of the site or the sound into a thing. And so. There's just the Godness. Of. The cider sound. And there's just the godness of the self and they are the same baldness. Um. As I say in. In the yoga sutras that is described in terms of semantic. Whereas in Buddhism, it would be described in terms of insight into no self and emptiness. So that's the source of the argument between Buddhist at the yoga, yoga practitioners. It's an inability to realize that. Sometimes the same word is used in different ways. And sometimes different words are used to point to essentially similar things so if you attain. Near be just somebody you have also obtained. BAE call an abiding. Contact with gone. Well, not exactly in a biting contact you can't have binding contact. You can only. Have a self that returns. And looks back and knows that an instant before it was one with everything it was 1. In uh nothing. Experience but that's the re occuring of a self enlightenment is actually a kind of self. I know that's like hugely confusing. When I first heard Sasaki well, she say that enlightenment is a kind of stuff. It's like Oh wait a minute. That's totally contrary to what Buddhism says in like? What is no self right well. Enlightenment is is an experience of no self, but in the moment of experiencing gone. Or near be just some ality. In the moment of experiencing that there's no experience are so there's actually no conscious awareness of it. But a second later. Uh a self returns. And it has seeing here in Phelim that represent. The no self experience that it just had and as the years and decades proceed. That returning of the self. Um as an enlightened self. It becomes clearer and clearer and clearer it has a clearer mental image. It has clearer way of being able to describe and it has clearer emotions. Around the experience of no self that it just had. So. In the yoga tradition, the goal is to attain Sajas Ahmadi. That's at least according to some of the books. What is saja. Meanwhile, sajer means on the natu natural so in this case it means in daily life, it means as you're bopping around in the world. Thousands of times a day. You have an experience of. The one that is the nothing the completeness that is. The sensation. And then you have a clear experience of coming from that. And. Ah. And you know where you just came from. And you know exactly what your job is. Ah, how how to get back. How you get back is by not trying to get back but by completely affirming saying yes to the re arising of the personal self. So. This is equivalent to. In our system. The. Working with gone M and seeing how. I come from in return to that moment by moment. But it's not formulated as I say in terms of a wisdom or an insight quite as quite specifically so it can be confusing was very confusing to me 'cause I thought well. The yoga system just culminates in in high concentration, it doesn't culminate in enlightenment. So it's inferior to the Buddhist Formulation, but then later on, I realized that that was just an artifact of the language and the way things are described. So. Um all around the world. There is both mystical experience with the small M, the new AG sort of Mystical SH. Mystical rubble power stuff and then there is mystical experience with the big camp. So. But the different traditions might the components as far as I can see are all the same components are always there, but they may be language differently or there may be a different emphasis that obscures the fundamental similarity. Oh. In the Christian Mystical tradition. Oh, and I should say well, what are the components? What are the universal components? Well, I just gave you 1 formulation? Which is she let semantic prochnow so you work on yourself and you develop high concentration and then you have something that in Buddhism is described as going beyond concentration and also Saint Teresa of Avila described it that way it's going. Beyond concentration states it's a change in your your paradigm about. What you are what you're made of literally? But in the the yoga system. It's just called new beaches, Samadi and you might not realize you might think Oh that's just. More concentration, but if you attain cheetah Virginia Rhoda, the cessation of the fluctuations of consciousness. Whether you talk about it in those terms or not your paradigm your model for what self is will change and there will be a wisdom component. There so one way to look at at what's universal? Is there's work, you do? On yourselves for years, so there's there's sort of like work you do too. Improve yourself. Then there is always a description of the sequence of stages of concentration and then there is. Well, in Buddhism is described as that which goes beyond concentration where you gain an insight, which in Buddhism is called emptiness or no self. So. Within the Christian way of working. Um. The generic term for the states of high concentration is recollection, meaning not to remember but to collect back OK rain means back com means together and leg are a means to pick up or together. So Recollect Dio in Ordinary, English, it means to remember but as a technical term in Christian contemplative. Usage recollection means what we in Buddhism called Samonte. But if that recollection is. Up is very deep, it's called infused contemplation and that pretty much corresponds to Tiana. That kind of thing, so very deep experience. Now, one of the things that's a little bit confusing. Is that? There is A link between concentration, which is simply the ability to. Hold the focus there's a link between concentration and calming and tranquility, and indeed in the Buddhist system. There is a term shamatha in Sanskrit or psamathe in Poly that has both of those connotations. It mean it literally shum is means to tranquilize. Uh and Top means to fix it OK, so it's trying it as a single word that connotes both the tranquilizing aspect. And the concentration aspect that's why in Tibetan Shamatha was translated as she name. She means tranquil near means abiding OK, meaning you're able to hold the focus where you want. However, strictly speaking, but calming aspect and the concentrating aspect, although there are obviously very related they are not identical things. Um. But you need calming is common OK but you need some com in order to be able to hold the focus Conversely if you're going to hold the focus things tend to mellow out a little bit. But in my way of thinking they're not identical. That's why all the techniques that I teach you have concentration, but the focus on rest technique emphasizes the calming or tranquilizing aspect. So. Within the Christian way of working the tranquilizing aspect is very much emphasized and so another term that's used is prayer of quiet. Or at your quiz. Um. So. The emphasis is on getting into these deep tranquil, States and the paradigm for what happens in those deep triangle states is the sole unites with God. And that is certainly a legitimate paradigm that's a way to think about it. On. Within the Islamic mystical way of working we find the same elements. What's Islamic mysticism called? Sufism. So we find the same elements. Um. The paradigm for what happens. Is also similar? What is supposed to happen is something called phenac? FANA. And what that means in Arabic is. Nero to it means it means annihilation. So the sense of personal self. Uh. Is seen through Anaya lated an one experiences phenom phila? Which means disappearance of the something this of self that allows you to melt into other into God. So let me see. Something roughly similar to the Christian paradigm sort of like. Merging with God concept. What about Jewish mysticism well Jewish mysticism has 2 paradigms? One is something called Devette Coot. Or in the Ashkenazic Pronunciation Vegas. You know that there's 2 there's 2 pronunciations of Hebrew. I was right on the transition my. First Hebrew classes when I was a kid, we learned the Eastern European pronunciation, then, when Israel achieve statehood. Um. And decided to go with the Safar * so that they they shifted if my synagogue and I'd like thriller. The whole thing again and suck that bad but it really didn't. It didn't sound like he poop, but anyway, so divine quote is the proper Safar. * Israeli pronunciation. And that could is I guess it would be written in English DEVE. KUT. That's the one most paradigm OK, so that is there. And it's talked about and the idea is that you can achieve their coot with anything OK. If you fully focus on anything that you're doing, you can have this sense of this, it becomes a merging experience. But there's another paradigm that's used in Jewish mysticism that I personally find extremely interesting. Because. It's you don't see anything like it in. Christian mysticism, you don't see anything like it in Islamic mysticism. This second parent Lee. But where you do, find this second paradigm. Is? In Sasaki Roshi's formulation of Buddhism. So. Years ago, I am I was in Montreal. We were having a Sachin's then retreat at this, then center that. Is like half of Leonard Cohen's house? He was born in Montreal in so he gave half of his house that he owns there to make a Zen Center and then he kept the other half. To leave him so he and I were staying in the half, where he lives and so I like woke up one morning and. He was like studying looking at the town would OK. And so I started said you know what? What are you doing and he said well? These Thomas that's like you know the Jewish sort of. I'll be darn I guess you could send him to mix metaphors, he said. These guys. We're trying to get to what no sheet is teaching or something to that effect. So. There is this paradigm of. Uh. Bryza Yesh MetLife. That as I say among the western forms of mysticism. As far as I know only Judaism has this one. So Judaism has the merging with God that could thing that as I say is so characteristic of the other Abrahamic religions Christianity Islam, But. Judaism as this other thing and this other thing is actually the main paradigm. What does briand aschman iron mean well Bree are means creation? Yesh means existence. Or something. Or self as all of those connotations. And mappings from. And I and means divine nothingness. So how is it that? The infinite sum things. Of self and world. Arise from the one. Very special nothing. That is God. To understand clearly that process. Is the central goal of Jewish mysticism? I remember years ago, having here in La having lunch with hot bod rabbi which is a form of quote Ultra Orthodox. Um and I said sum it up for me. What's your trip about I don't think I use the word trip It was something like OK, you lay it on Main. What's what's the? What's the final goal here? Is he said. Well, the final goal is in ordinary life. Up to be able to in each moment of experience. Uh. Experience how that moment is coming from and returning to. God and one. One way that that's formulated is what I just said Pre Aisha Iron. Another way that it's formulated is in the phrase Shifty Ha Shem Lanik D tommyd? This is really, really interesting. Phrase in Hebrew. I spent actually literally an entire morning in Israel with one of the Top biblical scholars. I mean, secular type. Scholars objective scholars on on the Hebrew language. Discussing she just like filled in all of these. Rich connotations of the phrase that I just said in Hebrew, So what it means is. Literally. 2. You can't even translate it into English, but it means to. Uh. To always equate. What is in front of you? With God, So what does it mean to equate? Well, there's a superficial way that that's done in Jewish mysticism. And then there's a deep way that that stop. The superficial way is that you use the associations of the Hebrew language. To constantly have things remind you conceptually of God. So that's a sort of intellectual way of trying to be thinking about God all the time. But from that's just the beginning of continuous contact, though the deeper experience is not sort of using all of these associations. It's not this intellectual endeavor, it's a perceptual endeavor. So the deeper, meaning of shifty ha. Shem Lennick Detombe need to have God in front of your eyes. All the time is to like literally have God in front of your eyes, so that means that you're experiencing what's quote in front of your eyes and In other words? What's in your senses what you see here and contact for your body you're experiencing the inner part of that itself and the outer part the world your. Experiencing that coming from and returning to the source moment by moment. In order to be able to have that experience how is that achieved? Well, you have to be willing to go through a process called Betul High Ish. Which in Hebrew means the annihilation of the something this within you sound familiar? Um. Then you're gifted. Um or put in our terms. You. Have to see. The Golan of self and world. Many many, many, many, many times. Before, you start to. Have a clearer perception of how that gone. Manifest. How that nothing manifests all the one nothing manifests the myriad somethings? Of self and world. So. How? Does that occur? Well, according to the Jewish Formulation in Coppola. It occurs through the the IT, meaning the manifestation of self and world. It occurs through an interplay of two forces why am I not surprised. Hazard and glue ha has it is affirmation. Expansion. Hula is negation contraction. And Uhm. In between. These 2 there is something called Simpson they pull apart. And they create a cleft. And in that cleft. Self and world arise moment by moment so this should sound rather similar. It is utterly extraordinary to me. That Sasaki Roshi's paradigm map song. This closely with the kabbalistic POV because, although he's well studied within the Buddhist tradition. I'm I I know I I am sure he has no knowledge of the Jewish meditative tradition and certainly the Jewish meditative tradition. That was formulated centuries and centuries ago in Europe and the Middle East never heard of Sasaki Roshi. So it's like it blows my mind, how similar it is. With so. Within the Buddhist tradition if you've ever studied them you probably learned the heart sutra OK. This is a famous. Sutra out there in the sense of scripture that chanted. And the lines go Congees Ibella Saga Logian on ya. Haha mythology show can cone. Kaiku Dory Cycle, Yahoo Charlie. She she carefully cuckoo. Felicia OK OK. So when the body suffer of a low key taste far I was practicing Prochnow para meter. He slash she clearly saw that all the. That the 5:00 aggregates are empty and that that was the secret for passing beyond all suffering and then have a little taste for it begins to speak to Sharon Poutre. So who is Shariputra Shariputra was the historical Buddha's chief disciple. And Shariputra is associated with the uh be Dharma and the Abbey Dharma is this formulation in Buddhism that classifies. The world and sensory experience. With the point of view of. That you can if you sort of untangle these elements. You'll be able to become free so that's actually very true but the problem is that at some point. People started to just read the Abbey Dharma and not practice meditation and they they equated learning these lists of categories with enlightenment. So then Mahama arose by way of reaction. An and said Hey just learning these lists of elements isn't going to enlighten you. You have to have a correct experience of should get of emptiness. So all the look he takes for representing the Miana POV. Speaks to shariputra representing the sort of Scholastic Hinayana POV, an what does valocchi taste far is saying he says. Shiki Phooey Cuckoo Phooey shaking. Form. Is? Uh form is emptiness emptiness is form. Now. The Zen People. Riff on that line big time because. Of the way it's phrased form is emptiness emptiness is form. When does M teacher gives a tracial on that portion of the scripture inevitably. They will say that. This. Summarizes. The entire path. And that the phrase form is emptiness, she keep who EKU and the phrase Koo Huy Shiki. Emptiness is not different from 4:00 that these are 2 sides to the practice. Form is emptiness is Betul High Ish. It's the experience of the annihilation of something nahs. In terms of our system it's flowing go. OK, it's dissolving back into Floanne Nirodha cessation. Form is emptiness, but then that's only half of enlightenment. The other half is to understand. In specific. How emptiness manifest form? Form is emptiness emptiness is form. So how does emptiness manifest form? Well originally there is 0. But 0 is inherently unstable. Because there is no actual 0. 0 is just what comes about when all the Yeses and all the nose needed to create this or any conceivable universe all balance and cancel. That's why the nothingness of the Mystic is a rich nothingness because it contains. Infinite positive and negative in a cancelled out condition. So originally there is nothing but nothing but there actually isn't a nothing. There's just the canceling of affirmation and negation. So nothing is inherently unstable and it breaks apart. And part of it only knows to affirm and that expense and the other part only knows to the gate and that contracts. And that creates a cleft which is the time space volume for each moment of sensory experience. This is how society or she describes. The passage from emptiness 24. And it happens to be as far as I can see the way that the Jewish Mystics describe it. and I haven't seen this description anywhere else in the world. That blows my mind, said well this is really cool. So. Been up been off. Means to know in the sense of separating things. To make discriminates discriminative noise. Dodd is to know in the biblical sense to know in a penetrating park. Like you know by it's like carnal knowledge EU. You have soaked into the thing that's the Top and a hallmark is the wisdom. That is a spiritual paradigm shift its enlightenment. That's exactly the 3:00 meanings in the word vipasa MA. We personal means to separate out the strands vipasana to see separate but Vipasana also means vipasana to see through or into. So I teach you how to separate the strands of experience and then how to let your awareness soak into them so that you can see that they're just made out of vibrating space. Expansion contraction bolds, the moment by moment and if you see that clearly enough you have. V Pasola in the sense of insight. Or wisdom. So, in Poly Vipasana in Sanskrit Depressional. It's one word with three connotations. In the Hebrew language. They actually have 3 words for each these each of these kinds of not one for each of these kinds of knowing but they yes combine it into a single acronym. At least with this particular group of Ultra Orthodox Jews. It's come up that's what they're about so once again the the. Parallels rather striking. So. When I have lunch and I said, OK, what is it? What is it? You know what's your thing about you, said well reallocation that I am. Through beetle high edge to to annihilate the something Ness of self, which will then allow you to experience. A special nothingness. So that's the part of the path that is form is emptiness and the Orthodox way of praying. Where you its body player, you move OK the idea is that you're trying to become like a flame without any fixation whatsoever. And hopefully at some point in that process. God will blow out the flame. Which is exactly Nirvana now isn't that exactly what that means the fling it's worn out so the actual that Orthodox Jewish body prayer that I love so much better than mine prayer. Is that's the whole goal here actually trying to be like move like a flame and become so flowing that at some point, it will get blown out and you'll experience between my age, so that's The part of the path, which in terms of our system is. Sort of related to the gods right. Then so but in Zen Formulation that she keep phooey coup that's form is empties. Then when that becomes clear then you can see the other side of the picture. How it is that that gone? Breaks apart. And vibrates self and world into existence and you know where you just came from. Now that person that knows where it just came from and knows where the world just came from Sensorially That's called an enlightened person. Um. So that the goal, according to this rabbi was you. Heroically. Throw caution to the wind. And let the source and I'll link to something is within you. AB tool high edge as the result of that you'll be gifted in daily life. With. Bree I ishma iron. And as the result of living your life that way. You optimally contribute to something called Tick **** Obama. The mending of the world.","title":"World Mysticism (with a capital 'M')"}]}
