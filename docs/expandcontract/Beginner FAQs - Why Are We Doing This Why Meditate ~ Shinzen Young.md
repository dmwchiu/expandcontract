Certainly one of the most frequent questions from beginner students.

Is?

Why meditate? What's the whole point of it? Why are we doing this kind of thing and I've given actually a fairly elaborate classification of the reasons to Meditate in terms of.

The notion of total human happiness that we meditate.

For our own personal unconditional happiness as well As for our personal happiness.

And we also meditate so that we can best contribute to the conditional and unconditional happiness of others so that's sort of the model that I give.

So yeah from beginners the question would be well. You know why should I even bother doing this.

And essentially the answer of.

Because well with this.

This particular case is mindfulness practice a certain form of meditation.

And this form of meditation elevates your concentration clarity and equanimity and if you elevate your baseline of concentration clarity and equanimity. Then you'll elevate your baseline of human happiness in the broadest and deepest sense or sense is that a human being can be happy, so in all the different ways that a human being can be happy.

Including the deepest possible ways a human being can be happy for all of the above we do this practice.

You might say that.

At the center piece is sensory happiness, independent of conditions and sensory happiness, independent of conditions comes about when you're able to have complete sensory experience.

Of your body and your mind.

And you have complete sensory experience of your body in mind when you when you cross a certain threshold of intensity of concentration clarity and equanimity applied to body sensations, and the thinking process, then your experience of ordinary body mind becomes utterly extraordinary, and your relationship to your body and mind change.

From your body and mind being a prison to your body and mind being a home where you abide but can leave anytime you want.
