Oh, I think it would definitely heal the world.

If we take if by that we mean stream entry.

And we mean millions and millions of People having that experience.

I don't have a scintilla doubt.

Well, you have to look at the big picture OK.



You have to look at.



All the People that were ever enlightened.

As they are have been in the world.

And then you have to compare that to as they would have been if they haven't been in light and you have to take all the P.

Because most enlightened People are not public figures.

And there may be indeed a certain push.

To the ones that do become public figures that also is related to.

Whatever.

So.

I didn't say it would heal the world right away either.

I just because remember I use classical enlightenment is a rough.

Rough equivalent to stream entry.

So.

That's the first out of 4 steps.

OK.

And usually about 20 years after stream entry you realize how unenlightened you really are.

And that the work is now just starting.

But you're guaranteed success essentially so.



You know after a few 100 years of millions and millions of stream enterers. I think that the course of this planet would pretty much be take care of itself.

Now of course.

I mean, if you want to.

Think really ambitious maybe.

If we had a really deep model of enlightenment, we'd be able to figure out how to churn out our hearts.

With consistency.

That's only maybe 5 times as ambitious is turning out stream enterers? Who knows now. If you turn out if you start having millions and millions of our hearts on the planet.

You know it's very quick, but if you.



So.

Yeah, plenty of People that have seen the no self screw up but.

Then there.

You have to look up on it from the big picture.

How badly would they have screwed up if they hadn't done that.

Well, I can think of maybe that I know personally.

Of.

Maybe a dozen People that have seen the no self were authentically enlightened at least to the stream entry level and had major public screwups. Let's maybe a dozen OK.

But there's probably.

100 times that many enlightened People on the planet so that's 1%.

That we know about.

And even those groups are.

You know, I mean?

I can.

I can only think of a couple that I would say are like really horrible.

Relative to the normal human screwups right.

I mean when the teachers screw up if you notice by and large is just normal. Humans grew up so I mean that People have sexual harrassment bosses sort of like things People do right.

I can only offhand.

Right now.

Maybe think of one or 2 that I would say where like really bad you know.
