What is interesting about zero and one?

Is that?

They are two of the main paradigms that have been used historically to describe the mystical path. The contemplative path. The path to enlightenment. In some traditions. It's described in terms of a oneness experience. That's very common around the planet and in some traditions. It's described in terms of a kind of 0 or emptiness the.

Word in Sanskrit.

For the number 0.

Is shonia or shunyata? Which is also the word in Buddhism? Which for the emptiness emptiness as the source emptiness as the nature of sensory experience, so the same words are used the very same. Sanskrit word the bigger an experience is for us.

The more overwhelming and experience is for us.

Is just a measure of how large the polarization the splitting of the zero of the source?

How far it has split? How much time space volume and how much sensory intensity has been born in between that polarization and if we can have a complete experience of such a large polarization the zero that comes.

When there is a reuniting which inevitably happens for us will be a deeper purification a deeper enlightenment. Then, for a small challenge you might say.

The one could be looked upon as.

One is any size you want is one.

Uh.

Alternatively, you could say that one is.

The combined effect of all canceling stretches and squeezes OK multiply by 3:00 and divided by 3:00. That's one. One kind of polarization. Few multiply by 1000 / 1000. That's another kind of expensive contractive stretch squeeze polarization so they play analogous rolls if we think of nature as being capable of.

Creating distinction.

And and

Wiping away distinction if that's in some way of fundamental activity of nature.

Then that would be reflected in our consciousness. Certainly.

If we are able to fully give ourselves to the forces of division the forces that.

Pull to the right pull to the left that stretch. It this way that squeeze this way. If we fully give ourselves to those forces. Then there's nothing to get in the way of the neutralization. The coming back and if you want to think of it as coming back to a Oneness. You can or if you want to think about as coming back to 0 neus you can also do it that way so.

Let's talk about the experience of Oneness in the sense in some of its guises we might speak of.

The.

Alienation of thought and feeling.

And.

We could then speak of the healing of that alienation.

And a unification.

Of thought and feeling thought arises through.

Either visual thinking auditory, thinking or both at the same time.

And emotionality arises through the limbic system in the brain, which causes.

Affect if so much thesia nice fancy way of saying body sensations that seem emotional.

If you pay attention to what happens when you experience anger fear sadness embarrassment impatience discussed interest joy. Love gratitude humor smile, etc, etc. These have flavors in the body there.

Initially, maybe nebulous, but eventually there just as distinct as hot or cold.

The Soma, the body can be trained into emotional high resolution screen.

There's no official word for body sensations that seem emotional in nature, so I call it Watt.

Feel just have a word, and notice. I say feel not feeling 'cause feeling has a gazillion connotation. So I sort of made an unusual noun using feel as a noun?

To point out that it's a technical term within this system so we have the body sensations that seem that are emotional in nature to us. We have mental images in internal talk now when you have a complete experience of feel image talk.

You are too busy experiencing it, too fixated. A complete experience is an experience where there is an extraordinary degree of concentration clarity and equanimity.

So to all coming together, we can't always have all three of these facts. Sometimes we can't have any of these.

You may have noticed.

We can't always have all 3.

When all 3 do come together at a certain critical mass than ordinary experience becomes utterly extraordinary, an my word for ordinary experience that has become utterly extraordinary is a complete experience. Now it's a technical term, though I don't need complete in the sense. It was intense. I don't mean complete in the sense that I don't know you stayed with it to the end. That's part of it.

By complete I mean that there was a certain critical mass of concentration clarity and equanimity present from beginning to end in that experience that constitutes what I technically call a complete or full experience.

We can't always have complete experiences, but sometimes we can and with practice. We can have it more and more and more. And when we have a complete experience of something that's ordinary it's utterly extraordinary because it's utterly paradoxical, I read the Saint John of the cross poem to you lie noche to give you a flavor of how something could be sensorially rich.

And yet also utterly transparent, and vacuous at the same time as a single experience.

So ordinary experience becomes extraordinary in that it becomes both.

Deeply fulfilling and no longer there.

And therefore ordinary experience becomes extraordinary because it's paradoxical I just said what.

Something that really doesn't make a whole lot of sense and I'm afraid many People would probably think is irrelevant to anything. Maybe they just think this is philosophical speculation or wordsmith 3.

I'm sorry I have no choice.

That's how you know when you start to have.

Complete experiences you end up having to say this stuff whether you want to or not.

One could also say that when you bring a certain critical mass of concentration clarity and equanimity to an ordinary experience. It becomes utterly extraordinary.

You could also say when you bring an extraordinary degree of concentration clarity and equanimity to an extraordinary experience like a God manifesting fully in front of you.

That experience becomes utterly ordinary.

That's the path of liberation as opposed to the path of power.
