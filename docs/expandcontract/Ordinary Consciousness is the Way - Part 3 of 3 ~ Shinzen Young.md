There was a Zen Master.



Sorry. You maybe you know who this was, I can't remember the origin of the.

The expression.



Ping chunxian sure.



Well, you might know that the cosmic way.

Sure means is shin you might know.

Means mind or consciousness or heart.

The ordinary consciousness is the way the cosmic way.

Well, what's the ordinary consciousness, the ordinary consciousness is?

Scattered in all directions and obsessing on one thing then scattered in all directions and obsessing on one thing then scattered in all directions. Or maybe scattered and obsessing at the same time, same instant, is that the cosmic way? Absolutely.

That's scattering.

That's just nature expanding that's expensive flow.

That thing that you call fixation that you make a problem that's just nature contracting contractive flow.

If you look at it that way you don't have a problem. It's just space dancing.

So, in the mind in the body.

Both in pleasant guises and unpleasant guises and if it presents itself, saliently you might want to make it a theme in your practice. In fact, it could present itself, so intensely that you sort of have no choice but to make it a thieve in your practice. 'cause there's hardly anything else that you can detect.

That's in the most extreme cases, an experience that's technically called panga. You can look it up on the Internet. BHA NGA when the flow and the vanishing become so intense that they just dominate your experience once again.

Plenty of People have become enlightened without ever having that experience just something to know can happen.

How 'bout external experience? How 'bout sounds well? Do they sort of vibrate? Do they sort of boom OK?

Is it easy to detect the vanishing of certain kinds of sounds?

You can listen if you choose the right kind of music with well defined phrase structures. You can listen to the Ganz to the unborn absolute silence whence. The music comes and whether it returns moment by moment just by choosing the right kind of music to do a music meditation with.

As well defined phrase structures that are at that data that you can hear those endings very clearly defined.

So.

Sounds space could be an exploration of impermanence.

Site is much more tricky to work with.

But if you defocus your eyes.

Things get sort of swirly OK and then you might say well. That's just an illusion, but then you're using that to develop a kind of equanimity with site and then when you start looking in the ordinary way. There's still sort of.

More fluid OK, one of the pay offs that comes from late night sitting and all night city will have another yasa late night sit on Thursdays are correct.

Is that right so you'll have an opportunity about 3:00 in the morning your eyes will start to swim OK and so will the external world and that can be an interesting venue to penetrate the something Nahs of the so-called material world in front of you insight space so although it's a bit more challenging. We can have the experiences of impermanence flow and vanish inside space.

In fact, if you look carefully each time your eyes shifts.

When it goes from one side to another.

The world that was.

Just falls away it's a little tricky you have to sort of look out of the corner of your eye as you shift, but it definitely goes chunk that's vanishing insight, space all of our senses.

Have a both in their ordinary active guys of touch sight sound feel image talk or in the special tranquil, restful sort of a meditative experiences of relaxation light silence peace blank quiet. In all of these experiences. There is the possibility for some hint of either flowing kind of change or abrupt banishing.

And if one wanted to pursue this as a theme one could why would one perhaps want to do that, well it can be very although sometimes it can be harsh.

Sometimes often and in the end, it is very soothing and you get the sense that the substance of your being is being worked on and Arogya are working within that is working out the poison and pain. It's kind of Purifica. Tori experience it's also a unifying experience because flow tends to flow.

And it cuts across the distinctions.

In this path there's a place for making empowering distinctions, distinguishing touch sight sound feel image talk. These these different dimensions of sensory experience.

There's also a place for those distinctions, disappearing and one of the ways that those distinctions disappear in empowering way is that the flow and vanishing unifies them.

And larger an larger pieces of sensory experience turn into a flow field an when external site an internal image external sound an internal talk.

Flow together, then the boundary between inside and outside disappears.

And that's a very natural way to come to an integration a unification.



And since the fundamental separation of inside and outside is more or less synonymous with fear.



Clearly, you understand why I choose the word empowering in speaking about the theme of impermanence.
