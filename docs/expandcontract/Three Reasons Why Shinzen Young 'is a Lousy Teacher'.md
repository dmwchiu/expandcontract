Here are the things that People tell me they don't like about the way I teach.

It's complex and subtle.

I give a lot of precise definitions of things and I have a lot of categories and relationships between categories. So some People find this tedious of course I would say by way of defense that I'm trying to create an all encompassing framework within which the world's contemplative Mystical traditions.

Can be understood Einstein said.

Alice's ulti, though I'm far removed comma. Where are banished in for her which means in good science everything should be as simple as possible, but no simpler meaning that sometimes a certain degree of complexity is simply unavoidable if you are looking for wide applicability, so but lot of People that are honest spiritual.

Have get impatient with going back into elementary school or middle school or high school and like memorizing definitions and terminology and so forth so I understand that that complexity and subtlety might be off putting to some People.

Some People say, I'm sort of cold and intellectual well, it's a personality trait. TS Eliot talked about the sharp compassion of the healers art. I think I'm in the sharp compassion side? Which.

He compared to a scalpel the Woon did Surgeon Plies. The steel that questions. The distempered part beneath the bleeding hands. We feel the sharp compassion of the Healers Art, so I think.

I might be a little bit on the cold and sharp form of compassion as opposed to the more warm and heartfelt side, but that's a personality.

Personality trait some People find my irreverence to be off Pudding. I am quite.

Comfortable criticizing my own roots in Buddhism, and sometimes I do that in pretty irreverent form that some People find off pudding and I can have a perhaps little bit over the Top sense of humor, sometimes about making fun of the Bush is tradition and some People say that's like that's too much.

So there's 3 reasons why People say, I'm a lousy teacher complicated. I'm cold and I'm irreverent.

But I think there's some good stuff, there to check it out for yourself.
