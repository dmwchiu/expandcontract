The experience of selflessness.

Comes about in several ways.

One is

When you're able to distinguish the sensory components.

That create that sense that there is a self inside me.

The model that I'd like to use of course, it's only one of many possible models.

The model I like to use.

Involves 3 sensory components.

Visual thinking.

Auditory thinking and emotional type body sensation. I call emotional type body sensation feel.

And the visual thinking image and the auditory thinking talk.

So when feel image talk get tangled together.

Then.

That's one of the factors that produces the sense of the conventional sense that there is a self here.

When you're able to untangle them then.

Something of the something iness of that self goes away a deeper level of the no self.

Comes about when after you've untangle them you realize that they're actually waves that they meaning the feel image talk. They aren't solidified things their waveforms.

That creates a fluid sense of self.

Which is?

Another level of approaching the no self.

There's the no self experience that comes through just purely disentangle ING. Then there's the no self experience that comes through D coagulate ING the elements that you've dis entangled.

Then there's the no self experience that comes about when those flows.

Stop.

And there is.

0.

And that's a kind of absolute no self experience.

And then

I would say that the Hyest Freedom.

Comes about when.

You can experience.

From that 0

The field image talk re arising.

And you totally allow it to re arise as an unblocked activity of personality.

Before when they arose they were a coagulate eed.

Something.

Called Self.

Or ego in the sense of ego problem as opposed to ego in the sense of Eagle Strength, which is a whole. Other meaning of ego, but when we say we have an ego problem that's self as coagulate eed now.

The deeper deeper freedom is when the self re arises.

But we experience it directly coming from the nothing.

And it re arises as an une coagulative verb.

Called a powerful and rich human personality.

Coming from the nothingness and never really fundamentally separate from the nothingness.

Returning to the nothingness.

In a cycle.

So I would call that a fully expressed self.

And I would say that that would represent a healthy experience of self.
