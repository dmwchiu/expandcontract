Hi my name is Kathleen and I've been meditating with shinzon for almost 10 years and I recently had.

A situation in my life that really.

Threw me off course.

My brother went into the hospital, he was taken to the emergency room.

And.

We were told that his body.

I began the dying process.

Now he is a very young man.

And for us to be told that it was really scary.

We were told that his liver had gone into liver failure.

And that if this body did not start to.

To to show any signs of healing in the next 12 to 24 hours.

He was going to go to the number one spot on the emergency liver transplant list.

And the entire SE part of the United States.

The shock does were like Oh my goodness yesterday, he was bebopping around the world.

And now he might die.

So our family stayed there. The entire day and into the night but then I said to the family. I said, please everyone. Go home get a good nights sleep. He was unconscious. I said get a good night sleep. I will stay here, and be with him tonight, just in case he wakes up.



They went home.

And what they didn't know is that I have this technique.

Of holding positive states for a lot of one.

And I am and I decided to do a yasa, which is where you stay up all night long and you. You focus for myself. I decided to focus on these positive states.

So I sat by his bedside and.

Because of the situation, I had.

A lot of feeling inside of me of love towards him so at first I said there and I radiated love towards him. I just sat there and I just.

Focused on the love going out to him. I'm looking at him laying in it bad.

I focused on the love going towards him.

After a period of time.

I wasn't I couldn't feel the love inside my body.

So then I started focusing on wonderful memories that we had had.

And.

I remembered great times. We had growing up an I would focus on that memory and then the love and the feeling which is radiate out of me towards him.

And I said there for hours and felt so much love and gratitude for him in my life and.

About two 3:00 o'clock in the morning.

The love kind of went away because of the exhaustion and I started to have talk of you know just Oh I'm tired. I want to sleep.

But then by focusing on that talk and then changing that, to love and so instead of going down the road of the negative talk I focused on positive talk.

An I would just sit there and I would just say love and I'd feel the love going out to him. I'd go love. I love you so much. I mean, I would just any loving thought or talk that I could say in my head to radiate towards my brother.

That's what I did.

You know, I I live my life that I try to love People day today. An I try to be there for them and I try to cherish them.

But I've never experienced a love that deep when I am in such a vulnerable state.

And he's in such a vulnerable state that.

To feel that love radiating towards him hour after hour?

It was a great it was a great gift that.

That, he gave to me that night.

For me.

By using the whole positive interstates.

It truly changed.

The way I feel about my brother. I have so much love and compassion in my heart for him.

And I feel like I love him on so much of a deeper level now and.

And I am just so grateful for for him and for the love and for the time that we that we have shared, he he he has had a full recovery and I am so grateful for that.

I know that without that technique. I would have gone to the hospital. I would have suffered I would have heard all the negative stuff that was happening. I would've heard he was going to die for this reason, or that reason or you know, I mean, I would have heard all of that negative stuff and I would have freaked out. I would have been I would have been in a panic state, I would have would not have been able to focus. I would not have been I would have been so consumed with all the negativity of the situation.

Then I then I just would have been in a huge ball of suffering.

Because of these this technique.

It turned a terrable negative situation in my life.

Into a deep clean of love for my brother.

I am forever, grateful for this technique.
