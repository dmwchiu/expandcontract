Impermanence is not just.

Eh.

Characteristic of sensory experience.

Impermanence is a kind of Energe.

That is.

A vital Energi that you can learn to ride up In other words, impermanence is cheap.

And so.

The idea in the Zen style of experiencing impermanence is yes, it's the same deconstructive thing I described.

But then you're also interested not just in form is emptiness.

But you're very interested in how emptiness becomes form moment by moment. Briand yashma iron to use the Hebrew Kabbalistic term? How there's a rising of something from nothing well. The nothing repolarize is into this kind of Energe and in then they want you to ride on that enerji not just to observe impermanence as an object, but to literally become impermanence and there is a kind of bouncy springy.

Vitality to the experience of emptiness as it is.

Encouraged in the Zen tradition and that was fostered by a certain.

Rhythm of practice.

If you've ever been to Zen retreats where you're never allowed to fixate in repulsing that we move so slow that you disappear. In then you move so fast that you disappear.

And that the idea is that that.

Your I would almost say all those may sound a little bit inscrutable that.

In mindfulness practice.

You first.

Observe impermanence.

And then down the line hopefully.

You'll learn to ride on impermanence.

In live it, I have it animates you that, but in Zen, the style of the monastery the style of the training.

With its spontaneity and it's

Demand to perform without thinking.

What that does is that causes you to ride on impermanence and if you live in permanents?

In that lifestyle.

Then eventually you'll be able to see impermanence in your sensory experience. It's almost like they approach the same issue from opposite directions.

So then it has a kind of bouncy vitality to it, and a kind of claw or creativity that is.

Characteristic of it, sometimes the Hinayana form of Buddhism that be personal.

It's sort of like prosaic an sort of like I don't know lowkey.



And.

Doll and boring, but it's like a good it gets the job done.

It's like a carefully crafted essay, but Zen stylistically is like an energetic pole.

So.

It's a whole different style of Enlightenment, a whole different expression of enlightenment. Yet it's the same enlightenment.
