Once again welcome as I always say it is well that you have come you come along way.

To come to this practice.

And we'll be talking about this practice will be talking about the concepts that you need for this practice and will be giving you a chance to do the techniques that will develop the core skills of this practice.

You already know the big picture. We do this for our self and we do this for others. People go through a certain education process in school and usually at the end of school. It's OK. I'm sort of done the education piece.

So life is sort of a school for People.

And at some point, most People reach a point where they have the perception well, I've sort of.

You know, I'm.

I've grown as.

As much as I need to grow.

I'm an adult I'm established I've got this, or that.

I don't need a radical new something I completed my education.

But some People mature to the point where they realize that there's one more.

Level.

I'm learning as a human that is available if you want to.

That's

Watt, each and everyone of you has reached you've reached that point of maturity where you're ready for sort of the last.

Muscle.

For the human you had to go through a lot of different lessons.

But the last lesson is the one that.

Is designed to?

Bring you to total happiness.

Happiness.

Then.

Is?

Dependent on conditions, but also to a happiness that is independent of conditions.

For yourself and for others this might be called total happiness so this is the continuing education.

That we came here to get.

And I want to congratulate each and everyone of you for.

Being that old that adult that you reached the point where you're ready to do what few People are actually ready to do at this point in human history.

Things were different in the past and things will probably be different in the future but recently.

The last many thousands of years is recently rather few humans have reached this point but you have.

That's extraordinary.

Add.

It will be my privilege my joy.

To facilitate this process for you.



Totally.

Jazz.

Ready to go.

And we're going to have a great week, thank you.
