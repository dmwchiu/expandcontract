I'm going to recite.

La noche Oscura The Dark Knight by someone Delacruz Saint John of the cross.

Saint John is considered to be one of the greatest poets in the Spanish language.

But he was also one of the greatest Mystics in the history of Christianity.

So that brings together 2 extraordinary worlds.

Greatness in poetry and.

Depth of spirituality.

When we hear this poem.

At the end, it leaves us with two tastes simultaneously, which is the greatness of it.

It's able to convey in a poetic way as opposed to a prosaic way.

The.

Ascential character of Mystical Experience, which is paradoxical.

Mystical experiences.

Experience that is simultaneously deeply.

Sensorially Rich,

And at the same time, utterly vacuous.

And.

But knighted.

He's able to.

Give us the taste of two things simultaneously.



On the surface, it seems to be talking about.

A young girl sneaking out secretly at night for a romantic.

Adventure.

But of course, it's really a direct description of his own experience.

Of Oneness with the spiritual source.

In a state so deep.

That self in World, as a thing have disappeared.

As but yet.

Their richness.

Has reached?

Its fullest form at exactly the same time in exactly the same experience.

So we can taste after you at the end of the poem.

If you sort of close your eyes.

You'll see you're left with the paradoxical taste.

Of Mystical experience.

A sense of great.

Richness.

And fulfillment.

And a sense of utter vacuity.

Timeless spaceless transparency.

Both at exactly the same time.

Coming from exactly the same source.

And when I know Cheryl's good.
