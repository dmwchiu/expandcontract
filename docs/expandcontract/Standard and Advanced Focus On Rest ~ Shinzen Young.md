One of my pet phrases is when you say nothing is happening as I'm sitting there.

Either literally nothing is happening in which case you are in.

You are in cessation.

Here in Nirvana itself.

That's great or that's not the case in which case 6. Things are happening your body is physically relaxed your eyes are defocused your ears that you focus your body is emotionally neutral your mental screen is blank in your head is quiet pets 6 sensory events are going on. If you pay attention to those as tangible events. Then something is happening. One nothing much is happening.

And that brings a clarity component into the experience of nothing. Much is happening and guess what that will now tend to bring a growth component back into the big picture of your practice.

The absorption jhana shamatha practice.

As it's described represents a thinning out of self in the world.

What is thin is penetratable?

Will you go into these absorption States and then you penetrate the restful factors or the jonak factors for me. It's restful factors. You awareness soaks into them and what do they become flow and go?

They break up into vibrating point.

So there's what's called soup. Copypasta non, which is driving parcela where if we put it into my language. You go directly from touch sight sound or feel image talk. You do a direct penetration and it dissolves into vibrating Floyd.

That's called drive a personal or there's the absorption path where you get things all thinned out once again my personal language.

Instead of touch side sound it's relaxation light silence.

Instead of feeling its talk it's peaceful and quiet.

Then you penetrate those into Phone call because there are more easily penetrated because they're more thinned a but either way.

Sketch into the same result so focus on change once again.

Speak enters in when you do the beep a salon whether called the proposal and John's where you're penetrating the jonak factors.

So that's why I have to focus on change.

Focus on rest.

As I like to teach it to People.

There are 2 two sort of ways of doing at the standard way that I just described working with restful flavors and then there's the advanced version of focus on rest, which I call? Do nothing but I have a very clear definition of what it means to do nothing OK do nothing isn't twiddle your thumbs and let your mind wander there. There's a certain way to do nothing that allows you to do that.

To have that be growth experience and do nothing is my reworking once again a reworking I don't claim these are the same thing.

It's modified reworked but it's my reworking of the The Whole.

Bundle of approaches that we find worldwide that might be described as anti meditation.

In the sense that.

Instead of

Making an effort.

Instead of

Engaging in.

The Noble Quest.

You in the words of one of the teachers in that tradition.

Papa G you call off the search. I love that phrase call off the search.

You stop.

Trying to Meditate and you.

Stop trying to do anything and you just abide.

Without trying you come to abide.

In the nature of consciousness.

In the Tibetan tradition this is zone chair and Mohamad draw.

In terms of Zen somebody early zan. Tranquille illumination schools of them where they wouldn't. They just like it was a non doing some interpretations of just sitting some interpretations of Choiceless Awareness. Some interpretations of non dual awareness sort of work this way.

As I mentioned there's 2 sides to the path and it's paradoxical there's a.

A place for bearing down there's a place for easing up there's a place for.

Doing something and there's a place for.

Not doing anything at all.

So, but not doing anything at all, I call do nothing.

If I had to say what?

What's my model in it as I understand it? Which admittedly certainly not a scholar or a deep practitioner of that tradition. But I have some sense of what it's about and I use my own categories, and so they made.

Made something that is based on those their themes.

They talk about.

The spacious nature of consciousness.

But they also talk about the effortless spontaneous dynamic nature of consciousness.

I take that effortless dynamic nature of consciousness.

To be

The.

The flow aspect.

Even within the sort of do nothing approach.

You're not certainly not meditating on change.

They're not doing focus on change, but

The fact is as you come to abide in the spacious nature of consciousness that dynamism of that, spacious nature presents itself to you.

As effortless expansion and contraction.

So even the do nothing is not totally unrelated to the themes of focus on change.
