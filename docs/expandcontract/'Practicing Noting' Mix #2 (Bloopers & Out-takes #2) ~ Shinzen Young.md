I see what's missing is People.







Specifically, People bearing guru coffee.

The Guru Coffee delivery.

The wisdom water.



Yes, now.

The project begins to flow.



You know, I don't normally talk like this shins in but when I hear you do something like this. I gotta say you're a ******* genius.

Party pardon the French yes.

Yeah, there. There are times when darn just isn't enough.

It's like when you hit your thumb with a hammer you know, saying Oh.

Well, now, I've got local global of pleasant self preferential aprobacion flavors so.

I thank you for that and I can get the spread. I'm getting on zooming in and out. The primary is here, but it's down there there in there, too.











OK, now I'm going to get to use a real real equord in face single person in this room knows what this word means I am going to be immensely surprised.

Now you're always there.



Now mind you there are approximately 1/2 million words.

Not 1/4 quarter, no about 1/2 point, yeah about 1/2 million words.

The word doesn't pop up into my talk space lists and Cephalic SILISSENCEPHALIC.

Our brains got too big for our skulls, so they developed convolutions so we have these.

These gyrion salicide.

But if you look at a rat brain.

Flat.

It's through the surface is smooth, so non convoluted brain type.

I've called this in cephalic.

So why is this related to anything?

Well, the problem is the convolutions obscured the organization of the brain that's like especially in a human brain.

So they have what they call it exploded brains that a computer could do where it makes it into a giant ball. So then it makes you see how it's really organized. It's more intuitive but you don't need that with a rat brain. It's already that way. And if you look at the mapping of the processing areas in a rats brain.

Here's the part that does the body here's the part that does the auditory there's the part that does the visual?

I suggested that we do as a practice at life focus on positive.

You know during this 10 minutes that we've been not talking.





Since I suggested doing it.

To you folks that means of course, I have to do it.

I got this immediate incredibly subtle hit.

Of fear and sadness.

So if you decide to have a positive social emotion with actual other humans.

Don't be surprised if it may resonate with the other emotion.

For no reason what's the weather ever. Other then suddenly had the temerity to work with field space in front of a group of People.

Yeah, yeah from myself just Oh my God. I'm going to have to like be in pot. It's not like I don't do it, OK, but it's like now. I have to do it and they're going to do it and there was like this fear, which I can understand.

But why the tear.

And I don't need to know because I spotted it and I quantum ized it.
