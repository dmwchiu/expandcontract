Can you tell me what enlightenment is?

So.

Moment by moment you've probably noticed that you have thoughts right.

Set correct and moment by moment you probably notice that you have body sensations.

You've also probably notice that as soon as a thought arises or body sensation rises. There's a tendency to say this thought is me.

At this sensation is me.

That correct nothing mysterious so far.

The next part, you have to sort of use your imagination.

Imagine that you still had thoughts and you still had body sensations, but they?

No longer immediately trapped your identity.

So, your identity is free free to be inside your mind a body like it was before, but also free to move outside of your mind and body to inhabit briefly anyone's mind and body to merge with them.

Or to embrace the entire universe.

Or to abide the still point of the turning world beyond time and space.

Nothingness that precedes The Big Bang so to speak metaphorically speaking.

So.

After Enlightenment,

People's identity becomes elastic.

And the mind and body is no longer.

A place you're locked in it's a home you comfortably can abide in but you can leave anytime you want.

And that's why we also call it liberation being set free.
