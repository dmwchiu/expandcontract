The sensory nature of thought seems to go very, very deep into the unconscious.

Thinking audio video and as far as I can see underneath that audio video is sutler audio and sutler video and underneath that is sutlers. Subliminal audio and supper. Subliminal video and underneath that well? Who knows an ordinary concept of happiness for the body is you get pleasant sensations in the body.

And the body is happy if it can avoid unpleasant sensations.

Well, the mind is happy if it didn't get answers to things and the mind is happy if it can avoid confusion if it can avoid model.

And model can be.

Very intense.

The aging process.

Can model our minds very severely?

Strong emotions can do the same losing our mental capacities is is.

Not going to happen to every person but it's certainly going to happen to some People so not only do we?

Start to get discomforts in the body and lose bodily abilities, but we start to get confusion in the mind as we get senile. We get older than if we were old and we have illness on Top of that we can be in very confused states, even People that were very smart.

Very together in the ordinary sense in their lives can end up very, very muddled mentale. And, of course, the extreme cases are dementing diseases like Alzheimer's. And so forth. It's going to happen to some of us OK job of the mind is to get to know stuff to get answers and when it can't get answers.

Or we're still it's very ability to get answers is compromised and perhaps permanently compromised and the mines. Not very happy. So 2 things gets answers avoids the don't know and the model.

For the month body is happy gets pleasant sensations, physical, emotional avoids unpleasant sensations, physical, emotional so that gives us a way to think about.

Ordinary happiness mindfulness skills.

Increase all these dimensions of ordinary happiness in contradistinction to the PO called ordinary happiness. There's another poll that contrast to that which could be called extraordinary happiness. Let's start with body experience? What we

We think we want is to avoid unpleasant sensations. But what we really want is to avoid the perception of suffering that comes with unpleasant sensation.

Perceived suffering.

Equals intensity of discomfort.

In the body.

Divided by mindfulness.

As concentration clarity and equanimity get bigger.

Even though the intensity of the discomfort remains the same, the perceived suffering will diminish.

And if

Mindfulness becomes big enough.

The perceived suffering due to physical or emotional discomfort in the body can be dropped to effectively 0.

That's liberation from suffering of that sort.

Mindfulness is directly related to a dimension of extraordinary happiness where our concern in the extraordinary happiness domain is not.

Get rid of uncomfortable.

Touch your field in the body are concerned is get rid of uncomfortable touch and feel if it's appropriate or if you can. But when you can't or when you should be experiencing those things because they motivate and direct you.

Under those circumstances experience the mindfully so that they become more poignant.

And less problematic.

Although that seems somewhat contradictory.

Their experience more deeply but the suffering the perceived suffering today this country drops so mindfulness pays off. Both ways allows the discomforts in the body to fulfill their function because you're having a complete experience of them You'll bring in concentration sensory clarity and equanimity to them. That's called a complete experience. That's not called getting rid of.

Get rid of them and if it's appropriate or or you can and it's appropriate. But when it's not appropriate to get rid of them or you can't it would be appropriate. But you just can't.

Then the mindfulness will allow you to experience that discomfort with diminished suffering and in the most extreme place no suffering.

Again, the dimension of extraordinary happiness. Our goal is essentially not to avoid discomfort in the body. But to avoid suffering in the body by having a complete experience of discomfort in the body.

Likewise, in the domain of extraordinary happiness. Our goal is not merely to have pleasure.

But to have fulfillment now, it turns out that fulfillment equals pleasure multiplied by mindfulness.

Small pleasure lot of mindfulness lot of satisfaction.

Bad news big pleasure, not very much mindfulness.

I can't get no satisfaction.

The Imelda Marcos for not how many pairs of shoes will satisfy you.

If you don't know how to derive fulfillment from pleasure.

100, * 0, is still zero 1000, * 0, is still zero 2000. I think that's what she eventually got up too, but.

It couldn't deliver the goods I can't get no satisfaction.

The dimension.

Of extraordinary happiness are concerned becomes not merely getting pleasure.

But deriving fulfillment and eventually.

Enormous fulfillment from whatever pleasure is there.

The preoccupation with avoiding.

Discomfort is

Replaced with the Noble Quest.

4.

Freedom from suffering and the preoccupation with getting pleasure is replaced by the Noble Quest.

Of achieving.

Total fulfillment which of course implies?

No more driven nahs.

But does not imply imply for a moment, a lack of dynamic motivation.

But you can have conditions that are producing pain in the body and there's no pleasure in the body.

Still, happen extraordinary happiness is happiness independent of conditions.

External object if conditions.

What it mainly depends on is a user base level of mindfulness?

And that's good news.

Because.

We can elevate our mind from us as far as we want so that means we can be in the realm of extraordinary happiness is no limit as to how happy we can be what about the mind.

In the world of extraordinary happiness.

The mines not preoccupied not in this or that question.

It is interested in the question.

And extraordinary happiness comes about when the mind gets the answer to the question and what is the question the question is Watt? am I?

When the mines got an answer to that it knows its source.

I would call that Salvation to know your source directly.

And I would call that wisdom.

The.

Preoccupation with this with that question.

Is in the realm of extraordinary happiness replaced with the preoccupation with the question?
