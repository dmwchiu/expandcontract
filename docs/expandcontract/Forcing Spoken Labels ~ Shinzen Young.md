The forcing yourself to say the labels.

Has caused the invisible force?

Of scattered.

Come up as a tangible sensation of impatience.

You can detect it in the body right now start, noting that either note. The impatient locations or just noted as feel if you want to use a generic technique so let's say that you're noting feel image talk and the image and talk go away because you're forcing yourself to say the labels out loud.

However, what happens to feel is that now there's an agitated uncomfortable quality of the field.

So then you would not feel feel with spoken labels and the more you speak the more that discomfort comes up. But that's good because that's observable that's a set a somatic quality. It has location. It has intensity. It has flavor in the body. You can observe it and you can open up to it. The whole idea. In doing something like spoken labels.

Is to take invisible patterns of force that scatter our attention?

And transmute them into observable patterns of sensation or perhaps also image Doc. But usually it's an agitated sensation and observable pattern of sensation that you can then work with because invisible patterns of force, are extremely difficult to work with. They've just what you described they just got you cite your observing and now you're not observing you're not.

On the edge of the stream you are you have entered the stream and not in the good sense.

Not enough carried by the stream of Enlightenment, you're being drowned in the stream of Karma. Now you're uncomfortable in the body. That means that the spoken labels have made an invisible pattern of force. That's been scattering you into an observable trackable pattern of.

Sensation all be, it, perhaps are very uncomfortable sensation, but it is still trackable and you can note that sensation.

And what is trackable eventually becomes tractable?

And you will have worked through the invisible scattering force, which is intractable.

One of the very elegant and clever features of mindfulness practice is I repeat. It takes invisible an intractable problem, which is force forces are controlling me that I don't like.

And there's nothing I can do about it.

And it transforms that problem, a problem of dealing with invisible forces.

Into the problem of observing.

Actual body sensations.

And then as you eat quantum eyes that you solve that problem that translates back into now. Those forces no longer have a hold on huge fundamental.

Tool.

So that's why it may have sound cavalier at even mean when I said Oh that's great. You're like all agitated and miserable because you're doing the spoken labels, but it was neither cavalier normally.

It's the name of the game.

Solid nothing Soto voci labeling and.

If that doesn't work, then stay away from the zendo for half a day and just force yourself to do the labels. I know, People don't want to do it, but it works, and you know you don't have that much time you have lives. You took time away from your lives you paid money to come here to do some work.

I'm ethically bound to tell you what's going to make that affective.

Even though it might not be what you want to hear.

There's 3 reasons People don't want to do spoken labels.

Number one, it's very hard work.

And we sort of think well, I came here to instead of like have this mellow experience. I don't want to have to work. It's hard work, but that's what we came to do so.

First cause of resistance hard work second cause it's going to make you uncomfortable hopefully.

OK and 30 is.

This proves what I've always known. I'm a child of a lesser God. I've been sent back to the person on one only also known as dumb Bellevue possible so.

Yes, I've been sent back to dumbbell vipasana.

But here's my metaphor remember I say that you have these labeling options.

Strongly spoken label, Middle Spoken Label Whispered Label Mental label. No label at all. It's true, it's as a general principle. You want to work towards actually no labels at all if possible.

But.

You can think of those label options as like gears in your car.

Uh.

If you're going up a steep Hill, meaning.

What makes a Hill steep as you're sitting?

Is?

One or both of the following.

Lot of Doo Doo coming from the outside world.

Lot to do coming from the lot of data coming from the inside world. So one or both of those means you're going up a Hill.



The fact that when you go up a very steep Hill.

You have to put your

Rolls Royce into first gear.

Does it mean it's not a Rolls Royce? It has a first gear?

For a reason at those options are there for a reason. It's not being sent back to dumb Delfi personal it's using the apparat the standard apparatus of the technique in the way that.

You're was suggested to use it. So it's like now, I'm not I don't care what?

I'm not going to put my car in first. I'm going to go up. This Hill under cruise control. I don't care what I don't want anybody. Tell me this is a crummy car doesn't work that way. It's a piece of machinery. It's designed to work that way.
