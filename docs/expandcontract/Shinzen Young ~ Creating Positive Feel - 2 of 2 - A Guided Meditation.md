Let's explore it so once again take a moment to stretch up and settle in.

And now this time.

We're going to actively create positive field if possible, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't we'll just see.

So I'd like you to think some thought. That's likely to produce a pleasant feel in your body.

And then focus here on that.

And it will either continue to resonate or it will.

Dampen and I away.

If that happens rethink either the same thought or a different one.

And then drop the thought and focus on the pleasant residents in the body for as long or as short as it may last.

That makes sense.

Now, one thing that can help this.

Is to intentionally smile just a little bit?

Like to put the smile little hint of a smile.

Notice how that produces pleasant feel.

And that can fortify the process.











Able to do that to a certain extent.

Excellent.

Let's stay with it for a few more minutes.



Laughter counts as positive feeling.

Let it spread as broadly as you can.





Might might go out in your body.



As you do this.

Try to actually taste how it develops a concentrated state.

You're very focused urine simiti you're in the zone.

And your object of focus is this pleasant experience.

And the more concentrated you become the more pleasant. It becomes motivating you to become even more one pointed.

With this.

Pleasant flavor that creates a positive feedback loop.

That Revs up your

Concentration power?

That makes sense as a concept.

Excellent.









Now.

Stay with that concentration in your pleasant emotional body.

But open your eyes eyes open, but awareness back.

Into the positive field.

Good now make eye contact and see if you can set. It just keep some awareness during the social interaction takes a little bit of practice.

So any final questions or comments.

No.

Well, I think this was an excellent session and.

There's actually a lot more to say about the technique, but you can read about that at basic mindfulness data work. You can look. There's like a reference guide to all the different aspects. I just taught you some parts of it, but clearly you have enough to.

To implement it and that's excellent thanks for helping out to make this video thank you.

OK, it's a rap.
