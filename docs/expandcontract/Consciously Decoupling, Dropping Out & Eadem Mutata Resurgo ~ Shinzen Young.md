So when I have you work with?



Things like touch sight sound that kind of thing.

Working in the in the object of spaces.

You might say Well, like site and touch if your eyes are open site in touch are always there. I mean, obviously right your physical body is always there, the world's always there.

But what can happen is that you, you can disconnect that's just be couple is just my geek way of saying disconnect.

That can be a if you're let's say you're working in these site type system.

It's possible that you could for a moment disk disconnect from that system.

Either because you're

About to go into reverie.

Or you're getting sleepy.

So for so that disconnect.

Actually, causes a



And it's a restful state.

You're not looking at things.

No, you are sleepy open and you're all those sensation maybe arising in your body your.

Attention is going elsewhere.

So all you could feel that it's there.

OK, so it causes a restful state to rise for a moment and that's your tell you understanding poker you know what to tell is it's a giveaway.

So you know what's going on?

Buy some.

External sign.

So.

I want to train People to detect the moment when they're being pulled away from their object of meditation.

The way you detect that is by noticing that.

For just a brief moment.

Where you have been focusing on active states it's not gone restful because you disconnected and I sometimes?

Sort of obscurely call that deep coupling because it's like in fit in like a magnetic fields. You know there will be a coupling and then they they just disconnect one of its own flux lines D couple.

And you notice that and then you come back to whatever your object is so you've got that you got like.

You know.

One or 2 seconds.

Where it goes restful?

Right before you're either sinking or think.

And if you know that then that will bring you back to your focus space.

Yeah, you were dropping now of course, you have an option if your D coupling and you're dropping into really deep restful states. Then you know, maybe it's time to focus on rest for awhile.

Because you had a conscious drop out because you have the categories, the restful categories to work with.

It was for a beginner meditator would have been a not out.

OK would have been allowed out for a beginner, but because of all the.

Long years of practice.

It was a dropout.

I drop out of the time space Continuum.

A moment with the source.

So when you drop back in.



The world was.

Well, we could say.

It.

With this, but we were in a Catholic place so Latins good. This is Christian Christian phrase, I add them to wrestle.

I I was rent. I was resurrected the same but change.
