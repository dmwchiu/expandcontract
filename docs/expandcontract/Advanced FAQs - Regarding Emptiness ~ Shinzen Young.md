From advanced students, the most common question is How do I deal with?

The pit of emptiness? How do I deal with the dark night of the soul? How do I deal with these seeming Los of my humanity and the loss of my edge and my dynamic motivations that have come about because of experiencing emptiness and I've talked at length in other segments about how one deals with that essentially it's a combination of.

If you're freaking out because of emptiness see that the freak out is empty.

That's number one and #2 balanced the emptiness with practices like focus on positive where you're intentionally re creating a new self from the emptiness anew an positive self.

So the combination for the advanced student that frequent question. What do I do about seeming negative consequences of avoid is?

Number one well if you're having.

Some sort of fear or other kinds of disorientation or freak out as the result of the void then see that that reaction is itself void.

That combined with

OK, well emptiness is only half the picture focus on positive intentionally creating a new self.

Out of the emptiness, but intentionally by holding manifesting and radiating positive feel image talk.

As a consistent practice those 2 things is sort of negate the negative. The negative reactions to the void and then you affirm conditioned arising by creating.

A new self.

Intentionally under had better self those 2 are.

What I suggest for dealing with the so called pit of emptiness which is I think the most frequent question from advanced students.
