So it can happen in our sensory experience.

That we could be aware of change and the forces and enerji that produce change.

And I called that aspect that theme.

The dynamic aspect of experience if the change has the form of.

An abrupt diminishing then I call that a vanishing even if it doesn't completely vanish.

And all the other aspects of change. I call flow. Now there's lots of different flavors of flow flow can be sort of like bubbly or it could be WAVY.

And so forth.

But in the formulation that I like to use behind all the different flavors of flow are 2 oppositely directed.

Flavors of flow that will refer to abstractly as expansion and contraction.

Sasaki Roshi has a list of several dozen synonyms for this contrast, an many of the synonyms are confusing don't seem to have anything to do with the other synonyms sort of weird People out. But what he's trying to do is point out that many things that superficially appear to be unrelated. In fact at a deep level.

Reflect these 2 sides of nature.

He'll sometimes call them put us process with minus can you understand for us who?

For us Minusu.

Yes told means and so plus it'll minus.

Interesting Lee very, very seldom will he ever say.

Are.

Yo to yen in Toyota OK in is Jen OK and you always young right, although clearly these are related to the Dallas. The yen and Yang very seldom does. He say in your prefers to use the English minus.

But behind it is obviously the Dallas background of E Asian thought.

Mixed with the

Indic element of the notion that there's a cancellation of yen. And Yang called 0 expansion is the principle of increase contraction is the principle of decrease expansion is the principle of outward movement outward force.

Contraction is the principle of inward movement inward force.

So that means that as you're paying attention to sensory experience.

If anything increases that's expansion so expansion isn't this mysterious thing that someday if you finally grow up. You'll be able to experience.

If you have a pain and it's getting bigger that's expansion.

If you're listening to a sound and it's getting smaller and smaller and smaller as the airplane goes away. That's contraction. Don't tell me you never experienced expansion or contraction any increase any decrease.

Represents these underlying principles.

So what can increase well intensity level can increase.

Of what anything but talk in your head pain in your body hot cold.

Light so expansion right contraction.

No more mysterious than that.

One thing that can increase and decrease is intensity level. What else could increase in decrease well vibrations can speed up and slow down.

The talk in your head can get louder and softer, but could also get faster or slower. The spiking pain in your knee can spike at a certain level that it could speed up a whole lot. Then it could slow down a little bit so the sort of frequency of something can increase or decrease.

In your body you may be aware of.

Pressures if you take any pressure.

You can analyze it ask yourself is it outward inward or both at the same time frequently. It's both at the same time, and frequently their clashing producing a sense of discomfort, but that's OK. That's those are still forces expansion contraction forces.

Have you notice that your mind could be scattered in many directions.

And I can obsess on one thing.

That could be looked upon as a problem or that can simply be looked upon as a manifestation of expansion and contraction.

And not a problem, just part of the flow of nature.



If the attention is scattered.

In many directions at once.

And you're focused on the fact that it's scattered.

Then you have high concentration on expansion.

And yes, you let that happen with this technique.

An and you give up the need to have order.

And you just let yourself be sort of.

Always at once kind of thing, but there is concentration and clarity or clear that you're scattered and you're focused on.

How your your blown in all directions at once so yes with this technique let that happen and if you can't get off something and it's like you're like nailed to it.

You can parse that as the contract if force an not fight with it.

Most importantly,

The spatial scope of a sensory phenomenon can increase or decrease.

As I have set up these categories touch sight sound feel image talk every one of them has depth with an height.

Now the depth width and height might not be well defined might be sort of cloud like a nebulous but there is.

A right left measure there's a front back measures up down measure roughly for any of the spaces. Even the mind has a front and a back visual part that tends to appear in front and an auditory part, that tends to be more posterior relative to that talk space. Not very well defined spatially, but image space. You got the images in the center of image space. The images around you images of your own body.

At space, the space occupied by a sensor event.

May increase or decrease usually?

It does one of the other very seldom do all 3 dimensions of a sensory volume remained completely fixed.

So if it gets a little wider expansion if it gets a little narrower contraction. If it gets a little larger in the front back. Demension deeper depth increases expansion depth decreases contraction lengthens expansion.

Shortens contraction.

Uh.

Lengthens and at the same time pause in to the sides and in the front and back.

Both.

My balls, OK, it's expanding and Wonder Demension, attracting along the other if you take.

Spaghetti dough OK or something and you pull it.

It will expand.

An contract at the same time.

Any change in spatial volume along 1, two or all three of the axes.

Counts as expansion and contraction for anything touch sight sound field image talk or the corresponding restful states for that matter.

The increase in decrease in intensities.

And the increase in decrease in frequencies and the inwards an outward pressures in the body and the scattering and grouping forces in the mind.

In the end all present themselves if you look carefully.

As stretching zan squeak and or squeezings of the spatial volume.

Of experience a spatial volume of sensory experience if you have a pain.

You know how you can measure it is with depth site take that altogether. That's it's spatial volume so.

Things's quenching along one dimension, they push pull out along another mentioned and sometimes the whole spatial volume can increase the whole spatial volume could decrease all all three axes, it wants spreading collapsing.

When you become very sensitive to the moment of arising.

Of a sensor event, you see that as that sensor event transitions from not existence into existence.

It occupies it creates a volume of space.

And.

When that sensor event disappears completely that volume of Space disappears that it occupies.

If you Totale 100%.

Affirm a sensory event at the moment of arising.

If if you're just like instantly with it and instantly giving the big yes.

Then.

You'll see that as soon as it's arising it's already passing already passing.

It's arising in its in its beginning as it send OK as TS Eliot set as its arising it's already passing that means there's a simultaneous growth.

Of spatial volume and a shrinkage of spatial volume right right behind that in time so that it's both moving out and in at the same time.

I just give this to you as a heads up. There is nothing in the world that you can do to make that experience available but.

Just you now have a vocabulary in the language in just in case you should ever notice that as soon as something is arising. It's also passing temporally. Its space is expanding and spaces contracting right behind that at the same time, producing a bidirectional flux.

At a local level.

That will often take the form of.

By flow and then a complete disappearance of banishing so both gone both got both gone.

At a local level.

That sums at a global level to the to an experience of.

Everything is signed up is simultaneously born in between expanding contracting spirit flow and that expanding contracting spirit. Flow is peppered with trillions of vanishings that give it a profound tranquility at the same time.

So it got literally goes everywhere.

Everywhere meaning as far out as out and as far in as in can be and goes nowhere at exactly the same time.

That's the theme of expensive contractive flow.



Thousands of thousands of human beings over the centuries have become completely enlightened without ever once using the word expansion and contraction.

So.

Don't make a big deal out of this, it's just a theme that can be explored.
