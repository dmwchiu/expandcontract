We can't always have enough concentration clarity and equanimity to have a complete experience of something.

But maybe we can have a little bit of concentration.

Or, a little bit of clarity or a little bit of equanimity.

And that's not too shabby.

Maybe we can hardly have. We can't have any concentration clarity and equanimity at all under certain circumstance but we can have equanimity with that.

We can accept that that's the case and we can continue to.

Do formal practice despite the fact that we have essentially no concentration. No clarity in all equanimity. However, we're still setting the stage for nature to do its job, where catalyzing a natural process. We're giving nature what it needs on the surface. It seems like we're wasting our time.

Doing a formal practice because it's like total monkey mind total confusion mind total like lausten, emotional chaos sleepy.

Aches and pains OK, it seems like we're wasting our time however.

Deep down.

Slowly changes are taking place, even under those circumstances because we're giving nature a chance. If you have a lot of concentration clarity and equanimity great you can explore the possibility of complete experience.

But if you can't have concentration or clarity. Maybe you can have some equanimity. If you see what I'm saying there's always a way to look at it positively so if you can't have all three try to have one or 2 if you can't have any at all keep doing the formal practice.

Um because that's still doing some good in the long term, so you can always go do? What seems like going through the motions. It's still better than just completely acquiescing to desperate and hopeless wretchedness, human condition.

However, on occasion and certainly with practice.

Given enough time enough time might be a lot of time folks OK, you'll start to get hints of an experience of sensory completeness.



Where things get really extraordinary is when you can have a complete experience of feel image talk?

All at once.

That integrates.

The mind and the emotions into a single arabesque of empty Energi.

So there's a Oneness and nothingness there. The world of concept, and the world of emotion, which are often thought of as you know the head and the heart being separate OK, so they had in the heart literally are integrated that's the Oneness theme.

OK, they're integrated by having a complete experience simultaneously of feel image talk so.

Completely present in the moment that there's no.

Time to fixate them and they manifest as a wave rather than a zep articulate thing called the cell.

Or thing called?

Thought and feeling.

So that's quite an integration that's quite a theme of Oneness right there.

But there can be a broader theme of Oneness.

That would be the theme of integrating not just the head in the heart.

But the mind and the whole body, not just the emotional body. But the physicality of the body touch space as I call it if feel is the emotional sensations. All the other sensations? What are we going to call them. The Itches and makes the pressures and pains the sleepiness sensations ordinary Physiology. The pulse etc. Etc hot and cold bladders full stomachs empty. All that sort of stuff. I call them touches whether they're on the surface or on the inside.

Body is touched feel space well.

There's a tradition in mindfulness practice. It's not a requirement that it's something that's done by some People sometimes it's very interesting. You can learn a lot from it. It's done in other traditions too. But in our tradition. It's called strong determination city.

Edit Anna in the Pali language and it means you make a decision for a certain period of time. I'm not going to make any voluntary movement.

Typically, it's a minimum of one hour, but I guess you know theoretically could be anything. One hour, 2 hours, 3 hours for half a day. Whatever you want to do I did a retreat once?

In Australia was a 2 month retreat and it was great. It was like not I didn't have to run a retreat. I was taking a retreat for 2 months.

Didn't have to do anything but meditate?

And, of course I wanted to make optimal use of that time, the way the schedule work. There was this nice 4 hour slot.

In the afternoon.



So I decided the first day OK.

For the next 2 months. I'll do a 4 hour strong determination sit during this slot see what happens you know what happens right.

Edit aid pretty.





What happens is that after about an hour you start to get some really significant pain?

And then after about an hour and a half.

Your you know your

Gnashing your teeth in your

Your hands are now a sweaty fist.

And you know, then your body starts to shake uncontrollably and then.

You're flooded with huge emotions of fear and mental confusion and distorted thinking Ida Shun and then start to lose control of your body your eyes start to go up into your head and you can feel like it's horrible really, really bad, however.

It is, after all.

Just a huge eruption of touch feel image talk, the will. The freak out is in feel image talk, the pain is in the touch.
