OK, maybe we have time for one or more other questions. Harper car just something I've noticed around the wandering mind is very much related often to focus on positive, it's just that it's a It's an unconscious focus on positive. So when a person's mind is wandering in meditation and it's a problem for them.

Often, if they are able to detect the.



The pleasure component or the interest component at that point.

They make it conscious an it's become like a positive focus technique if they're able to actually do that so.

In.

In sharing this with students what has become very interesting is where before the wandering mind for them drove him crazy.

Now it's like can I catch the wandering mind when it's actually kind of an unconscious positive focus and make it into a conscious?

Positive focus and then they can stay with that play with it or not they can go back to their technique.

And so anyways, it's just become like another.

Window of opportunity for them. That's cool and that involves.

Detecting the

Pleasant interest flavor, absolutely, yeah, that's that's pivotal.

Yeah, the 3 hours my theory of what drives human attention for 3 hours.

Tear cheer fear other words, sadness interest and fear. I find are the basic flavors that control where our attention those and whereas at the beginning, the wandering mine is a source of suffering they can reframe it so that the wandering mind becomes turns into freedom from suffering that's really clever could I use that.

If you're working with the do nothing technique.

And what often of course, prevents People from.

Having to do nothing technique be a quote.

Could experience experience?

So there's a way to do the do. Nothing technique where you alternate between the do. Nothing technique and the making wandering mine into a positive focus anything kind of.

Play with that go ahead and use that too. So we need a we need a a quick term for this thing that you're doing with the wandering mind.

I think I think I've come up with the name of the technique.

We'll call it the Happy Wanderer.
