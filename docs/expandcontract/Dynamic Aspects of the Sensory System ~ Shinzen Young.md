These are the 12 basic sensory experiences that I have People work with.

6 restful flavors relaxation light silence peace blank quiet and 6 ordinary flavors that correspond to those touch sight sound feel image talk.

Any of these sensory categories when it arises could be completely still and stable.

On the other hand.

It might not be perfectly still unstable any of these sensory experiences could.

Flow they could change they could be WAVY. Vibra Tori, Angela Tori. There could be spreading or collapsing. There could be inward or outward forces. Expansive forces contractive forces In other words inside the ordinary experiences of touch sight sound feel image talk and the restful experiences of relaxation light silence peace blind quiet.

There could on occasion be a dynamic aspect. I like the word dynamic because dynamic if you look it up in the dictionary is defined as relating to change or the forces or energies that produce change.

So when you're working with these sensory categories. It could happen that you become aware of the dynamic aspect being present in one or many of them, meaning you awareness is drawn to the fact that there's change or that there's enerji force within it.

Energies an interesting word because until it was incorporated as a technical term in the vocabulary of physics. Not that long ago, maybe a couple 100 years ago. Until then, Enerji was a technical term in the vocabulary of Christian meditator's and it meant pretty much what I'm talking about awareness of the spirit moving through ones.

Body mind and so forth and the world actually and breaking things up dissolving you reducing you in the sense of taking you back to the source.

If the dynamic aspect presents itself in any of these states. I will have People if they wish focus on that, if it's a kind of continuous change. Then I refer to that as flow flow, as I say could happen in any of these.

Another kind of changes the discontinuous change where something abruptly vanish is and I call that vanishing when People label. It they label gone.

As you're working with ordinary a restful experience if flow or vanishing becomes evident and if you so desire you can focus on that and that will bring about a whole bunch of very interesting and important experiences that I describe my websites in an article on the significance of flow there's another article.

Called return to the source where I talk about the significance of the abrupt banishing experiences that gives another theme, which is the dynamic aspect so People can focus on ordinary experience. They can focus on restful experience or if the dynamic aspect of nature presents itself within those experiences they can focus on that.
