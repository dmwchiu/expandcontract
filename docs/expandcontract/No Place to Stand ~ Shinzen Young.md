OK, we use metaphors for this practice, we meaning all the mindfulness teachers in the world.

And those metaphors are metaphors and if they help you good and if they get in the way not good.

One of the metaphors for equanimity is.

And it's standard wanted it's used by very famous and teachers.

You sit on the Bank of the River and we can watch it.

But that is just a metaphor for equanimity.

That's not what equanimity is.

OK.

Ah.

One of the things about the way I teach that People often find weird is I don't actually give you a home base to go back to lot of People give you the breaths like OK just keep coming back to the breath.

Why doesn't shinzen do that? Well, not against it totally valid way to practice but there is a reason why I don't give you a place to stand.

And I quote no less an authority.

Then one of the great enlightened Masters of China, then Jeep.

Who says you are with inside of every human being?

There is

An authentic person.

That has no position.

Wait drunken

The authentic human with no position.

If I were to characterize.

The experience of Zen practice at Mount Baldy.

I would say it is decentering you've heard of centering prayer that's D centering prayer.

Gives you know place to stand.

It's very disorienting.

Uh.

When you finally give up the notion that you're going to have a place.

To stand.

That's when that figure ground reversal takes voice that's when you're doing 3 dimensional's in.

As opposed to flat Sam which would be the Zen put down of the WAVY person is often done.

From a fixed perspective.

I'm over here.

Sitting on the riverbank watching the River well if that works.

Right.

At some point you will become the River without being caught in the room if it works right.

But if it doesn't work right you're going to spend 20 or 30 years on the Bank of the River and never be liberated.

So I don't want you to have a place to stand, I want.

I don't want you to have a center.

I want the center to have you.

It's a completely different experience.

It's intentional.

So it is hugely not a problem.

If you cannot find a place to stand while you do be possible.

It's like hugely not a problem. It will be a problem. If you don't have some modicum of concentration clarity and equanimity.

But that's why I asked you. The question about the spoken labels once I determined that you had.

But you were doing something that I can say with confidence have salute. Lee do not try to find a place to stand in general ever.

And just let the place.

That's I don't know if you know that the very common word.

In Ordinary, Israeli Hebrew for God's how much com that means the place the place, but the place.

Find you rather than you find a place.
