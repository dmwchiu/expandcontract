<p>The just occured to me, too right.</p>
<p>The term.</p>
<p>For no self in.</p>
<p>The Islamic tradition of Sufism, which is phenom.</p>
<p>Then it occurred to me, it might be interesting to write to look at all the words that are used by the meditating Mystics.</p>
<p>Around the world.</p>
<p>For their version of what humility is.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>So we'll we'll start, where we started last night.</p>
<p>So this is.</p>
<p>Arabic.</p>
<p>It's pronounced fanatic.</p>
<p>FAN.</p>
<p>And that's the technical term in the Sufi tradition.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Watt, in the Buddhist tradition is called no self.</p>
<p>So let's.</p>
<p>Juxtaposed with that Hebrew.</p>
<p>It's also written from right to left.</p>
<p>So this says, Betul Hi Ash.</p>
<p>In.</p>
<p>Paper language that would be romanized.</p>
<p>BITULHA.</p>
<p>Edge.</p>
<p>Betul means annihilation so very similar to funnel.</p>
<p>And ha means the and Yash is something nahs, something Ness of self something. Ness of world or existence. Yesh is the common Hebrew word for exist.</p>
<p>So the annihilation of something is.</p>
<p>Of Self, an world pretty much sums it up.</p>
<p>By the way after Betul Hi Ash.</p>
<p>Comes pre are once you annihilate the something nahs.</p>
<p>Then you become the doing this.</p>
<p>So you are able to participate in the flip side of the annihilation which is the.</p>
<p>Pre ieshima iron the moment by moment continuous arising of Yesh things met from iron the divine nothing.</p>
<p>An infant in the Sufi tradition has exactly the same thing after phenom is something called the car.</p>
<p>Which is?</p>
<p>Now you're stabilized with the source and you can understand how the world is coming from God Allah and so forth.</p>
<p>So very parallel type situations, so that's Islam Judaism.</p>
<p>Now let's look at Christianity.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>Early Christianity, the mystical writings were in Greek to called the Greek father's. They lived in the deserts of.</p>
<p>Palestine Egypt and so forth and there's amazing writings from that patristic period. So what is the oldest of the Christian terms for the no self experience?</p>
<p>Wait, a minute I think.</p>
<p>I think that's an Omega sorry I think I misspelled it.</p>
<p>Not a normal Cron, but I could be wrong.</p>
<p>I should really check these things out for I present them to the world.</p>
<p>Kenosis.</p>
<p>If we were to romanize it.</p>
<p>KENOS&amp;O sis doesn't mean a disease by the way it means a process an kennels in Greek means empty.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting Lee directly cognate to the Sanskrit Word Junya.</p>
<p>Because the car sound the valor.</p>
<p>Stop voiceless fellow stop of the car sound in Proto Indoeuropean became a shot, which is a palatalized F in Sanskrit, so actually Sanskrit is modified from the early Proto Indoeuropean Greek still preserves the cuss sound so kennels in Greek is a direct Indoeuropean Cognitive Shinya.</p>
<p>In Sanskrit, an interesting.</p>
<p>Similar spiritual interpretation can Oasys is the process of emptying out.</p>
<p>Emptying out of something nahs that the Christian meditator's sought.</p>
<p>And if if you could achieve a deep enough kenosis.</p>
<p>Then you would be able to experience theosis theosis.</p>
<p>Which means guarding literally see Greek is a very subtle language there's 2 words in God a 2 words in Greek.</p>
<p>Theosis an apotheosis.</p>
<p>Apotheosis is deification in the sense that the ancient Roman emperors claimed to be gods.</p>
<p>But theosis is deification in the sense that the Christian, who empties themselves out.</p>
<p>Takes on</p>
<p>Divine attributes not infinite power and that kind of thing, but the goodness the compassion and so forth.</p>
<p>So you become more God like in that sense, and.</p>
<p>Culminating in</p>
<p>Talk about it subtle use of language and an interesting word. The combination of Kenosis. According to the Greek desert father's is to become ESO restos.</p>
<p>ISO.</p>
<p>You know what that means in Greek means equivalent hisoka restos is Christ equivalent.</p>
<p>Now I like to.</p>
<p>Very irreverently translate that into modern English as.</p>
<p>You experience what it's like to be Nano Christ.</p>
<p>A very, very, very miniature version of dying.</p>
<p>In order to be of service to others.</p>
<p>Your own personal version as opposed to the cosmic version, which is I think that would be the.</p>
<p>The Mega Christ OK, OK, so kenosis.</p>
<p>So now we've got Islam Judaism, Christianity, the western religions. Let's go to.</p>
<p>Buddhism.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Just to put it in an index script for the fun of it.</p>
<p>This is Devanagari, which is the North Indian alphabet used to write Sanskrit Hindi and such but I just wrote a Poly word.</p>
<p>In it, and uh to.</p>
<p>ANATTA.</p>
<p>And this is the famous doctrine of the put out no self as thing.</p>
<p>That gets translated into various Asian languages.</p>
<p>Let's start with.</p>
<p>Tibetan.</p>
<p>Screw that up.</p>
<p>That's how you do it.</p>
<p>Not pretty.</p>
<p>Tibetan it's called document or dominant.</p>
<p>If you romanize it.</p>
<p>BDAG.</p>
<p>Dot Med.</p>
<p>And another dot.</p>
<p>Butitspronounced.net.</p>
<p>And it literally means self and mam beans without or not so that just directly translates.</p>
<p>In.</p>
<p>E Asia,</p>
<p>You got.</p>
<p>Chinese characters as the classical language.</p>
<p>So that's how you write it.</p>
<p>And it exactly corresponds.</p>
<p>Now there's 4 cultures that constitute the.</p>
<p>The sphere of the influence of Chinese characters.</p>
<p>Traditionally, those 4 cultures are of course, China itself.</p>
<p>Vietnam.</p>
<p>Korea and Japan, so there's local pronunciations for this.</p>
<p>Uh let's go down the list in.</p>
<p>Mandarin Chinese.</p>
<p>It would be pronounced.</p>
<p>Woo all.</p>
<p>Womans not existent or does does not exist and war is self so that's exactly like doc bag and Tibetan.</p>
<p>In Vietnamese pronunciation.</p>
<p>Same characters are pronounced.</p>
<p>Volner.</p>
<p>Vietnamese has a very peculiar creaky tone unique to it, Wagner.</p>
<p>You can hear the tones right Vietnamese and Chinese are both tonal languages, so in Mandarin Chinese. It's a rising tone and then a dipping tone wall.</p>
<p>And in Vietnamese you can hear similar Huh Voma.</p>
<p>Well let's write it in Korean Script Koreans have their own alphabet.</p>
<p>I could be wrong about this my Korean is very rusty, but I'm pretty I think it's moohah.</p>
<p>MUA.</p>
<p>But I know for sure what it is in Japanese.</p>
<p>Similar sounding.</p>
<p>Japanese also have their own silver, Berry Kana Muga Mu GA.</p>
<p>The Dow list also had a term for the nothingness of the liberated person.</p>
<p>It's another Chinese word meaning emptiness actually.</p>
<p>This character here.</p>
<p>Which is pronounced she?</p>
<p>And that's sort of the Taoist equivalent.</p>
<p>So, there, we have.</p>
<p>Sort of the world of.</p>
<p>The humility to the vanishing point.</p>
<p>Uh as cultivated in the Western and eastern traditions.</p>
