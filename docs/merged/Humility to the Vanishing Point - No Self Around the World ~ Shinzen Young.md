Yesterday I wrote out.

The just occured to me, too right.

The term.

For no self in.

The Islamic tradition of Sufism, which is phenom.

Then it occurred to me, it might be interesting to write to look at all the words that are used by the meditating Mystics.

Around the world.

For their version of what humility is.

So.

Here we go.



So we'll we'll start, where we started last night.



So this is.

Arabic.

It's pronounced fanatic.



FAN.

And that's the technical term in the Sufi tradition.

4.

Watt, in the Buddhist tradition is called no self.

So let's.

Juxtaposed with that Hebrew.

It's also written from right to left.

So this says, Betul Hi Ash.

In.

Paper language that would be romanized.

BITULHA.

Edge.

Betul means annihilation so very similar to funnel.

And ha means the and Yash is something nahs, something Ness of self something. Ness of world or existence. Yesh is the common Hebrew word for exist.

So the annihilation of something is.

Of Self, an world pretty much sums it up.

By the way after Betul Hi Ash.

Comes pre are once you annihilate the something nahs.

Then you become the doing this.

So you are able to participate in the flip side of the annihilation which is the.

Pre ieshima iron the moment by moment continuous arising of Yesh things met from iron the divine nothing.

An infant in the Sufi tradition has exactly the same thing after phenom is something called the car.

Which is?

Now you're stabilized with the source and you can understand how the world is coming from God Allah and so forth.



So very parallel type situations, so that's Islam Judaism.

Now let's look at Christianity.

Now.

Early Christianity, the mystical writings were in Greek to called the Greek father's. They lived in the deserts of.

Palestine Egypt and so forth and there's amazing writings from that patristic period. So what is the oldest of the Christian terms for the no self experience?

Wait, a minute I think.

I think that's an Omega sorry I think I misspelled it.

Not a normal Cron, but I could be wrong.



I should really check these things out for I present them to the world.

Kenosis.

If we were to romanize it.

KENOS&O sis doesn't mean a disease by the way it means a process an kennels in Greek means empty.

Oh, interesting Lee directly cognate to the Sanskrit Word Junya.

Because the car sound the valor.

Stop voiceless fellow stop of the car sound in Proto Indoeuropean became a shot, which is a palatalized F in Sanskrit, so actually Sanskrit is modified from the early Proto Indoeuropean Greek still preserves the cuss sound so kennels in Greek is a direct Indoeuropean Cognitive Shinya.

In Sanskrit, an interesting.

Similar spiritual interpretation can Oasys is the process of emptying out.

Emptying out of something nahs that the Christian meditator's sought.

And if if you could achieve a deep enough kenosis.

Then you would be able to experience theosis theosis.

Which means guarding literally see Greek is a very subtle language there's 2 words in God a 2 words in Greek.

Theosis an apotheosis.

Apotheosis is deification in the sense that the ancient Roman emperors claimed to be gods.

But theosis is deification in the sense that the Christian, who empties themselves out.

Takes on

Divine attributes not infinite power and that kind of thing, but the goodness the compassion and so forth.

So you become more God like in that sense, and.

Culminating in

Talk about it subtle use of language and an interesting word. The combination of Kenosis. According to the Greek desert father's is to become ESO restos.

ISO.

You know what that means in Greek means equivalent hisoka restos is Christ equivalent.



Now I like to.

Very irreverently translate that into modern English as.

You experience what it's like to be Nano Christ.

A very, very, very miniature version of dying.

In order to be of service to others.

Your own personal version as opposed to the cosmic version, which is I think that would be the.

The Mega Christ OK, OK, so kenosis.



So now we've got Islam Judaism, Christianity, the western religions. Let's go to.

Buddhism.

So.

Just to put it in an index script for the fun of it.

This is Devanagari, which is the North Indian alphabet used to write Sanskrit Hindi and such but I just wrote a Poly word.

In it, and uh to.

ANATTA.

And this is the famous doctrine of the put out no self as thing.

That gets translated into various Asian languages.

Let's start with.

Tibetan.





Screw that up.

That's how you do it.

Not pretty.

Tibetan it's called document or dominant.

If you romanize it.

BDAG.

Dot Med.

And another dot.

Butitspronounced.net.

And it literally means self and mam beans without or not so that just directly translates.

In.

E Asia,

You got.

Chinese characters as the classical language.

So that's how you write it.

And it exactly corresponds.

Now there's 4 cultures that constitute the.

The sphere of the influence of Chinese characters.

Traditionally, those 4 cultures are of course, China itself.

Vietnam.

Korea and Japan, so there's local pronunciations for this.

Uh let's go down the list in.

Mandarin Chinese.

It would be pronounced.

Woo all.

Womans not existent or does does not exist and war is self so that's exactly like doc bag and Tibetan.

In Vietnamese pronunciation.

Same characters are pronounced.

Volner.

Vietnamese has a very peculiar creaky tone unique to it, Wagner.

You can hear the tones right Vietnamese and Chinese are both tonal languages, so in Mandarin Chinese. It's a rising tone and then a dipping tone wall.

And in Vietnamese you can hear similar Huh Voma.

Well let's write it in Korean Script Koreans have their own alphabet.

I could be wrong about this my Korean is very rusty, but I'm pretty I think it's moohah.

MUA.

But I know for sure what it is in Japanese.

Similar sounding.

Japanese also have their own silver, Berry Kana Muga Mu GA.

The Dow list also had a term for the nothingness of the liberated person.

It's another Chinese word meaning emptiness actually.

This character here.

Which is pronounced she?

And that's sort of the Taoist equivalent.

So, there, we have.

Sort of the world of.

The humility to the vanishing point.

Uh as cultivated in the Western and eastern traditions.
