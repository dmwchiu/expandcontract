Yes, in terms of simultaneous expansion and contraction something that I realized just in the last day or 2. I kind of noted how much I was appreciating.

Something that used to be disturbing with as soon as something arises. It has begun to pass away. Anne I was appreciating that and I was appreciating the.



Space it creates and how.



Holding on to something doesn't even occur.

When you're

Working with that and then I switched to the teacher mind and thought OK? What's a fun game and I can create they help. People just kind of touching on that and I remembered.

Noting gone.

With.

Quick sounds like the Peacock through the woman with the high heels or the cop ticking an I had mentioned before how it reminded me of? When I was in high school and had a Ford Pinto and with 1500 miles away from home and I had to drive long distances and had no money and I learned to get behind trucks, there was this little party object and what is it draft or say an I an I could go forever without using it and gasket there was like this magic space by my truck. Well, it's not because it's dangerous you shouldn't be doing it, but uh.

This is so cool and it's like there was this magic space behind the trucks where you got a free ride and I started thinking of every little 'cause. Usually, when arising happens. We turn and look at it and then it's gone before we, we jump to the arising and we missed the gun and then the next one comes and I got to where I was thinking. A Verizon's as each having this magic space behind them. Where you get a free ride cool.

That's a great you know, and so every time something arose. I go free right pre right and and it helped me not solidify on the arising.

And I was just thinking of that as we today as we were doing this in as I was do I did that as our middle thing, and I thought Oh that might be a fun game to help. People just get a taste of not attaching to the solidity of the arising.



As we

As we say in the industry can I use no he didn't come back.

Oh, that's great free ride OK.

The life may not be a free lunch.
