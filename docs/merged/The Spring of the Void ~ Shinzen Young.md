Uh.

So what prompted me to bring up that koan was.

This little fellow here OK because I can't think of a better iconic representation of enlightenment than this OK, there, we go.

Yeah, it's fun isn't it, it is fun. Why is it fun? Why do we don't like watching this there is a reason and it's called Helmholtz free energy?

I'm reasonably sure.

I would say that.

We all.

Ride.

On.

A kind of effortless.

Just happening nahs.

That is the nature of consciousness so.

When I say the word emptiness.

Within say the Buddhist context.

What image comes to your mind?

Well, maybe an image of vastness.

I would say that's not incorrect, but it's exactly half the picture.

I think for a lot of People when they hear Buddhists talk about emptiness. The image that comes to their mind is some sort of.

Oh.

Some sort of Bleakness.

It's like.

You bust your buns for 40 years on the cushion and what do you have to show for it emptiness?

Maybe that's another rabbi in Rochie joke the road, she says. We we attain emptiness Rabbi says.

That's Garmisch OK, you have to know your dish garnished means means Bob 'cause. It means that once that's nothing OK. OK, however, when I when I first encountered the word emptiness I was.

A student of Buddhism academically.

Company in Tibetan shown Italian Sanskrit Cone in Mandarin Chinese cool and sino Japanese I knew it in many Asian languages.

It was just as weird idea that I didn't have any image of it's like what the heck.

As I say a lot of People probably think of Bleakness.

So People think of vastness.

But the reason I so like this little charge for that Charlie brought is.

For many, many years.

Um.

Now, when I use the word emptiness and when I hear the word emptiness within the Buddhist context.

This is exactly what my images bouncing us springiness.

Um.

In 1660, Robert Boyle wrote foundational work.

Uh.

On pressure and the year later, you wrote a foundational work on chemistry, which it it's interesting Lee. He called the skeptical chemist.

It was a scathing critique of Aristotelian an paracelsian alchemy, essentially and is thought of as the beginning of modern chemistry.

But the year before he wrote that he wrote something that was subtitled that I just loved the title of this.



Touching the spring of the air.

That's how the back in those days talked about pressure is like you know it's like the springiness of the air touching the spring of the air.

And.

That is.

What the experience of emptiness is for me as a meditative experience it's directly touching the spring?

Of.

The void.

And so I just mentioned this something to know about.
