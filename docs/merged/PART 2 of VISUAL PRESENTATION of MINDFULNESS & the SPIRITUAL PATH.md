OK.

So.

Those are my threatened amas by 3:00 utterances.

Now.

I'm going to put them all together in one diagram.

And that diagram Furthermore is going to show you how to store and retrieve.

Everything I have ever taught you in Essence.

To put it on one page.

So that's a lot of information and a lot of relationships between information.

So I'm going to give you information.

Info and the info is about mindfulness.



Info.

Some of the info is basic.



The basic info answers.

5 questions.

What is mindfulness?

You already know right.

Why practice wine fullness?

You already know I showed you.

At least 1 Formulation How do you develop mindfulness?

We just covered that too OK that was the first utterance now wasn't it right.

What what is mine from us I showed you the 3 sides etc etc?

Then there's the question of where is mindfulness?



And there is the question of? When is web? When did mindfulness developed well the when of mindfulness it's still developing and that's the utterance? I just made with the shamanism meditation. Historical is the pre history. The history, the present and possible future so that's the wind, you already know that.

The where you also know it's the human condition, so you already know the answers.

To these 5 basic questions? What is it concentration clarity equanimity wide practice it.

Or sides of human happiness? How do you practice it? Give me techniques you need day-to-day practice here to your practice?

Try to make it fun. When did it develop? Well, it's still developing and where is it applied it it's applied to the human condition?

And.

So that's the bait sort of the basic information.

And then some of the information, I'm going to give you.

Is?

Details.

Detailed information.

Details about

The Watt.

For each of concentration clarity and equanimity.

The details are.

What it is what it isn't?

An example from your life learning how to evoke examples from other peoples lives. There's a superficial view and a deep view for for each of the skills and you've heard me talk about that. If not at this retreat other retreats. So we've got detail about the Watt. The detail about the why we talked about last night.

Here are the basic formula.

As you'll recall.

Is?

Mindful awareness.

Leads to

6 factors.

That constitute

Let's just say it's for you.

This is the happy pointing to you.

On.

There's 6 things that are thought of as being whoops. Let's do it surface 1st.

Surface or ordinary human happiness.

And remember it was get pleasure in the body avoid discomfort in the body.

Get various answers in the mind avoid don't know mind.

In the mind get situations that you want.

And avoid situations that you don't want OK.

This ordinary happiness plus deep happiness.

For yourself.

Deep happiness you remember the difference, OK here, you want fulfillment.

Here you want to you want to elevate fulfillment you want to avoid suffering.

You want to get the answer.

And you want to be able to experience don't know mind.

As an OK thing.

And then here instead of situations its behavior.

You want to manage. I love cause and effect positive behavior cut down on negative object to behavior those of the object effectors ease of the sensors factors.

This.

Leads to a motivation.

To help other People and I mentioned why that is, and what form that takes so this is a love of the human condition.



What I drew there?

It was a heart and this is the Chinese character for humanity.

This is bodhichitta.



This leads to bodhicitta in the Buddhist context.

Which then leads you?

To spread surface and deep happiness to others.

And all of this, this plus this.

And this.



Equals total human happiness.

It's this plus this it's not just.

Of learning how to get fulfillment. It's also getting pleasure is not just avoiding suffering. It's also avoiding discomfort is not just getting enlightenment answers. It's getting this too.

These together the situations you want.

So this plus this leading to this.

Leading to this.

You'll have to have happy in every way.



So that's details about happiness. Then there's you already know all the details about.

The practice because it's on the game boards that we've been going over and over and over. That's where the details on that are so I said, Do you have basic information?

You'd have detailed information.

You're going to also have.

Deep information there's certain deeper things.

Specifically, about the how you remember that, we talked about the deep game of mindfulness. The interplay of work with the parts work with the whole make make separate make distinctions make unifications active stance versus passive stance. Mutual complementarity of self and no self. That's sort of the deep game of how.

And then there's the deep where.

We talked about this, I won't go into the details but the forces that mold.

Are sensory experience?

Uh.

This surface forces of Inter activation versus outer that expensive contractive poll. The mundane expansion and contraction and then the deep pure spirit. Spatial spread and collapse or in the paradigm of early Buddhism. The spontaneous rising and simultaneous passing when viewed from a temporal paradigm. These are the deep view of where.

That's our sensory experience that's the board in between this of time space and our sensory experience that inhabits it.

So that's a deep perspective. I'm going to give you deep information and then I'm going to give you broad information just for the fun of it.

A broad context of the whole universe.

Gotta look at where these themes sort of fit in with what's known about.

The natural world, broad.

So.

These are the kinds of information, I'm going to give you so we need a a nice storage bin for this. Hopefully one that sort of looks pretty but also is intuitive so you'll know where information is.

So.

We're going to have a basic box. Uh now let's not call it that let's call it the center square.

And that a place in Boston.

Center Square Park Central Square. Sorry.

Will call this central square and Central Square is going to store information about?

The Watt and where and when and how all the basic stuff is in central square.

Now the details about the what is mindfulness?

We're going to store in.

3 boxes over here and the details about why practice it. We're going to store up here.

And the details about how to practice it. We're going to store down over here.

And then down here we're gonna make 3.

Yin Yang type shapes.

Just because they're pretty.

But they'll also contains some information sort of interesting.

So this then suggests that we could make a line here and a line here and the line here Anna line here.

And make this into a nice little Octagon.

So the details are in the Octagon and that deep stuff is going to be in the center in the second Octagon. So we're going to draw panel here. That's going to store deep well. We're going to draw panel here. This is going to store deep information the deep game of how.

This panel here is going to start deep information about the where.

This panel here.

And this panel here.

And then these circles here.

Are going to store?

Broad information.

About the whole universe.

Where in we will see the themes of expansion and contraction played out?

So that suggests that we could sort of do something like this, this like this.

And we have a second nice little after gone.



Yeah, and we've got this nights gonna be like this OK and this and this and this.

So see the general pattern here, OK your basic answers are here details here.



Deep use here and then we're going to see the whole arc.

Of the physical world.

From galaxies to atoms.

This point here.

So get the general idea of how we're going to store information. It looks like Amanda lot very much doesn't, it in fact, Mondal's have many levels of meaning one of them is that they're actually a Palace of God that you're looking from a bird's eye view and so there's 4 gates.

Yes, it's very much like among the law this is a.

This is a

Cosmo gram.

It's a picture of the universe.

It's a psychogram it's a picture of consciousness.

It is hold a gram.

A picture of the path.

And it's an idio graph ID IO, not IDEO.

IDEO Adarrial Gram in that sense, is like a Chinese character ID. IO gram is. That means a video means personal or private. It's a picture of my mind.

It's an idiosyncratic psychogram.

I'm sorry, it's different from the rest of it.

Um.

But the joke Oh I see.



I failed the koan.



So.

Now here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to show you the actual thing. I'm going to turn this board around they're going to see the giant thing, but I'm warning you that, even though it's pretty big. You can't make out the details because all by the way all the information.

Is stored in hieroglyphics?

Which you've seen all of 'em?

OK, during this 2 weeks, but you can't see them from where you're sitting.

But you will be able to see them from the sheet that I'm going to pass out to you.

And then you'll be able to follow everything so I probably need some help twisting this around.













Roma.







It's pretty isn't it now like I say you can't see the symbols from where you are even if you have a good vision, but.

An and then pass out something that you can look at but.

Here it is.

Here is your senses.

Write your conduct.

A life treats you.

And the answer to the question what is mindfulness concentration clarity equanimity?

Why practice mindful us total human happiness?

What's in? How do you practice mindfulness techniques?

Daily cycle yearly cycle daily cycle have a good time. What's the history of mindfulness show monic. Prius prehistoric show monic origins, historic meditative traditions? Present research, possibly new Donovan New Age.

Uh.

This is the basics what why where where now the details details on Watt.



What is concentration?

Well, I've given all the lectures. I'm not going to go into it. But you know, there's is what it is what it is it instances, the deep view and the taste and the same information for sensory clarity and the same information for equanimity details notice. It lines up 1:00 to 1:00 details about this you store here.

Details about this There's the noting board.

There's the focus on positive board iconographically represented positive affect is smiling positive behaviors legs positive. Cognition is a brain ideal or archetype is holy figure positive situation is a dawn similar to this, but then this is other and you could do it in the visual auditory somatic. We don't show the do nothing bored 'cause it's nothing.

And this box tells you the four kinds of information you can extract from these boxes their strategies for formal practice their ways of classifying cutting up the pie of sensory experience their ways of formulate of figuring out applications for certain jobs in the world? How can I deal with this? How can I do deal with that you can formulate your strategies at your tool kit and also it gives you a detail view of the history.

That's a a sundial you remember that, we went through this whole thing and we outlined the whole history of world contemplation based on these categories, so these are the four types of information you can extract from the game boards.

Uh.

So details about this.

Details about this.

What up here details about Mister Happy Head?

OK.

What surface happiness?

Avoiding pain getting pleasure, avoiding pain? What's deep happiness experiencing pleasure times, mindfulness and what's instead of avoiding pain, you can experience pain, divided by mindfulness, reducing suffering?

What does the mind want it want stuff to shine it's light on all these different problems but what does it really want to shine it's light?

And the socket that it's connected to what you think you want is to avoid.

Don't know mine, but what you really want is to be able to experience don't remind us and empowerment. But what you think you want, which is valid is good situations, sunny weather. Not bad weather. But what you really want because it leads to these things is positive behavior.

So if you get this for yourself, you're going to be very happy. You asked me what's the definition of enlightenment, so this is a figure with a :) but the outline is very diffuse. There's no separation between inside and outside no thingness to separate.

And our consequences of that is that you want to serve you want to serve materially. You want to serve by this is a mouth teaching mindfulness mouth, not fit you give Donna you support those that serve materially and you support those who teach so this gives you more information about this now, let's go deep.

This is deep this is basics.

Detail detail detail this is just for decoration, but it's sort of cool because this reminds us that our sensory experiences again young thing.

And we see that in detail over here.

This reminds us that our path our techniques at a deep level arise through an interplay. Maybe not exactly in young but there's a little expensive contract. If so this reminds us of the deep view over here. This is practice. This is the deep view of practice. The interplay of active versus passive work with the parts work with the whole make discriminations bright discriminations.

Manifest itself.

Go into the Nosa.

So this is.

This is the sort of the yen. Yang, the inner game of practices here and the sort of yin. Yang of sensory experience. The basic molding forces. The tug of subjective versus object if activation. The surface manifestations of expansion and contraction. The deep manifestations of expansion and contraction and the effortless activity of time itself rising and passing simultaneously.

These are the forces superficial and deep that mold sensory experience, so this.

This is this is the doorway to the deep view on this. This is the doorway to the deep view on this and this is the doorway to the deep view on the universe.

Displayed here.

The.

The title of the universe is.



Omega.

Which is that like that related to the cosmological constant it's big it's the number it's the interplay of expansion and contraction that molds the universe as a whole. Then the universe is at the finer scale. The smallest times smaller spatial scale is the plank and then this thing with the dot. This Sir component represents all the structures that arise in between the universe as a whole.

And the Planck scale the cosmic space scale and they plunk spatial scale. There's all these structures. That sort of seem to reflect a contract if Corrine expensive cloud or something along those lines and what are they galaxies supermassive black hole in the center effusive cloud of stars sons? We talked about it or an in between the expansion of thermal photon pressure in the contraction of self gravity.

Planets.

Core mantle atmosphere interactions cause the in and out of the core and mantle cause surface continents to flow. The rising and falling of thermal currents caused the weather to flow.

On the human being anatomically.

Scott it's got nerves that input this process in the brain.

Motor goes out.

Heart.

And the Kappel Aries, it's an expansion contraction thing, we have a similar kind of structure and in our complicated of all creatures. We are the ones that are most aware of the input output in terms of cause and effect. So we live very much in that world. Also, the cell. I gave a whole talk about how this cell is formed by lipid bilayer.

OK, with the with a polar ends sticking out into the watery environment on the outside of the watery environment on the inside.

Creating an inside outside situation, then macro molecules like proteins with nonpolar core.

And surrounded by polar atoms are polar radicals. And So what did those polar radicals do well. They can migrate into this membrane and start to create very complex interactions that are input output of energy and matter and information into the cell.

That same sort of deal contractive core surrounded by this Halo and then atoms look very much in some ways like galaxies and at the base of it.

Is the mathematics?

The operations of mathematics.

Which all have the same basic structure just different flavor? It's an intertwining of 3 kinds of polarizing and canceling activities. You have movement you have you have?

Step forward step back, don't move you have stretch out pull in.

Don't move you have world this way world that way don't move.

All the movements of the dancer.

Are represented by the mathematics and?

Therefore the

The fact that the mathematics seems to have this polarization cancellation type of situation.

Shouldn't surprise us because we've discovered it in our own sensory experience seems to be something very fundamental about the way so it's sort of at the base of what models all of this there was a famous file famous bio mathematician named how Dane HALDNE as an Englishman and this was back and I guess the Victorian Oregon.

Guardian period. Maybe not quite that old, but back there early 19th century, he was active someone once asked him.

Based on his study of mathematics and biology had, he been able to discern any characteristics of the creator.

Could you say anything about God's personality based on his development of this field of biomathematics and you said yes as far as I can see the main characteristic of God is that he has an inordinate fondness for beetles, but actually I would paraphrase how they?

I think God has an inordinate.

Fondness for

Contrast and cancellation.

That seems to be the pattern.

Let me see very broadly.

And that is everything important that I know.

I hate you.

Google.
