OK.

So.





The human condition.

Humanity in general.

Each one of us in specific.

Can be iconically represented?

This way.

So a lot of information stored in this.

As far as I can see everything that significant.

For an individual or us collectively is iconically represented here.

So what you do is you draw circle and then you draw 2, intersecting triangles. They draw couple more circles in a dot and then we're going to make this into life scene.

Spiritual life.

Found 6 compartments.

Then you drawn IEYE.

See.

Here feel the three cents modalities.

On.

There is inner activation.

For each one of these.

CN.

CN right here that's your mental images.

Here in this is your mental talk feeling. This is your emotional body. But there's also the physical senses see out the physical world here.

Here out.

Hear the sounds of the world feel out the physical impact of your quality.

So you have the inner and outer visual somatic an auditory arisings. These are set are set are ordinary sensory experiences that create the sense of self on the inside and physical world on the outside and then from the viewpoint of site cycle spiritual growth. There are certain special states that are significant restful states.

And there's visual auditory in somatic rest.

Flow states.

Visual auditory somatic flow and within the subjective activation there is.

A particular proper subset.

Of positive images positive mental talk and pleasant positive emotions the subset of our inner activation that relates to our human goodness is very important so that's positive.

Also see here feel in out rest flow.

Good.



To go.





2 are the 2 sides of the spiritual source and go or gone is.

The.

Uh what happens when those 2 sides to come together and you have to get a complete source. But when there's complete source.

There's no cell for the world, so the source breaks apart and in the cleft is born. The self and world at least as we experience it sensorially here.

Jewish mysticism has a whole thing about simple soon.

How has said and grew up the allowing half of God and the limiting half of God?

Pull apart and create this cleft.

Where in the world of Rise is very, very interesting.

Paradigm and something we can actually experience.

So.

They add this is the world of sensory experience.

Beyond the image is the mental talk and the emotional body beneath it.

Is the Subs are subconscious mind?

Which is as far as I can tell avast world of connectivity?

Uh.

Now in the object if world we have behaviors indicated by Little Feat.

Probably walk.

And they basically come in 3 flavors good behavior bad behavior on.

Ethically neutral behavior this tends to be linked with three object if situations in the world.

Desirable situations undesirable situations and sort of neutral situation so this is the law of Karma.

I don't know that it's exact accountancy across lifetimes, but

Certainly, there are 10 general tendencies what goes around comes in.

And I think it's important to?

Be aware that actions have consequences.



Beyond our personal world of our personal behaviors and our personal situations is the real world.

Whatever that is.

Not sure I can give you a conjecture what the real world is I'm sorry do it well. But it's just my conjecture. This I know for sure. I have absolute confidence that this works, the way it works.

But this is the world of sensory experience.

The real world.

In my conjecture is sort of like the subconscious it's a vast realm of connectivity.

And you can certainly in your meditation practice get the sense that when this collapses.

The Inner World of connectivity in the outer world with connectivity merge.

Uh that's a whole other paradigm for enlightenment.

Each immense sons there.

Can you see it Phillip?



Whoops.

Yunnan's son, Chan.

One line moment contains 10th contains 3000 worlds.

Actually, 3000.

1000 World Systems.

OK, so that's uh that's the tent. I in China. Whole other paradigm for enlightenment completely unknown in the West died out in China 2000 years ago.

But someone had an enlightenment based on the experience of this merging with this and another guy also the audience cool very similar notion.

YN is it has influenced the modern Vietnamese master ticket hot.

When he talks about intervening that's that's directly from the lion in tradition and that's based on an appreciation of the similarity between these 2 things.

But anyway that's a whole other deal.

I like to work here.

When you want to help someone.

This is also useful to keep in mind.

How do you help someone?

Well, if you want to get a sense of their whole situation.

Now you may not be able to do something about a lot of their situation. But it's useful. I think they have a sense of the whole situation.

So when I am in a position to help someone.

I figure out what their sensory challenges are like maybe they have pain OK and they have. But I know if they have physical pain is an issue, then I know that they probably have image talk and emotional reactions to that.

So they've got a sort of sensor challenge, but I also think about well are their behavior changes. They need to make is there something that they need to change about their object if situation impossible, etc, etc. So I use this as a sort of matrix to remind me how to organize a plan plan to help that person improve their life.

So I think of the sensory challenges. I think of the behavioral challenges. I think of the situational challenges and then I think of the various mindfulness approaches the focus options that can work with those.

Uh and

So that gives me a framework for.

Suggesting.

Treatment plant so to speak so.

Let's look at what that treatment plan is in the most general framework.

In the most general framework.

We could say that the goal of mindfulness practice is total human happiness.

And I have an icon for that is a square Smiley space. :)

So.

In order to understand total human happiness.

We have to understand.

Surface happiness and we have to understand what I call deep happiness.

Now totally human happiness consists of surface happiness for yourself.

Deep happiness for yourself.

Helping others to achieve surface happiness.

And helping others to achieve the packages if you're doing all four of those then or in some way.

All fostering all four of those then I say you are experiencing total or complete human happiness.

Now what most People call happiness.

Is what I would call surface happiness for themselves?

If you ask most People, you know what's what will make you happy.

They'll talk about something that comes under uh it's only a very small part of what I would call a happiness. It's legitimate but I would call it surface happiness for the individual.

And here is surface happiness for the individual represented iconically.

So this is what People think they want.

And, which they actually do want and legitimately.

It's legitimate to watch all this.

But what People really want is over here and it's sort of related this is deep happiness.

And when you have if you can have what you think you want and what you really want then you personally are very happy.

But not totally happy because.

When you have what you really want as you'll see in a minute. You realize that it's related to what I was saying before you realize that you is cleaner than just one line and body, so OK.

With respect to the bottom.

Well, no actually let's start down here. Yes, the average person.

What's happiness for you they're going to probably answer in this domain and I gotta probably answer.

Down here.

So this is like the sun's coming up right and this is like rain and lightning and bad weather. So most People are going to give you circumstances object if conditions that OK if I have. This this and this. I'm going to be happy and they got a name. Perhaps some objective conditions which if I can avoid this in this then I'll also be happy. So I have the job. I want by the relationship. I want I have the health situation. I want I have the financial situation of along.

The right People are in power in the government where I live, etc, etc. These are all conditions and then I'll be happy.

Also, we want to elevate sort of the shiny weather and I am able to avoid health problems that I'm able to avoid financial problems and the people in my life are not behaving in a way that I dislike etc. Etc then I'll be happy. Thank you get the general idea, it's a litany of.

Remember our picture of the human condition, it's a litany of this.

I want these good situations. I want to avoid these bad situation.

So that's what most People will call happiness. But if you look a little more deeply.

Object if situations.

The reason they make us happiest because of sensory experiences.

If I

And as a success in a way that I want to be a success.

What does that really mean that means I get to have the pleasant sensations of People telling me how great I am?

A lot I know I'm going to have that day after day OK, so knowing that every time I think that thought that's a mental image. Anna mental talk and then I get a Smiley sensation that every time. Somebody tells me how great I am I get a Smiley sensation. So the reason I want to be a success is so that I can have certain pleasant emotional sensations. In my body on demand. A lot of the time anytime. I want to think a certain thought it feels good in my body, etc, etc.

So really in the end situations.

Are desirable because they get their desirable if they give us certain sensory experience in their undesirable if they give us?

And opposite sensory experience, So what is the body think it wants it thinks it wants to elevate pleasant physical sensations and pleasant emotional sensations and it does.

And that's fine and what it wants to avoid is unpleasant physical an unpleasant emotional sensation.

What does the mind want the line wants answers to this or that?

And it wants to avoid don't know.

So that's all good.

But what does the body really want?

Something like pleasure, but suddenly different I call it fulfillment or satisfaction.

What is it?

It's pleasure multiplied by concentration clarity and equanimity. It's the degree to which the body has been trained to have complete experience of pleasure or a mindful experience of pleasure. Those 2 phrases mean exactly the same thing in my way of thinking so we think we want intensity variety of duration of pleasure, physical and emotional in the body that's

And we do want that but we really what we really want is satisfaction from that pleasure and that turns out to be not just a function of the pleasure, but a function of mindful awareness.

We think we want to avoid discomfort in the body and that's true and legitimate but what we really want is to avoid suffering.

And it turns out that physical or emotional discomfort.

Uh.

Is?

Only what turns it into suffering is lack of mindfulness, so fulfillment equals pleasure multiplied by mindful awareness.

And suffering equals disk equals discomfort.

Uh.

Divided by mindful awareness so as the as the mindful awareness gets smaller the suffering is larger.

Uh.

OK.

What the mind?

On the surface wants is answers to a lot of things on the outside.

What the mind?

In the deep sense wants is.

The ants the answer.

What am I seeing here clear the light beams are pointing to lots of things on the outside here the light is shining back on its own origin.

Seeing what it's always been plugged into.

This is called enlightenment.

Or wisdom.

And actually what we need to avoid is not so much don't know mind. In fact, we can't avoid over the line sooner or later? Don't know mind gets us.

First of all every answer that you get generates 10 new questions. You never thought about that, so the answers grow linear, but they don't know grows exponentially.



So that's number one number 2.

Contrary to what every mathematician and scientist would have ever thought in the past.

It turns out that modern math and modern science.



Have at their core.

A tremendous appreciation of limits as to what can be known.

Heisenberg uncertainty in physics.

Google incompleteness and undecidability in mathematics don't know moves large in modern science and then.

An important plays an important role.

Uh.

Thirdly.

Sooner or later.

We're going to get old and stupid.

All of us were going to be faced with don't know.



So it's good to realize that.

Don't know doesn't have to be a problem.

See here's like.

Chaos confusion doubt in decision and a frown OK. This is, don't know as a problem conditional happinesses.

Or surface happiness comes about when we can reduce don't know itself.

But it turns out that unconditional hours deep happiness is related to the elevation or increase of an experience of don't know with a smile.

Don't know with a smile.

Is a meaningful is the meaningful experience of meaninglessness?

That sounds oxymoronic, meaning contradictory in and of itself.

Maybe sounds like just some sort of word game, but there is such a thing as a meaningful experience of meaningless nuts.

And actually it comes about when you have a sensorially clear concentrated Annie quantumness experience of confusion doubt indecision and chaos.

Then that experience actually starts to taste like?

Something.

That has meaning because you're working through the need to know.

And that leads to a new kind of noise.

So, in mindfulness practice you get the insights by observing.

Careful observing and analysis.

But in, then practice for example, at least Rinzai Zen.

There is a certain amount of observing that's true but also there's this what they call koan practice. You're given a problem that you cannot solve intellectually but then your press press to solve it.

But you can't and you're thrust into.

Are continuous don't know mind state?

Which at some point you stop fighting?

And then a new kind of knowing starts to flow through you.

So deep happiness is the experience of don't know how and empowering way.

So you see the contrast.

Get pleasure.

Versus get fulfillment, which is a function of mindfulness.

Avoid discomfort versus avoid suffering.

A function of mindfulness.

Then, answers to this, or that.

By way of contrast get the answer well this is a function of mindfulness.

Avoid don't know mine.

Learn to experience don't know mine does and empowerment well. This is a function of my phones.

On.

Object now here's the object if world in surface happiness.

That certain conditions avoid other conditions.

The object if world in deep happiness is.

Once objected behavior.

The The Surface Happiness POV is I want this, I want to avoid this.

The deep happiness point of view is well if I can improve this and avoid this unlikely to get this.

So it's putting first things 1st.

But how does mindfulness way in?

Well, if situations are to a certain extent. I don't claim 100%. I think chance enters in probably don't know for sure. But in general, if circumstances are consequences of behavior.

If we have a handle on our behavior with time on average is likely we're going to get the circumstances we want.

However.

Our behaviors are driven by our sensory experiences are mental image. Our mental talk are physical and emotional sensations drive our behavior. Mindfulness gives us a handle on beyond our sensory experience that gives us a handle on our behaviors.

That tends to lead to.

Surface happiness.

And besides concentration and clarity and equanimity not only bring about wisdom mind. They also increase your normal IQ. I do not have a scintilla of doubt that my late 60s.

Now I am.

Incomparably smarter than I was in my 20s.

Just smarter in the sense of regular old intellectual smarts.

Why did I get smarter and smarter because of meditation?

So mindfulness effects IQ.

Uh I believe.

Um.

So it actually helps with this one.

And you know if you have sensory clarity that can also help you solve problems etc.

You make positive behavior changes Well, you're likely to have more health.

And less physical problems, etc etc.

So consequence of this these 2 can go up so mindfulness also has an impact on our surface happiness. I don't mean to dis surface happiness by calling calling in surface it has a role.

Uh.

So we want to get both so we want to increase positive behaviors. We want to decrease negative personal behaviors.

That's the object if peace.

In deep happiness.

So.

I should say, however, that mindful awareness skills alone may not be enough.

To achieve behavioral changes there, they are very helpful.

But you may need an awesome sort of object if accountability structure, like a 12 step program therapist. What have you for behavior change? In addition to the mindful awareness they potentiate each other?

So that's

Sort of what these symbols mean?
