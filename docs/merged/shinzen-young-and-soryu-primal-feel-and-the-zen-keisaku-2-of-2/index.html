Oh.</p>
<p>Has decided that he is sick of me perverting the true teachings of Zen?</p>
<p>By mixing it with the personal.</p>
<p>And also my cavalier and arrogant attitude.</p>
<p>Claiming that there have never been any good meditation teachers.</p>
<p>Although there have been and are great ones needs to be chastised in public.</p>
<p>Didn't expect that issue?</p>
<p>So we're going to show you how it's done and he's good at it.</p>
<p>And he's like a profession, I don't know if you know, but he's like arguably the best tennis player in Vermont. He's a professional athlete and he's young and he's strong, he might break it.</p>
<p>OK, so.</p>
<p>Would you like to say anything? Why don't you come up here and tell your case awkward stories?</p>
<p>I actually went through a similar.</p>
<p>Experience so I don't have very much new to say, yeah, I went.</p>
<p>Into the temple.</p>
<p>And for the 1st.</p>
<p>Period of time that case, I could actually seemed.</p>
<p>Maybe this isn't the same it seemed kind of fun.</p>
<p>I was I was young and.</p>
<p>Felt very tough.</p>
<p>Stuff and I was good at meditation and all this and I liked it that I was in a tough place with People who had hit me and.</p>
<p>And it was kind of fun and there came a.</p>
<p>A point when.</p>
<p>Which I actually talked about earlier today? When I started to notice how distracted I actually was I'd never noticed because I was too distracted to notice. TS Eliot distraction distraction by distraction so I was distracted.</p>
<p>To the point that I?</p>
<p>Sometimes believed that when I was thinking. I'm pretty good at this and not noticing that I was distracted from my meditation. When I was thinking how good I was at the meditation.</p>
<p>And there came a very.</p>
<p>Horrifying really transformation when I notice that I actually couldn't keep my concentration in my estimation at that point for even.</p>
<p>1 second couldn't keep my mind on anything for a second and I started to have a great deal of insecurity and it was really at that point when the keisaku turned into something horrifying.</p>
<p>And then the person would carry the case acuin at least for me. The self talk was all negative about them. What's this terrible person doing trying to hurt us and?</p>
<p>Wreck this monastery with violence and all of that.</p>
<p>And it was, it was really quite awhile before I managed to work through that in a similar way, though.</p>
<p>Horado Roshi actually began to regularly carry it for a long sit. He would carry it very slowly through the Zendo and it was that presents that it really felt as he moved it.</p>
<p>You mentioned that wave it was, it was like it was there was just a force of such enerji penetrating.</p>
<p>There's penetrating my body.</p>
<p>Penetrating and in particular would penetrate my legs, which were in extreme pain early on, I decided I would only sit in full Lotus.</p>
<p>I don't know why I decided that but I decided to only sit in full Lotus and that meant that I was in extreme pain pretty much all the time.</p>
<p>Definitely the most pain I've ever experienced.</p>
<p>And as you would walk this.</p>
<p>This this sphere this like a like a son. It's like a comet. It's just like this.</p>
<p>This amazing.</p>
<p>Force of power would move and would start to kind of penetrate my body and there was so much resistance to the pain and to the.</p>
<p>Keisaku, coming that I would resist that power which made it hurt so much more and it wasn't until I really just freaked out one time as he was about to hit me.</p>
<p>It wasn't until that happened, I would I was shaking you understand just shaking just just and trying to bow like this just it was just it was just unbelievably terrible. It wasn't until a point there when it's just too much and it's just easier to not.</p>
<p>Do that anymore just easier not better not Oh good, I'll I've got a great idea. I'll stop resisting not like that. It was just I just can't anymore. Just no and so.</p>
<p>At the moment it.</p>
<p>It penetrates finally.</p>
<p>Sometimes I say it's sort of like going to the bathroom when you really have to you. Finally, just let yourself. You could finally go to the bathroom and it felt kind of like that, but just coming in and flowing through.</p>
<p>And then</p>
<p>It is uplifting it's just it's just uplifting you feel kind of like you're floating so I actually came back also to the US and I was using it. I actually haven't really used the case. I could that much here.</p>
<p>And I don't think we shouldn't. I don't. I don't think it's a good idea to make it seem as if.</p>
<p>This is sort of like you know war stories or like this is a heroic device or something. It's not it's just it's just a tool. I don't think it's I don't think that a system that uses it is has has everything going right to not use it is just great.</p>
<p>But today will show you how it's done.</p>
<p>Sorry I have to deserve it right.</p>
<p>Game face.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>So now you know, thanks are you.</p>
<p>So I</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, it's</p>
<p>Add a little Kitty.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Just good you know what's going to happen now right honestly why he charges $25.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
