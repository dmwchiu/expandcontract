Are you fixated in confusion? There's nothing wrong with being confused? In fact being confused is really good?

Coagulate Ng when you're confused.

Not good.

The goal is not to be is not to avoid confusion.

Doubt.

Disorientation the goal is not to avoid don't know.

The goal is to avoid the habitual coagulations.

Around don't know.

Une coagulative don't know.

Is called?

Spontaneity when it.

Comes out of your body?

And wisdom.

When it turns in your mind.

I repeat.

Unko angulated don't know.

Is dynamic spontaneity when it comes out of your body and wisdom? When it turns in your mind?
