<p>Sort of I am body.</p>
<p>Eh.</p>
<p>Doesn't just come about through body sensation although body sensation is primary?</p>
<p>You often hear me say subtle is significant.</p>
<p>There is typically a subtle mental picture of the outline of the body and I think that's what you're alluding to is a subtle mental picture of the outline of the body.</p>
<p>AT and then there is the body sensations. That sort of fill that picture.</p>
<p>You could think of the sensations that touch feel you could think of them as being the honey and then the body outline is the bear the container OK and the honey more or less conforms to the bear.</p>
<p>But of course, sometimes.</p>
<p>Honey is not inside that but it can be around her pod, etc, etc. So that the bear considered sometimes become more larger and spherical so I think of the?</p>
<p>Image of self the visual image of the body on and also it's often your facial expression. The clothes you're wearing all of that is, is part of it. That could be called image of body or image of self as opposed to sensations from the body.</p>
<p>Now the perception of.</p>
<p>Sort of like the bodies of thing.</p>
<p>Comes about</p>
<p>Through Nebbiolo Citian Viscosity in the body sensations.</p>
<p>And in the image of the body.</p>
<p>So as you as you sort of love if if you hate the presence of that image. Thinking Oh, this is getting in the way of a no self experience. Then you're going to be in big trouble, but if you start to love that image to death.</p>
<p>Now you're bringing clarity and equanimity and perhaps even intentionally focusing on just that image for awhile well. Guess what that's going to break up into flow the image.</p>
<p>And the sensations are going to break up into flow and the image in the sensations will become one integrated flow and that will breakdown that subtle sense.</p>
<p>That I am the body if at some point, the image is not dealt with. Let's put it that way, either dealt with consciously by being focused on or dealt with because it's just a quantum ized.</p>
<p>Quantized into fluidity even though you didn't focus on I prefer to focus on it. So I like People to learn how to work with that image have a complete experience of it work, but the sensations have a complete experience of them work with the 2:00 at the same time, and that tends to breakdown that subtle sense of self.</p>
<p>Often, there is a subtle picture of where we are the ambiance.</p>
<p>That can be worked with individually.</p>
<p>Concentrated on clarified economized until it flows.</p>
<p>When the if your eyes are closed? How do you know where you are?</p>
<p>Sound.</p>
<p>And the image of the source of the sound and the memory images of where you are.</p>
<p>If all incoming sound and the image of the ambiance are a single flow field.</p>
<p>Then you will not be limited to a certain time and place.</p>
<p>You know your</p>
<p>Location in the universe will become an fixated.</p>
<p>And so the idea is.</p>
<p>The first challenge is to.</p>
<p>Do what you just reported which is to detect that this is indeed the case. Second challenges and not to hate the presence of those subtle images because what you resist persists as far order Ehrhardt said. So you work with them and you sort of a firm them.</p>
<p>Into oblivion.</p>
<p>Counter intuitive that phraseology is and so when you get all three sort of basically.</p>
<p>You've got the self image related to the body.</p>
<p>You've got ambient imagery related to your memory or your idea about where you are, and typically triggered by sounds or enhanced by sounds then you've got the memory plan fantasy imagery that tends to be in the center of image space, which is the portal into the imogo Monday or the stored.</p>
<p>Images of</p>
<p>The world.</p>
<p>It's the surface of this giant storehouse of visual information that at its deeper deeper levels.</p>
<p>Shades into the world of myth.</p>
<p>But its surface is whatever comes up. You know quote on the mental screen is memory plan fantasy that kind of thing, so if you penetrate all 3 image locations.</p>
<p>You take care of.</p>
<p>You might say that does it work let me think.</p>
<p>Not sure what I'm going to say.</p>
<p>In terms of image.</p>
<p>I would say that the present.</p>
<p>Is a rising in those ambient images in the image of your body?</p>
<p>And then the</p>
<p>Particularly the past.</p>
<p>Is sort of in the center of image space? At least that's the portal into the stored images?</p>
<p>But as I say.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Future can also be there 'cause, you can fantasize about what could happen in the future and myth is there. The Archetypes are there at a deep level. It goes out from our world to mythological worlds potentially?</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>So each one of those locations in image space is associated with very powerful work.</p>
<p>When you do have a driana practice.</p>
<p>For this so-called visualizations, which are really.</p>
<p>Touch field image talk exercises.</p>
<p>Uh the you visualize yourself as the deity so you replace the self image with an archetype.</p>
<p>You visualize the deity in front of you facing you in the memory plan fantasy center of image space and then you replace the ambient images with Celestial Palace or Madolora Yantra or something. So you deal with that and sure enough, they hit each one of those 3.</p>
<p>And replace the ordinary with the mythological.</p>
<p>Not in order to be insane or possessed but in order to gain insight into how consciousness works our perception of.</p>
<p>Where we are, and who we are rises?</p>
<p>So it's an insight practice.</p>
<p>Now, Having said that.</p>
<p>I made it sound like.</p>
<p>Rogeriana discovered my categories, but of course, it's the other way around. I didn't figure. This out OK. I was my original training was invade Rihanna and they had us do this right and then later on, I realized well. Of course, they have us do this because this is the way.</p>
<p>Ordinary perception occurs so obviously if you're if you're playing with consciousness like Tinker toys taking things apart and put it back together. This would be the way to do it, so I got the hint on it from my training.</p>
<p>Apropos of trauma when when I have People that.</p>
<p>Have traumatic memories come up or where the IT say What do they call it a flashback?</p>
<p>Where they think they actually it's like happening now?</p>
<p>Why that's happening is that the ambient imagery? Which should reflect present reality physical reality that ambient imagery has disappeared and been replaced by the memory imagery.</p>
<p>So once you train People to detect the ambient imagery.</p>
<p>And they can see the interplay of how the present imagery starts to go away in the memory imagery occupies that location.</p>
<p>That's like hugely insightful and liberating for People.</p>
