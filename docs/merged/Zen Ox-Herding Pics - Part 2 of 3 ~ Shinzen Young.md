Taming the ox.

You.

Internalize the Enlightenment to the point where?

It.

Can't slip away from you and doesn't run wild.

OK, it follows you.

And as wonderful as that is.

That cannot be compared to.

Getting on the ox.

Actually, writing it.

This is awesome.

People are really afraid of this.

It's one thing to.

CD aux even to catch it even to sort of get it to.

Be manageable this is the ox of consciousness OK.

The some now some gal.



When it comes to writing on the Hawks that's scary.

Some of you are facing this, this stage.

If you look carefully.

You'll see.

The Arts is going this way.

You see the boy.

He's playing a flute.

Quite relaxed.

But he's looking the other way.

Is writing the ox backwards?

Do you understand?

There's no informed consent to enlightenment.

Enlightenment is better than you think it is, and not nearly what is cracked up to be?

Which one of those did you want to hear?

Both or one both or neither.

Enlightenment is like is like continually falling off a Cliff and being completely comfortable with that.

A great and powerful.

Beast carries you.

And you have to give up.

Your investment.

With where it's going.

It's the Ultimate Act of surrender writing the ox backwards.

The flow of impermanence.

You fall.

It's like falling down but you don't fall down you fall up into existence moment by moment, which is what pro teach us. Some would Potter means it's a falling but a falling up.

Without any fixation without needing to know.

What's going to happen next you simply fall into?

What needs to be done moment by moment?

So this might be called the act of true faith.

As opposed to belief.

Which is holding on to something?

Faith.

Is?

Letting go of the need to be oriented. The need to have answers. This is surrendering to the flow of expansion and contraction.

Writing writing on the wave.

Of.

The dynamic wave of nothing whatsoever, Nahs.

And letting it carry you.

So that's quite a profound active.

Faith what comes next.

The ox.

Has now carried you home he's home?

OK.

And he's completely.

At rest.

He's found final repose of the spirit.

In his home.

And the ox.

Is gone?

Only who he really was remains.



Just the person.

That.

True authentic human with no fixated position whatsoever.

And.

No more need.

For a mind as an object.

He's home.

He rode the ox home.

Complete enlightenment.

Nirvana.

But there's 3 more pictures.

What could they possibly stand for?

Well, if you read the books.

They give you various.

Explanations.

But uhm.

I was privileged to.

Discuss these pictures with a Japanese Zen Master, many years ago.

Who told me that there is an oral tradition?

About these 10 pictures.

That has not been written down.

That really it ends here.

This is complete enlightenment this is final repose.

Pictures 89 and 10 represent.

The substance.

Form.

And purpose of enlightenment.

Substance in Chinese is called T.

Which literally means?

Body.

Are the form?

Let's call Sean which is just that the form or the appearance and then what it's good for what it's used for is young and that's the application or they use.

So T Sean Young, according to this row, she's oral tradition.

The last three of these oxherding pictures.

Uh tell us.

The substance.

The appearance.

And the ultimate use of enlightenment.

So you can hardly wait right.

Substances coming up first.

What is made out of the matter?

The matter itself.



And here is the substance of enlightenment.

No substance whatsoever.

Right.

When the emperor *** Bodhi Dharma.

What is the first principle of holiness?

What did Bodhi Dharma say wide open an nothing holy?

What's the form of enlightenment?

The mountains and the Cherry Blossoms.

The ordinary appearances of the world every single thing.

Is the appearance of enlightenment?
