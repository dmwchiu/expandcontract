<p>And those metaphors are metaphors and if they help you good and if they get in the way not good.</p>
<p>One of the metaphors for equanimity is.</p>
<p>And it's standard wanted it's used by very famous and teachers.</p>
<p>You sit on the Bank of the River and we can watch it.</p>
<p>But that is just a metaphor for equanimity.</p>
<p>That's not what equanimity is.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>One of the things about the way I teach that People often find weird is I don't actually give you a home base to go back to lot of People give you the breaths like OK just keep coming back to the breath.</p>
<p>Why doesn't shinzen do that? Well, not against it totally valid way to practice but there is a reason why I don't give you a place to stand.</p>
<p>And I quote no less an authority.</p>
<p>Then one of the great enlightened Masters of China, then Jeep.</p>
<p>Who says you are with inside of every human being?</p>
<p>There is</p>
<p>An authentic person.</p>
<p>That has no position.</p>
<p>Wait drunken</p>
<p>The authentic human with no position.</p>
<p>If I were to characterize.</p>
<p>The experience of Zen practice at Mount Baldy.</p>
<p>I would say it is decentering you've heard of centering prayer that's D centering prayer.</p>
<p>Gives you know place to stand.</p>
<p>It's very disorienting.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>When you finally give up the notion that you're going to have a place.</p>
<p>To stand.</p>
<p>That's when that figure ground reversal takes voice that's when you're doing 3 dimensional's in.</p>
<p>As opposed to flat Sam which would be the Zen put down of the WAVY person is often done.</p>
<p>From a fixed perspective.</p>
<p>I'm over here.</p>
<p>Sitting on the riverbank watching the River well if that works.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>At some point you will become the River without being caught in the room if it works right.</p>
<p>But if it doesn't work right you're going to spend 20 or 30 years on the Bank of the River and never be liberated.</p>
<p>So I don't want you to have a place to stand, I want.</p>
<p>I don't want you to have a center.</p>
<p>I want the center to have you.</p>
<p>It's a completely different experience.</p>
<p>It's intentional.</p>
<p>So it is hugely not a problem.</p>
<p>If you cannot find a place to stand while you do be possible.</p>
<p>It's like hugely not a problem. It will be a problem. If you don't have some modicum of concentration clarity and equanimity.</p>
<p>But that's why I asked you. The question about the spoken labels once I determined that you had.</p>
<p>But you were doing something that I can say with confidence have salute. Lee do not try to find a place to stand in general ever.</p>
<p>And just let the place.</p>
<p>That's I don't know if you know that the very common word.</p>
<p>In Ordinary, Israeli Hebrew for God's how much com that means the place the place, but the place.</p>
<p>Find you rather than you find a place.</p>
