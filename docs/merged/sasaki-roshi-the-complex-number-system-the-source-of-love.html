<p>You may be right.</p>
<p>I only claim it's a useful way to analyze how consciousness works moment by moment.</p>
<p>He implies that it's more than that that it's a universal grand theory of everything.</p>
<p>You could have a look at everything that is in terms of.</p>
<p>A paradigm of.</p>
<p>Mutually contrast ING.</p>
<p>Activities that can cancel.</p>
<p>Into a neutral and a neutral that can polarize into mutually contrast, ING activities.</p>
<p>He says this is sort of like the way everything works.</p>
<p>It is not inconceivable that.</p>
<p>In 100 years 200 years 1000 years whenever.</p>
<p>Finally, a single unified grand theory of everything is hit upon that it turns out to have something to do with.</p>
<p>Binary contrast that can.</p>
<p>Cancel.</p>
<p>There's some hint that that might be the case because.</p>
<p>So far our best model for everything.</p>
<p>Is the complex number system?</p>
<p>Our modern concept of number.</p>
<p>And the complex number system consists of 3 types of contrast.</p>
<p>That each one of which can.</p>
<p>Neutralize.</p>
<p>To a non contrasting state.</p>
<p>There's</p>
<p>The multiplicative domain, which is a stretch squeeze thing.</p>
<p>Used red squeeze or</p>
<p>Nothing moves, which is 1 * 1.</p>
<p>Or you can multiply by a number whose absolute value is less than one that.</p>
<p>Squeeze things you could multiply it by a number of absolute value is greater than one that will stretch things.</p>
<p>If you multiply by one, it's a neutral element.</p>
<p>Then you have the additive domain where you can move to the right move to the left or not move at all, so or front back Top bottom or any direction of anything well in the complex plane. It's a 2 dimensional thing In other words, move in One Direction move oppositely in that direction. They cancel out that's.</p>
<p>Additive 0 and then there's a rotational.</p>
<p>Component in the complex numbers where you can.</p>
<p>Turn to the right turn to the left or not turn at all.</p>
<p>TS Eliot.</p>
<p>Talks about the spirit as the dance.</p>
<p>Except for the point the still point there would be no dance and there is only the damn.</p>
<p>If you look at a dancer what do they do?</p>
<p>Like Martha Graham writes stretch your arms are ring neurons in OK. This sort of stretch squeeze but they also move up or down. They jump, they moved to the right they moved to the left turn to the right turn to the left all the actions of the dancer.</p>
<p>Are actually quantified?</p>
<p>With our modern concept of number also turns out that the quantum weirdness.</p>
<p>Is in a sense of consequences of the our modern kinds of numbers the complex? What are called the complex numbers?</p>
<p>The waves that are complex waves allow for these weird things to happen among them, something coming from nothing.</p>
<p>Which is rather extraordinary?</p>
<p>But the neutral state.</p>
<p>The can be a source.</p>
<p>Of polarized something.</p>
<p>It is possible that he's right.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Who knows only time will tell.</p>
<p>But the fact that our number system seems to be built on.</p>
<p>Binary contrast that can neutralize 3 different flavors of them, actually.</p>
<p>The fact that he says consciousness is this contrast, ING neutralizing activity.</p>
<p>Could be that this?</p>
<p>Is pointing towards a grand theory of everything?</p>
<p>The whole point.</p>
<p>In experiencing</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p>Is that it's analogous to?</p>
<p>The peristalsis of a formula swoon.</p>
<p>And as you begin to experience yourself.</p>
<p>An and the world coming from this doing and returning to this doing.</p>
<p>Even though</p>
<p>The doing is impersonal and empty.</p>
<p>It's</p>
<p>Also.</p>
<p>A source of unconditional love.</p>
<p>When we contact it.</p>
<p>It has that affect on the human part of us.</p>
<p>And we naturally from that want to serve.</p>
