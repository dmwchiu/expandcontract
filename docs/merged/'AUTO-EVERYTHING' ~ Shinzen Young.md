So taken together, I have 4 standard techniques for.

Training People into what I sometimes jokingly called the Zen bounce or spontaneity or cultivating flow within your motor circuits.

So one technique is auto move an it easy way to do that. I demonstrated sort of the auto walk thing. Another technique is auto speak in an easy way to do that is like auto chant the way to cultivate spontaneous spontaneity and thought is the auto think technique. I described that briefly this actually some more details but the good news on that is, I have a very complete.

Blog in my blog spot where I talk in total detail about how to do the auto thinking technique, so that's a third technique, then often I'll use a strategy of having People work with individual elements and then having People work with the whole system so if you want to get crazy. You can auto everything. It means you try to taste your body moving while you sort of do some sort of chant.

And you're you're covering your mind space and aware of a global une fixated state there. You're doing that all together, so that would look something like this one 23456123456789 ten 156789. Ten 123456789 ten 123456789 ten 123456789 ten.

Take care.
