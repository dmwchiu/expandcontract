Harper car just something I've noticed around the wandering mind is very much related often to focus on positive, it's just that it's a It's an unconscious focus on positive. So when a person's mind is wandering in meditation and it's a problem for them.</p>
<p>Often, if they are able to detect the.</p>
<p>The pleasure component or the interest component at that point.</p>
<p>They make it conscious an it's become like a positive focus technique if they're able to actually do that so.</p>
<p>In.</p>
<p>In sharing this with students what has become very interesting is where before the wandering mind for them drove him crazy.</p>
<p>Now it's like can I catch the wandering mind when it's actually kind of an unconscious positive focus and make it into a conscious?</p>
<p>Positive focus and then they can stay with that play with it or not they can go back to their technique.</p>
<p>And so anyways, it's just become like another.</p>
<p>Window of opportunity for them. That's cool and that involves.</p>
<p>Detecting the</p>
<p>Pleasant interest flavor, absolutely, yeah, that's that's pivotal.</p>
<p>Yeah, the 3 hours my theory of what drives human attention for 3 hours.</p>
<p>Tear cheer fear other words, sadness interest and fear. I find are the basic flavors that control where our attention those and whereas at the beginning, the wandering mine is a source of suffering they can reframe it so that the wandering mind becomes turns into freedom from suffering that's really clever could I use that.</p>
<p>It can also be used.</p>
<p>If you're</p>
<p>If you're working with the do nothing technique.</p>
<p>And what often of course, prevents People from.</p>
<p>Having to do nothing technique be a quote.</p>
<p>Could experience experience?</p>
<p>So there's a way to do the do. Nothing technique where you alternate between the do. Nothing technique and the making wandering mine into a positive focus anything kind of.</p>
<p>Play with that go ahead and use that too. So we need a we need a a quick term for this thing that you're doing with the wandering mind.</p>
<p>I think I think I've come up with the name of the technique.</p>
<p>We'll call it the Happy Wanderer.</p>
