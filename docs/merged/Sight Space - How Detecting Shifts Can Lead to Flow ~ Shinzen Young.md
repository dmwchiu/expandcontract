The sources of Shiftings in visual experience.

Are several?

Obviously, if you turn your head you turn your body that causes huge shiftings and that's a source of shift.

Then you have what might be called the large scale movements of the eyes are OK like site site.

Site.

But then

There's like.

Site, but then I could be aware shift shift shift.

It like smaller movements from place to place within the object each one of those is a site too. And probably those small shifts are some combination of suck * **** movements, which are physical plus movements in in the ox in the.

In the Visual Cortex where in the brain the center of attention is shifting around even though there's not a physical basis for it and any of the ships from the gross movements of the body to the shifts that actually are not based on physical but are based on what the nervous system is doing centrali any of those scales of shift represents a new instance of visual experience and in fact that's the whole trick in getting the quote flow.

In side space is to detect the each large and small scale shift and just like the body as you become aware of how the attention shifts around starts to become undule. Taurean solve the external visual experience goes through a similar change as you're sort of with each shift like that.

I encourage People maybe you can guess what? I'm going to say now OK right do it with the glasses on so that you get you know the normal. Twenty twenty twenty but also the glasses off well. That's just a little bit like Gaza or something. It's artificial but it could be a platform to learn some stuff I myself now and in total, pixelated flow.

Now I'm also in pixelated flow, but much higher frequency.
