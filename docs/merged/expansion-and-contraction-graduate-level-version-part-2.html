<p>Of things that some of them seem related and some of them seem like completely unrelated.</p>
<p>To to each other, or to anything.</p>
<p>You'll say.</p>
<p>There is 0.</p>
<p>But 0 is intrinsically unstable.</p>
<p>Because zero consists of all positive and all negative.</p>
<p>All taken together.</p>
<p>And therefore inevitably zero breaks apart.</p>
<p>And the positive.</p>
<p>Only knows how to expand.</p>
<p>And the negative only knows how to contract.</p>
<p>Now by positive I mean?</p>
<p>Life by negative. I mean death by positive. I mean, being by negative. I mean, non being by positive. I mean, future by negative. I mean passed by positive. I mean, thus going by negative. I mean, thus coming when I positive. I mean father by negative. I mean, mother by positive. I mean, Heaven by negative. I mean, Earth by positive I mean, object if.</p>
<p>By negative I mean, subjective by positive. I mean guest by negative. I mean host by positive. I mean outside by negative. I mean, insight by positive. I mean, God by negative. I mean, the devil.</p>
<p>On.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Positives got negative is the devil positive is Father Negative, his Mother Mother is the devil is he saying that.</p>
<p>If you get caught up see if your week in abstraction if you then you'll be like completely.</p>
<p>Like weed out.</p>
<p>OK, what he's saying is that?</p>
<p>Oh, and many says success failure affirmation negation praise blame.</p>
<p>Can you see?</p>
<p>What the teaching is what he's trying to point out to People? Maybe not weaken abstraction you're too caught up in the literal meanings of these words.</p>
<p>Rather than the poetry.</p>
<p>Then is a powerful poem.</p>
<p>The person on the other hand, should be a carefully crafted essay then People don't say enough.</p>
<p>We'll be passing the teachers say too much.</p>
<p>But hopefully they'll be somewhere in between all these faulty teachings.</p>
<p>Someone will get something of benefit.</p>
<p>In between born in between.</p>
<p>Boy is that an interesting theme.</p>
<p>All of mathematics could in some way or much of mathematics could be described.</p>
<p>As.</p>
<p>The study of what is born in between?</p>
<p>Were born in between?</p>
<p>Our remote ancestors.</p>
<p>4 of us is born in between father Sky and mother Earth.</p>
<p>E Asian flower arranging Japanese flower arranging is based on.</p>
<p>There's a Sky principle and Earth principle and in between is the human principle. There's always those 3 levels represented in the Flowers.</p>
<p>So we're born in between moment by moment.</p>
<p>In between what might be called fundamental flow.</p>
<p>If you want to get to the stillness the absolute stillness the still point of the turning world.</p>
<p>Neither movement from North Taurids paradoxically.</p>
<p>One way to get there, there must be many, many ways to get there.</p>
<p>I would never say there's only one way to get there, but one way to get there. The way I'm familiar with is the paradoxical way.</p>
<p>My utterly surrendering to movement from an movement towards.</p>
<p>Or any antipodal.</p>
<p>Pair of activities of nature.</p>
<p>By utterly surrendering.</p>
<p>To either one the other or preferably both at the same time, if you can the something nahs.</p>
<p>Within is literally torn apart, Sasaki Roshi is very politically incorrect as a teacher.</p>
<p>He says things and I have to translate them that.</p>
<p>Uh offend People I'm in really offend People.</p>
<p>And he's completely unapologetic.</p>
<p>He says I know this might sound horrific but father and mother tear their baby apart.</p>
<p>Etc, etc, etc in fact.</p>
<p>He will also put it in the same thing in a more.</p>
<p>Soothing metaphor.</p>
<p>He says that when the child is born.</p>
<p>So you have to understand what child is.</p>
<p>What's the child in this case? Was it the physical baby? We yet, he's talking about that level.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>The child is this moment of consciousness.</p>
<p>The self of the moment. We talked about all the different scales of self any of those cells.</p>
<p>Can be?</p>
<p>The child.</p>
<p>It's born in between we don't notice that typically.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>If we did.</p>
<p>If we realized if we saw how 0 has just come apart.</p>
<p>And vibrated back and forth to mold feel image talk self in the touch sight sound surrounding seen in this moment, then we would know we would arise the baby. The child would arise as an enlightened self and it would know exactly what its job is.</p>
<p>The more gentle metaphor.</p>
<p>Is that the child the baby graciously gives back to father? What it got from father?</p>
<p>And graciously gives back to mother what it got from other.</p>
<p>And therefore the child as a thing disappears.</p>
<p>In other words, in this present said. Now I'll put on the V plus and I had, and explain the poetry.</p>
<p>Which maybe is bad but?</p>
<p>That's what I'm going to do so all of the.</p>
<p>Affirmations and negations the?</p>
<p>Vibrations of</p>
<p>Our senses.</p>
<p>Involved in this present moment of perception.</p>
<p>Can be analyzed?</p>
<p>Into.</p>
<p>Apart that.</p>
<p>Affirms.</p>
<p>And apart that negates their tangled together utterly and, if you allow everything that wants to push out.</p>
<p>In your sensory experience to simultaneously push out.</p>
<p>And everything that wants to pull in in your sensory experience to simultaneously pull in all the pushes become one giant.</p>
<p>Effortless expansion of pure space and all the pools become one infinitesimal effortless contraction of fools of pure space, but sort of like electrolysis imagine like?</p>
<p>Several 100 different tasting salts.</p>
<p>But they all have positive and negative ions.</p>
<p>You can't connect them across a potential by hooking up a battery.</p>
<p>So all those taste will completely disappear.</p>
<p>Well, but there will be.</p>
<p>3 tastes left.</p>
<p>The taste of positive the taste of negative and the taste of 0.</p>
<p>The taste of 0 is.</p>
<p>Pervades the positive.</p>
<p>Microscopic Lee is.</p>
<p>An pervades the negative and surrounds the whole thing.</p>
<p>We started early on talking about Manifesting, a complete self.</p>
<p>This is the graduate level version.</p>
<p>Of that concept.</p>
