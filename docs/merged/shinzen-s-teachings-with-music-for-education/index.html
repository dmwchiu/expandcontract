<p>And maybe institutions or educationally or health facilities well. I think the two things that come to mind immediately are that other teachers are using my materials to teach meditation YouTube materials. So they referring there, capturing YouTube segments and using them in the curriculum and I think that that's being done.</p>
<p>Both for People teaching meditation pragmatically in the public but also for People teaching courses on meditation in universities or courses that maybe like Buddhism. Asian culture comparative mysticism. That kind of thing where academic professors are assigning some of my YouTube segments, too.</p>
<p>Supplement the supplementary materials so.</p>
<p>That's that's one area then probably the most exciting thing is the development of music based mindfulness.</p>
<p>For kids.</p>
<p>And they're doing that in Portland State and it was phenomenally successful and we have so use youtubes show what we're doing in Burlington, Vt now. Sorry was in the public school system. First, he was just in this after school center with music based mindfulness for kids. Now he's in the public schools doing mindfulness and I think that's very exciting.</p>
