<p>Comes from originally from the early Buddhist perception of a Nietzsche or impermanence.</p>
<p>But if you look through Buddhist history.</p>
<p>You'll see that over the ages the notion of impermanence has been has itself been impermanent.</p>
<p>I'm not surprised.</p>
<p>It's changed overtime in some lineages for example.</p>
<p>If you</p>
<p>Work within the loop akin windage.</p>
<p>Rich involves the technique of body sweeping where you systematically move the awareness up and down through the body and.</p>
<p>Eventually, in other patterns also so making these sort of reciprocal's scans of somatic awareness.</p>
<p>This tends to.</p>
<p>Create.</p>
<p>Unawareness of a subtle Vibra Tori, bubbly flavor of flow.</p>
<p>That People find very pleasant. They're very carefully instructed not to form an attachment to that, but simply observe what is?</p>
<p>And then sometimes the opposite of that happens everything. It's very solid and intense and horrific and OK don't form an aversion to that just keep sweeping through a brilliant innovation.</p>
<p>Because it gets you down to a very fine scale of somatic resolution and at that scale vibra. Tori nature of the nervous system, the Vibra Tori nature of nature.</p>
<p>Will present itself to you and who bakin?</p>
<p>Talked about that as impermanence that's a Nietzsche.</p>
<p>But where is the book that talked about it always linked impermanence to duca?</p>
<p>Right things pass and we hold on to them and then we set ourselves up for suffering kidding. Our happiness on things that aren't going to last.</p>
<p>Here we get.</p>
<p>In the Uber Ken Linneage, a positive take on impermanence.</p>
<p>It's a kind of Purifying Enerji that gets activated within you and starts to work on, you, which sort of links it to notions of.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit working on you energia.</p>
<p>Long long before that was ever used in Physics in its present meaning.</p>
<p>It was used by Christian monks and nuns to describe the energy. Yeah, that working end with the energy of the working end within one of the Holy Spirit. That sort of dissolves the something nacin. The impurities within you well but can calls that activating impermanent said he puts a positive spin.</p>
<p>On impermanence and while at the same time of course, acknowledging the original Buddhist notion of impermanence as.</p>
<p>A possible source of suffering like a good scientist.</p>
<p>Built on the work of the printer.</p>
<p>Are you a he or whoever? His teachers were that came up with this notion?</p>
<p>My own teacher, Joshu Sasaki Rashi.</p>
<p>Has vastly?</p>
<p>Innovated with regards to the notion of change for impermanence.</p>
<p>He likes to describe it in terms of expansion and contraction.</p>
<p>To say that when you look carefully you see that all the different flavors of flow that can occur Vibra Tori, Angela Tori.</p>
<p>Even inward outward pressures and so forth.</p>
<p>These can all be interpreted.</p>
<p>In terms of two fundamental flow patterns.</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Expansion the other contraction you're going to have a sensation that's a solid as a rock.</p>
<p>But if you look if you analyze the pressure you can usually find there's an outward pressure in an inward pressure. Oh yeah, there banging together and clashing and producing a horrific pain, but the fact is if you let the part that wants to press in press in and the part that wants to push up with Charlotte. You let that happen, it gets worse.</p>
<p>They interdigitate.</p>
<p>And yes, indeed is just expansion and contraction empty space.</p>
<p>So you can take solid experiences and work with them and he gives this gigantic list of synonyms for expansion and contraction.</p>
<p>Expansion or call it life would call it affirmation you can call it.</p>
<p>Future you can call it outside, and then contraction could call it death. You can call it negation. You could call it pass. You can call it inside was that all these synonyms. Many of which don't seem to have anything in common?</p>
<p>If you get attached to the words.</p>
<p>But then if you listen deeply you'll see that there are pairs of binary contrasts that in some way or another involve the notion of affirmation versus negation.</p>
<p>Or bigness versus smallness.</p>
<p>In the path of purification decent embargo, which is sort of like the classic commentary on the Buddhist Canon used in much of SE Asia.</p>
<p>There's a place where the author put icosa describes the stage in practice.</p>
<p>Where you're observing the rising and passing of phenomena?</p>
<p>And then you become aware that.</p>
<p>And I was sooner does something arise, but it also passes.</p>
<p>Would I up by a is the word that's used in Poly, who die? Is rising up. PI's passing away so at some point, there is a simultaneous who dia MPI.</p>
<p>But it's described as?</p>
<p>It's passing as soon as it's arising.</p>
<p>Instead of saying observing phenomena rising in passing.</p>
<p>Or even passing arising and passing simultaneously society well, she says.</p>
<p>Be aware of simultaneous expansion and contraction.</p>
<p>Now, Why is that a subtle but significant?</p>
<p>Paradigm shift.</p>
<p>Well, if you listen to his talks, he will sometimes like get real emphatic.</p>
<p>Feel like get up there in Italy Bang is found Anne Hill, like raise his voice you know it's like Paul.</p>
<p>And a lot of times when he gets most emphatic about.</p>
<p>Is?</p>
<p>Something you can't.</p>
<p>Remotely understand either you can't understand it or it seems like absolutely.</p>
<p>Uh Pinal triviality.</p>
<p>Like sometimes it get up there. His bangs, his family says you must never forget never forget never forget as soon as you turn to the West.</p>
<p>The easters behind you as soon as you turn to the E the W is behind you never forget that.</p>
<p>Site.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, but he had done listen with the wisdom as soon as you turn to the West.</p>
<p>The E is there soon as you expand contraction is that OK. It's like any any binary contrast to him.</p>
<p>Exemplifies these principles OK never In other words, never forget as soon as there seems to be a rising passing is right there. That's what he's talking about we never tell you that OK.</p>
<p>You gotta figure that out.</p>
<p>Then get up there and you'll say.</p>
<p>You'll never get enlightenment doing 2 dimensional Zen.</p>
<p>Flats in is not then reels in is spherical real. Zen is a ball simultaneously expanding and contracting never do flat Zen.</p>
<p>What's flats in?</p>
<p>Flats in is I'm over here, observing rising and passing over there.</p>
<p>Once you start thinking in terms of.</p>
<p>Expansion and contraction, The Observer gets yanked into the process can dissolve.</p>
<p>So the 3:00 dimensionality of it prevents the fixation of the sense of an observer, which is the main criticism. Zen tends to give to be positive practice instead. Be aware as soon as something is arising.</p>
<p>3 dimensional space is expanding in 3, dimensional space are contracting. Yuan surrounding scenario. Spherical surface being just stated into existence, Annonay elevated.</p>
<p>By the simultaneous fountain of the flux and reflux of the source which is not a thing.</p>
<p>It's a pure doing.</p>
<p>Society, where she sometimes says a good doctor.</p>
<p>Can cure your illness but only the greatest doctors? Can show you you were never sick?</p>
