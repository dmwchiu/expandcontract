<p>Of.</p>
<p>Sensory clarity.</p>
<p>As a vehicle for insight.</p>
<p>And Liberation.</p>
<p>We don't have any historical record.</p>
<p>Uh this before the boot up.</p>
<p>Although he said there were boot does in the past, etc, etc. Basically, the idea is.</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p>You take the sense of self.</p>
<p>And you break it down into components.</p>
<p>Now there's a lot of ways, you can go about this before grade elements before foundations of mindfulness. The five five aggregates. There's a lot of possibilities. A lot of ways that the Pi can be chopped up if you're more on the I don't know scripturally oriented side you're very concerned with the particular sets of categories that are used.</p>
<p>Are too?</p>
<p>To untangle the web of limited identity, but for me, I'm not so concerned with the categories themselves as the general idea. I think it's one of the?</p>
<p>Most significant discoveries of our human species.</p>
<p>A parallel discovery took place in the West and in fact, is one of the things responsible for the domination.</p>
<p>Of Western culture.</p>
<p>But in the West, the principle. The principle of separate the strands that you can understand how the thing works and gain a handle on it, that principle was never applied internally.</p>
<p>But it was applied externally to the external natural world, in many, many domains starting with the Greece.</p>
<p>And the Greeks gave us a word for that process. It is a Greek word. That means to break something up in order to understand it and be empowered.</p>
<p>Analysis.</p>
<p>Analysis now implies some sort of.</p>
<p>Intellectual.</p>
<p>Formulation.</p>
<p>I'm going to analyze the situation, but originally the word analysis meant exactly what those those morphemes mean invent take the complicated thing break it down into its pieces see how the pieces interact with each other and you'll understand how the complicated thing works. It's dividing conquer stratagemma impair. The strategy of if you can untangle if you could find out what the fundamental.</p>
<p>Dimensions of the system? What are the primes? What are the atoms? What are the components?</p>
<p>That are involved in this system, they were going to get a handle on it.</p>
<p>The W eventually.</p>
<p>Discovered that.</p>
<p>The whole natural world could be analyzed in terms of mass.</p>
<p>Length.</p>
<p>Time thermodynamic temperature and electrical current their interactions.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Will give a complete understanding of the natural world, at least as known to modern physics.</p>
<p>But it took centuries and centuries and centuries of contention argument confusion to finally be able to define these components of the natural world, but it allowed for the arising of physics and physics allowed for.</p>
<p>Better ships and that her cannons and better machines and that allowed for the domination of Europe over the rest of the world.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>The W use divide and conquer in order to conquer the material world.</p>
<p>But in the E the Pooter discovered dividing conquer in order to conquer unlimited identity in order to conquer are.</p>
<p>Are suffering?</p>
<p>And the screwed up behaviors that come from our suffering.</p>
<p>He was called a conqueror some People don't like the dividing conquer they don't want to think the conquer is bad, but actually.</p>
<p>One of the words that was used to describe the put the less Gina.</p>
<p>JINA and that means the Conqueror 'cause when he was born.</p>
<p>The court astrology are was called in by his father, King Shoot Nodena. the Buddha was born in the country. A.</p>
<p>Cast, which is the Warrior Caste of India.</p>
<p>And the King asked the court astrology? What do you foresee for my son sitar to?</p>
<p>The Astrology said Your Majesty, you given birth to an extraordinary child.</p>
<p>He will either stay in the Palace and conquer India.</p>
<p>Which for them went conquered the world jumping to bebop meaning expand your empire from being a little clam up in NE, India to like you're running the show now.</p>
<p>Or he will leave this Pallas and conquer himself.</p>
<p>Conquer his limited identity and make his mark in history that.</p>
<p>His father wanted him to come to the world and so try to keep inside the Palace.</p>
<p>So this notion of if you want the more gentle formulation untangle and be free.</p>
<p>If you want the more.</p>
<p>Sharp formulation divide and conquer.</p>
<p>This is sensory clarity.</p>
<p>The 3rd component of mindfulness and as far as I as I mentioned as far as I can tell this was like.</p>
<p>A unique discovery.</p>
<p>And was central to the development of a whole new direction in human spirituality.</p>
<p>These are skills concentration sensory clarity equanimity are skills that can be developed with time.</p>
