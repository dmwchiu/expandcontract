<p>Physical body sensations.</p>
<p>External sites external sounds emotional body sensations, mental image internal talk or various pleasant restful experiences such as relaxation mental.</p>
<p>Quiet and so forth as you are exploring sensory experience, you could become aware of the presence of change.</p>
<p>If you became aware of the presence of change, you might become aware of the presence of change.</p>
<p>In various flavors.</p>
<p>Vibration undulation, etc, etc.</p>
<p>You might</p>
<p>Further get a sense that all change could be looked upon as.</p>
<p>In terms of pairs of contrasts.</p>
<p>And there's many dimensions, many types of contrast.</p>
<p>So I repeat it again more intense less intense speeds up slows down pressure pushes up pressure pulls in sensations or anything spreads collapses your attention is scattered in many directions your attention is gripped and held by one thing. These all can be looked upon as representations of expansion and contraction. Of course more than one can happen at the same time, you can you something can speed up and grip at the same time?</p>
<p>OK, it's speeding up that's expansion.</p>
<p>Gripping that's contraction something can spread and thin out at the same time, spreading that's expansion thinning out. That's contraction. So you can have just expensive flavors. Just contracted flavors and very frequently. You have both flavors at the same time, maybe in the same place maybe same time, but different plays.</p>
<p>So it could happen as you're paying attention to experience that you become aware of change.</p>
<p>It could happen that.</p>
<p>You become aware of.</p>
<p>How change can be looked upon in terms of various flavors of increase and decrease if so, if you become aware of change. Then you can explore the change if you become aware of change as.</p>
<p>Fundamentally being based on different flavors of increase, and decrease then you can note the increase, and decrease as expansion contraction. And if both happened at the same time, you can say both and by increase or decrease affirmation negation, I mean?</p>
<p>Along any of the dimensions that this can happen, speeding up slowing down OK should I go through the list again. Speeding up slowing down intensifying diminishing spreading collapsing outward pressure. Inward pressure scattering of your attention obsessing and gripping an fixation of your attention.</p>
<p>Outward and inward pressure are usually in the body looked upon his problems. We tend to blame are self. I'm resisting something I'm somehow not letting things do what they need to do certainly scattering and obsessing of our attention is looked upon as a problem. But you don't have to look upon them as problems you can just look upon them as reflections of the cosmic Dow.</p>
<p>Of the effortless.</p>
<p>Iflex an reflux of nature.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>If you become aware of if you don't become aware of change fine, then make empowering distinctions.</p>
<p>Just be you know bring concentration clarity and equanimity to the stability of your experience if you are aware of changing to want to explore. Generically then you can note flow gone. If the flow presents itself in a way where you can see.</p>
<p>You can analyze it into 2 fundamental flavors that an at any given instant there. Maybe just expensive qualities. Just contractive qualities or both at the same time, then you can go to a version of focus on change where you explicitly note and surrender to the expansion contraction or bidirectional flow.</p>
<p>So expansion contraction and both at the same time are so I look upon them as the fundamental flavors or a sort of fundamental way of looking upon all flow.</p>
<p>When expansion and contraction disappear.</p>
<p>Then there's 0.</p>
<p>There's The One.</p>
<p>There's the balance point, the still point.</p>
<p>Except for the point that still point there would be no dance and there is only the dance. It's a great great phrase so expansion and contraction are the dance. The still point is where the dance comes from and where it goes to an what Peppers it at all times.</p>
<p>Next step, it could happen, not necessarily not necessarily will or has to it could happen.</p>
<p>That as you're paying attention to expansion and contraction. Once again to repeat some of the expansion and contraction may not be that pleasant.</p>
<p>As you're paying attention to it, and yielding to it.</p>
<p>It could happen that you notice that whenever there's anything expensive space grows with it.</p>
<p>Whenever there's anything contractive space collapses.</p>
<p>Then you could focus on the expansion and contraction of the pure spacious nature of consciousness.</p>
<p>And that becomes an amazingly empowering and fulfilling experience, Essentia Lee, you get to feel the way the universe fields.</p>
<p>I guess that's why some People call it cosmic consciousness.</p>
<p>A further theme could present itself.</p>
<p>Not only</p>
<p>Do you have a sense?</p>
<p>That this is a dance of pure space this meaning everything.</p>
<p>The so called material world.</p>
<p>That that is so called outside.</p>
<p>The world of touch sight sound.</p>
<p>And this so called inner world, the world of thought and emotion that reacts to it and says, I am.</p>
<p>You say I am we say it is?</p>
<p>And that's true from a certain perspective.</p>
<p>But it is also true that.</p>
<p>The I an the IT.</p>
<p>R1 arabesque of flowing spacious Energi.</p>
<p>From another perspective.</p>
<p>It's the part wave particle duality is a beautiful metaphor for this.</p>
<p>That we can derive from modern physics, yes, we can say there's an eye and it it.</p>
<p>But we can also say that comes about.</p>
<p>As an artifact of.</p>
<p>Habits of consciousness.</p>
<p>Specifically, lack of concentration clarity and equanimity.</p>
<p>And if you have habitual concentration clarity and equanimity. You can tune into a different paradigm instead of the eye over here, always at the mercy of and it over there.</p>
<p>And eternally separate like 2 ice cubes cubes of ice that.</p>
<p>Can only bang together? There's the River called I and the River called it which will automatically become a single flow.</p>
<p>Can't prevent them can't prevent the 2:00 waves from adding and can't make.</p>
<p>The 2:00</p>
<p>Ice cubes.</p>
<p>Merge.</p>
<p>If you participate.</p>
<p>Even at the level of a hint, but the sort of dramatic things that I'm describing maybe are not.</p>
<p>Common experiences, but you may get a hint of what I'm talking about and even when you get a hint of it. That's highly significant for a human being.</p>
<p>In any event by having enough experiences of self in World, as integrated wave.</p>
<p>The I versus it paradigm actually goes away forever. It can never come back.</p>
<p>The sense of self separate from the world. Most assuredly can come back. But if there's been enough, I experience.</p>
<p>Then.</p>
<p>You can never really go back to I it, you can only go back to what Martin Buber called I thou.</p>
