<p>There's criterion that the Buddha gave.</p>
<p>When his students, said well how can we know if something is consonant with your teaching?</p>
<p>And that Criterion is called the public election.</p>
<p>So power means existence and that sounds like the English word BD it's not a coincidence.</p>
<p>So existence function, I is mark or characteristic.</p>
<p>So I said, well if you teach these 3 marks of existence, then that's consonant with.</p>
<p>What's all the foot does teach?</p>
<p>So if you're interested in these kinds of topics. It's good to actually learn the Poly so on each are most of you know that can you say it?</p>
<p>And after.</p>
<p>Dukie pronunciation.</p>
<p>So two guys usually translated that suffering and each impermanence and another kind of cell.</p>
<p>These are the marks of existence.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Not everyone in the world thinks Buddhism is right, you can go on the Internet and find all sorts of critiques and criticisms of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>So I think it's important to?</p>
<p>Oh, I think very clearly about these kinds of things if you want to be able to sort of.</p>
<p>Untangle.</p>
<p>Different things that People say, and have productive conversations.</p>
<p>So because I'm pretty much.</p>
<p>Oh, a logic and evidence based guy, I tend to think of myself.</p>
<p>A rationalist Imperial Imperial assist.</p>
<p>So I have to ask myself.</p>
<p>In all honesty.</p>
<p>How much of</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>Kens can survive the critique of science? How much of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Uh can survive the closest scrutiny and.</p>
<p>You know last into this century and last for a long, long time.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Would I ask myself that question in a?</p>
<p>Problem.</p>
<p>You know it very.</p>
<p>Uncensored way.</p>
<p>It seems to me that actually quite a bit can survive.</p>
<p>Which is extraordinary when you think about it?</p>
<p>Um given how old Buddhism is and so forth.</p>
<p>I don't think it can all survive, though the scrutiny of science, but</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>The parts that can survive are enormously useful and powerful.</p>
<p>Um so time will tell.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>Let's begin with Duca.</p>
<p>The claim that.</p>
<p>Suffering is</p>
<p>The nature of existence is suffering.</p>
<p>What about this will stand the scrutiny of careful investigation and what might not.</p>
<p>Well, First off where a little bit hit with a problem because a major feature.</p>
<p>In the formulation of Dukie is the assumption that we lived multiple lives that we in fact reincarnate.</p>
<p>And that most lifeforms are uncomfortable.</p>
<p>In the West there is a tendency to find reincarnation of a comforting thought all I'll be in Garden.</p>
<p>Back I'm coming back.</p>
<p>But in India that is not a comforting thought at all. It's a scary horrible thought.</p>
<p>Because Westerners typically always imagined that they're going to come back. You know well. They first of all the imagine they have been like Egyptian princesses, and you know, I was.</p>
<p>The advisor to you know the King or I was a llama into bed OK and then the assumption is when I come back. You know, maybe the president of the United States or but the Buddhist notion traditional food is motion is that?</p>
<p>Pleasant Incarnations are extremely rare.</p>
<p>Oh someone was once asked up the biophysicist found one of the founders of biophysics physics? How Dane if he could discern any.</p>
<p>Characteristic of God by having studied the mathematics of biology. Some of your laughing. You know, and his response was very funny. He said while apparently God has an inordinate fondness for beetles.</p>
<p>There are more beetle species far away than anything else so.</p>
<p>You know your your probability of your next 1000 lives being a beetle is very high, whereas being you know the vizier of the you know the pharaoh or whatever. You know, not very probable at all. In fact, even a fairly decent life where you get a chance to hear about meditation.</p>
<p>And practice baby practice, it, but at least you've heard the Dharma. You know what the traditional metaphor for how rare that is some of you do.</p>
<p>Well, there's there's a bunch of ones but there's this.</p>
<p>Oh, this is piece of wood that's floating in the ocean and has a little hole in it, and there is a turtle in the ocean.</p>
<p>And the probability that when the turtles.</p>
<p>That sticks his head out of the water, it will go through that exact point.</p>
<p>Yes, the probability that you'll hear the Dharma in your next lifetime.</p>
<p>So of course.</p>
<p>The lesson in that case is use this opportunity, OK, so part of the notion of suffering that's pretty intrinsic in traditional Buddhism.</p>
<p>And always talked about is most forms of existence are uncomfy.</p>
<p>And so the statement that did that suffering is the nature of existence is somewhat based on that notion.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Is there compelling evidence that in fact we have multiple lives?</p>
<p>Not that I can see.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if it were to turn out that we have multiple lives personally, I would not be in the slightest surprise.</p>
<p>Not in the slightest if it if the Buddhist tradition. Turns out to be absolutely correct in this regard wouldn't surprise me at all.</p>
<p>But that's not really the same as compelling evidence.</p>
<p>You know the Carl Sagan's thing about extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</p>
<p>Hum.</p>
<p>Now does it.</p>
<p>Is it? How can I put it? Does it makes? Can I understand? Why someone would think we reincarnate? Absolutely.</p>
<p>Because remember I've talked several times about these.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>States where you appreciate.</p>
<p>The full extent of what happens in the deep mind moment by moment, even when you're just processing ordinary sensory experience.</p>
<p>The deep mind in the limit.</p>
<p>Spreads out to encompass this and as far as I can see.</p>
<p>All conceivable worlds, it points to that I'm not saying it literally contains that but.</p>
<p>It's a month of on it, it's like a fractal and it just.</p>
<p>As you as you sort of look down into that where it's pointing to is all worlds and it is. This is called the experience of boundless conscious.</p>
<p>And it's</p>
<p>Part of the Java system. But it's not nothing mystical. She must've got something you can access just by.</p>
<p>Observing image space very, very carefully.</p>
<p>Oh, very, very deeply.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>With.</p>
<p>It's</p>
<p>You are that OK that's all in each of us.</p>
<p>And it's very easy to identify with any particular part of that.</p>
<p>And say, Oh yeah, I'm you know, I'm that part I'm not hard 'cause. We're all of it.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Meditators People that have looked deeply within.</p>
<p>It's</p>
<p>Not surprising that they would come up with the notion of well jump from life to life based on your behavior, etc etc.</p>
<p>So it's not an insignificant perception.</p>
<p>And to come to the point where you have that kind of awareness that depth of contact with.</p>
<p>How visual mind works is a very significant stage in practice?</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>Is that hard knows me?</p>
<p>But in fact, we, we have carted can, we show.</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<p>Scientists compelling evidence whereby they must accept this doctrine.</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>Maybe someday, maybe never.</p>
<p>Now, maybe it's a little shocking to you to hear someone who works within the Buddhist traditions sort of say something like this.</p>
<p>But I've been on stage with the Dalai Lama to bed like closer to him than I am to sync on right now.</p>
<p>And heard him say if science should someday prove that in fact, there is no reincarnation, then we have to modify please.</p>
<p>Imagine that that's the Dalai Lama up to that whose entire power base is predicated on this entire system OK. So you know if you want to gripe don't come to me, he's got my back.</p>
<p>That's like really in.</p>
<p>For the future of humanity.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>What about this notion that the nature of suffering existence is by nature suffering?</p>
<p>To me, it's contentious to predicate that on the belief that we, we reincarnated and that.</p>
<p>Pleasant lives are very rare.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>Let's see what we can say that more or less is not contentious that no one would disagree with.</p>
<p>To what extent is suffering the nature of existence.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>One of the things that you learn with this practice.</p>
<p>Is that all the pain is?</p>
<p>Unavoidable fit physical and emotional pain are unavoidable.</p>
<p>Suffering is in fact.</p>
<p>Optional.</p>
<p>Suffering is what happens when you would experience pain without skill.</p>
<p>Oh, when you have an incomplete experience of pain and suffering.</p>
<p>To the extent that you start to bring concentration clarity and course.</p>
<p>Equanimity major factor to that extent on.</p>
<p>The pain becomes more poignant and less problematic, it still motivates and directs.</p>
<p>It doesn't drive and distort it's part of the richness of being a human but it does not.</p>
<p>Paul our existence.</p>
<p>So when you look around and you realize that.</p>
<p>Suffering is optional and then you look at how much suffering there is you realize that.</p>
<p>And enormous amount.</p>
<p>Of what People go through from the interest psychic to the interpersonal to the international level.</p>
<p>Um and Inter community level in between there is an enormous amount of absolutely avoidable suffering going on.</p>
<p>Hum.</p>
<p>And that's</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>That gives credence to this view that.</p>
<p>Certainly the nature of.</p>
<p>Existence.</p>
<p>For People that.</p>
<p>Don't work **** ** themselves.</p>
<p>They are entails.</p>
<p>An enormous amount of suffering.</p>
<p>So I think that stands the test of logic.</p>
<p>And evidence.</p>
<p>Um and it's important to know it's like hugely important enough.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>So there's that.</p>
<p>There's also something else.</p>
<p>The Buddhist tradition.</p>
<p>Says that even pleasant things are on unpleasant.</p>
<p>Which seems maybe doesn't does not seem to ring true to People?</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>But it's all a matter of thong.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>It's relative I guess might be one way to put it.</p>
<p>What People call pleasurable?</p>
<p>Relative to the experience of complete pleasure.</p>
<p>Is actually?</p>
<p>Painful.</p>
<p>It's slightly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>But you don't realize that until you start to have experiences of complete player.</p>
<p>But most People seeking pleasure is intensity, duration and variety not actually that there's anything wrong with those things.</p>
<p>But there's another dimension, which is that is not the dimension of any of those, 3 intensity in a variety or?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Duration.</p>
<p>There's another dimension, which is how fully you experience the pleasure.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Which is measured by how much concentration clarity and equanimity bring to the pleasure?</p>
<p>And once you start to.</p>
<p>Have some experiences that are starting to approach pure pleasure.</p>
<p>Pleasure on alloyed with craving and aversion and gaps in awareness and unconscious.</p>
<p>Alert pure pleasure is actually pure fulfillment.</p>
<p>And relative to that when you look back at quote ordinary experiences of pleasure that you had as a non meditator.</p>
<p>Or in the early years of your practice.</p>
<p>There is a kind of coagulations intention around it.</p>
<p>That is.</p>
<p>Suddenly, painful.</p>
<p>I'm so.</p>
<p>This way is not.</p>
<p>Obvious until you done better meditation.</p>
<p>But I think this is another way in which the Buddhist claim about the suffering nature of things does does pass the test of logic and evidence evidence, meaning you could check it out yourself and see if it's not true.</p>
<p>And relative to near Bama.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Which is the limit of complete experience?</p>
<p>So complete that it is right on the cusp of existence and nonexistence.</p>
<p>Um relative to Nirvana everything hurts.</p>
<p>Um suddenly something sadly but suddenly significant.</p>
<p>So actually.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Through this doctor him does pretty foot.</p>
<p>About the</p>
<p>Suffering nature of things.</p>
<p>There's also the flip side, which is the nature of suffering which I've already.</p>
<p>Sort of mention of at least the way I think about it nature of suffering is what happens when we have.</p>
<p>Uncomfortable experiences.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Without concentration clarity and equanimity.</p>
<p>And it's also what happens when we have neutral experiences without those it is also what happens when we have pleasant experiences without growth.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>This is so this is one of the first insights.</p>
<p>That I have in my meditation career.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>As you all know I.</p>
<p>I approached Buddhism.</p>
<p>The old fashioned way it was old school it was Asia.</p>
<p>An they you know.</p>
<p>They made me sit in the full Lotus from flower and.</p>
<p>From you know hour after hour that it was all about pain. It was all about pink. I thought This is Looney tunes, but</p>
<p>So, but it was like so worth it because.</p>
<p>Is sitting there and it's like it's getting worse and worse and worse?</p>
<p>And then at some point.</p>
<p>Discrimination vipasana seeing separate.</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p>Actually, see that the pain is one thing and the fighting with the pain.</p>
<p>It's not.</p>
<p>They are different critters.</p>
<p>And before that, you never notice because as soon as there was the pain there was the fighting.</p>
<p>So this someday some.</p>
<p>So tricky lawyer is going to do some tort case where they're going to say. Well, this person is a Buddhist so they can only be recompensed from the pain not to suffer. I was always like you get pain and suffering right. Oh, I should put this on the Internet. So I don't actually think of this OK at your boots right. So we only going to give you half as much 'cause. We just got the paint and then the suffering I could be meditating.</p>
<p>So you could see it, it's like so all my life. Until I started meditating. It's like well as soon as I have pain I've suffering with the same thing.</p>
<p>And that's why the lawyers ask for you get paid for pain and suffering if you had a toy.</p>
<p>But now I can see it's like OK, the pain is one thing.</p>
<p>And my mental judgments about it are quite a different thing and the way my body tightens around. It is yet a completely different thing and Oh yeah, we can relax that that tightening and we can let go. Those judgments and then it's like does it hurt? Yes, but it's just not the same that discrimination that was that was worth?</p>
<p>Every moment of what I had to go.</p>
<p>Because otherwise I never would have known.</p>
<p>Would go into some cut?</p>
<p>Pain is one thing this up the suffering is the resistance to the pain is a completely different thing. And when the 2:00 come together you have suffering so that's the nature of suffering.</p>
<p>Uhm and then when.</p>
<p>There is just the thing without this other stuff is less suffering and then I extrapolate.</p>
<p>It's like OK if.</p>
<p>If diminishing the resistance, somewhat causes the suffering to diminish somewhere then.</p>
<p>Where will this lead, well it is theoretically possible that there could be 0 resistance and therefore?</p>
<p>No suffering at all, and that would apply both to emotional pain and physical thing. So if I only got that one insight in my entire meditation career, but still be worth the price of admission because otherwise I would have had to live my life without knowing Oh my God? How does anyone live their life without knowing that?</p>
<p>You've got this sort of Damocles hanging over your head it can fall down anytime.</p>
<p>So you know.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>There's the suffering nature, which I think has.</p>
<p>Maybe not.</p>
<p>You know everything that the Buddhist tradition says about that. It is valid, but I think plenty of it is when you analyze.</p>
<p>Is that suffering nature and then there's the nature of suffering?</p>
<p>Which is?</p>
<p>Very very useful insight.</p>
<p>And each of our answer, Duca or the OK, Uh Nietzsche impermanence what about that.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>That's pretty evident.</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>Things don't last.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>And if we</p>
<p>Kill of 100% of our happiness.</p>
<p>On things that aren't going to last then we are definitely setting ourselves up for something.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>And what else is there to say about that, well a couple things actually.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>One of the criticisms of Buddhism is that?</p>
<p>Well, because they that it encourages People to become indifferent.</p>
<p>2 circumstances object if circumstances because it's all impermanent.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Why bother why care?</p>
<p>Ann.</p>
<p>And it doesn't help that the early Buddhist lifestyle was one of renouncing the society and going off and you know living sannyasi life. That means you. You know when you when I became a Buddhist monk in Japan is quite a little ceremony that you do you?</p>
<p>Well, I haven't thought about this for a long time.</p>
<p>What was it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cool, football, Google to Chica.</p>
<p>Just remember it in Japanese.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>The shave most of your head except from cattle.</p>
<p>Piece of they leave.</p>
<p>And I could shape at the at the ceremony.</p>
<p>Symbolically, that's the last thing you put on robes for the first time.</p>
<p>I would have thought about this for a long this is like 1970.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>With the roads have really long sleeves.</p>
<p>And I have.</p>
<p>So they put these robes on you, you know you complete the sound when you get glass little piece of hairs cut off.</p>
<p>And then you have to go like to this shrine area chance of Montrose and things and so I like walked out the door right and the first thing I did was catch that sleeve on a post at rip it. There is OK. This is mindfulness clothes. I've got an please close are designed to make you pay very close attention, you know just like.</p>
<p>That's a good spot, but what I was remembering was that just before they cut off that last hair thing.</p>
<p>There are 3 cop Camaronal Kokomo in Japanese of those.</p>
<p>Scrolls that hang you know, or like long rectangular pieces of paper and you have to bow.</p>
<p>Bow to each 1, three times to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Goodbye forever.</p>
<p>And the first one says Fumo.</p>
<p>Full father mother.</p>
<p>And the second one says Cocoa War.</p>
<p>For one.</p>
<p>The king of the country where the ruler of the country.</p>
<p>Uh and the 3rd one says which he got me in Japanese.</p>
<p>Chinese at work.</p>
<p>Josh and your family God's.</p>
<p>And you say goodbye that represents all traditional Society of ancient times in Asia?</p>
<p>You say goodbye that in a completely?</p>
<p>You are true jar, you have left shoot cat, you have left at all.</p>
<p>That's got some the Oscar in sounds great.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>That was the system that was set up in.</p>
<p>Perfect big in India because India is a very stereotype society and has had had and still has very stereotyped roles, so if you want it to be a transcendent specialist.</p>
<p>This good news you can't the society will support you but you have to shave your head and wear the robes of a criminal you know the orange jumpsuits since like criminals. The same thing. And yet they met you like you're just out of the pale of society.</p>
<p>We would just the whole different thing.</p>
<p>Um so.</p>
<p>Because there is that social model in Buddhism, you can see why People and then because.</p>
<p>There's this notion OK everything is impermanent so Buddhism was teach People that.</p>
<p>To be indifferent to circumstances and the needs of society.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>I'm I'm criticizing to in order to answer answer. The critics OK. This is the stuff that you see on the Internet.</p>
<p>Anti the things that People that don't like movies of this is the kind of things that they say about.</p>
<p>Oh, it's like a?</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Because it teaches everything is any com pounded thing is impermanent so.</p>
<p>Don't know the implication is why bother about compound things and besides is sort of the proof of that is these social structure of early Buddhism, which was just say goodbye to the world.</p>
<p>No just because India at that time had a certain social structure.</p>
<p>And that worked for the boot that does not mean there is anything intrinsic in the notion of impermanence.</p>
<p>That says, we should be indifferent to circumstance.</p>
<p>On.</p>
<p>It just says that we should not pin 100% of our happiness on circumstance.</p>
<p>Which I think is very reasonable?</p>
<p>Oh, we should allocate a certain amount of time in Enerji.</p>
<p>Thoards exploring happiness that is not dependent on something that is impermanent.</p>
<p>And Unfortunately that form of happiness actually does exist.</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p>Often see a confusion between.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>The attachment or indifference with regards to the object if world.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>The attachment or</p>
<p>I wouldn't even say indifference. I would just say People confuse that with what I call equanimity now and so my concept of equanimity is designed to answer the critics.</p>
<p>And also to clarify things for People that work with in the Buddhist tradition.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>The ability to let sensory experience come and go without pushing pool.</p>
<p>The ability to do that.</p>
<p>I think is a very important ability.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>That does not mean?</p>
<p>2 things.</p>
<p>It is the ability to allow sensory experience to come and go without involvement.</p>
<p>To take a hands off attitude.</p>
<p>With regards to the expansion and contraction of sensory experience.</p>
<p>That ability does not imply 2 things that some People think it.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>A pretty radical thing.</p>
<p>Because we're not just talking about body sensations were talking about mental states. Also, the ability to allow sense and nonsense to come and go.</p>
<p>With indifference.</p>
<p>The ability to allow physical and emotional pleasure and pain to kum and go with indifference with regards to how they expanded contract in your senses.</p>
<p>That ability is very useful.</p>
<p>But notice I said the ability.</p>
<p>Because what People think you're saying is that you're supposed that you're advocating walking around all the time.</p>
<p>Stop on that and their own.</p>
<p>Equanimity is an ability.</p>
<p>On.</p>
<p>On demand when it's appropriate.</p>
<p>To be able to have this hands off attitude.</p>
<p>At other times.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>You can absolutely take a stand with regards to your sensory experience. We do it all the time every time we do on Earth are positive.</p>
<p>We're saying we're selectively attending to positive content.</p>
<p>We're not just letting anything common, though, that's A.</p>
<p>That's a different practice.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Actually, the ability to let negatives come and go in the background.</p>
<p>Helps us selectively attend to positive content.</p>
<p>And even to be open to that positive content informing are being which is the nurture positive practice.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>The ability to when it's appropriate or when you want to to detach from sense and nonsense in the mind.</p>
<p>Positive and negative thoughts, but can come and go without caring.</p>
<p>Without or rather without pushing for the ability to do that. The ability to let pleasure and pain physical, emotional common goal. The ability to allow things to congeal and melt without.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Without preferences that is equanimity and that's a hugely useful skill to.</p>
<p>But it doesn't mean that that's all you ever do just because you have that skill. You can take a stand you can reject negative thoughts.</p>
<p>Fact you could do that better if you have that skill and the other thing that it doesn't imply is that you are indifferent to external circumstances that you're going to take a hands off attitude with regards to how your life goes or helping society goes.</p>
<p>And I would claim that in fact, the ability to.</p>
<p>Not interfere with sense with the way the world makes you feel.</p>
<p>Freeze up enerji too.</p>
<p>Take a stand.</p>
<p>To make the world a better place.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Yes, everything in the world may be ultimately impermanent Ann.</p>
<p>There, for 2.</p>
<p>Pin your happiness on it is 100% is not a good idea, but you could hit some happiness on it is some limited predictability's in the world.</p>
<p>On but you want to have another source of happiness when it's not dependent on impermanent things.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Be so.</p>
<p>That's why I formulated the notion of equanimity and I always say it's a relation is a skill.</p>
<p>That's a relationship to sensory experience and should never be, but confused with indifference to circumstances. But there's a deep deep deep reason why People do, make that confusion.</p>
<p>Because it is not easy.</p>
<p>2 left my to just allow the world to impact on your mind body without interfering with that in.</p>
<p>It seems like you're gonna just dial and it seems like you're going to become.</p>
<p>Passive and ineffectual.</p>
<p>In other words.</p>
<p>The sensory experience of.</p>
<p>Equanimity.</p>
<p>At a deep level initially.</p>
<p>Seems like it's going to make you indifferent and therefore vulnerable at irresponsible and so you're afraid to have complete equanimity.</p>
<p>And it's only after you sort of gone over that hump and he realized no it doesn't work that way.</p>
<p>Just because I have the ability to.</p>
<p>It's experienced the litany of horrors that is the 6:00 o'clock news, so fully that I don't suffer.</p>
<p>That does not mean that I stop caring.</p>
<p>About.</p>
<p>What I see on television in fact very much the opposite but?</p>
<p>Some part of us doesn't believe that until we get over that hump.</p>
<p>And so it just holds on and it's like no, I can't totally let this let this.</p>
<p>Help me because then I'm gonna be happy.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Impermanence.</p>
<p>So what is it?</p>
<p>That we can have that.</p>
<p>Will be a reliable source?</p>
<p>Condition things on her.</p>
<p>Impermanent well.</p>
<p>Weather will talk about that in a moment.</p>
<p>Oh no self.</p>
<p>It's</p>
<p>There's a very good reason to.</p>
<p>Define enlightenment in terms of.</p>
<p>Realizing yourself.</p>
<p>As long as</p>
<p>You don't get too caught up in words.</p>
<p>Because half the world calls that experience that Russo.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>If you're caught up in words, then it's like he just he misses the point. You can't you can't see the liberation.</p>
<p>In People that have FIA stick religions or People that are working within a Hindu context that are talking about realizing the true witness, which himself you know you can't see that the yoga sutras are talking about the same thing. That's the Buddhist sutras. You can't see that because the description is seems to be the dialectic up of the even the diametric opposite.</p>
<p>If British Enlightenment is no self and someone goes around, saying self self self than they must be?</p>
<p>Quite.</p>
<p>The Skyland.</p>
<p>No, they just chosen for.</p>
<p>Very legitimate reasons to call back self.</p>
<p>So I would just give that one little caveat. We don't want.</p>
<p>The litmus test to be certain words.</p>
<p>You want the witness test to be certain experience.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>How it's been my experience that?</p>
<p>There are perhaps.</p>
<p>For different.</p>
<p>Flavors of no so.</p>
<p>Hum I like to.</p>
<p>Use the</p>
<p>This intersystem mental image mental talk and body in motion for a lot of different reasons. I like to use that to analyze.</p>
<p>The simple The experience of self as a sensory system. Now there's other ways to chop up that pot.</p>
<p>Is the 5 aggregates is the four foundations. You could broadly say well? Anything minded body itself etc? Etc for various reasons parsimony and a bunch of other Oh parsonline that just means.</p>
<p>Simplest.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'd like to use that system so just for now, we're going to work within that sis.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>I always like to say that the inner see, hear feel sometimes react to the outer sight sound touch.</p>
<p>Sometimes it goes off proactive spins memory plan fantasy.</p>
<p>The individual elements interact.</p>
<p>With each other that's why I'm calling assist.</p>
<p>Assist.</p>
<p>And then every once in awhile this, the interactivity just turns off.</p>
<p>Sometimes it turns off because out expand.</p>
<p>There's only a finite amount of real estate in consciousness, so out expands it in contracts and that's those famous said stories of master enlightening.</p>
<p>An the master says come down.</p>
<p>Let's see I like.</p>
<p>The idea being for just a moment before there was the reaction.</p>
<p>If you just love back OK, you see the system just went off line, the inner systems just swamped by the sound.</p>
<p>But it's very hard to notice that.</p>
<p>But if you said it just sort of watch.</p>
<p>Either because out expands or just because the system just goes offline.</p>
<p>When the interactivity ceases there's no sense of I.</p>
<p>And if you're looking for a hearing or touching something external.</p>
<p>And that continues unbroken 30 seconds a minute, 2 minutes, the inner system does not activate.</p>
<p>Your identity just goes elastic it, you just start inhabiting what was formally out.</p>
<p>So that's that's one flavor of no self.</p>
<p>Another flavor of no self is well the system is activated.</p>
<p>But the components at all of their fractal scales are completely on tank.</p>
<p>Does remember it's not just one scale of image Top bottle Moshe?</p>
<p>Inside and images all sorts of subtle talking body in motion and eat inside each one of those trends is like subtle.</p>
<p>Subtle images OK and so untangling this.</p>
<p>Multi scale scheme.</p>
<p>Of inner see, hear feel as no small it's no small deal. But if you get them completely untangle.</p>
<p>An emergent property.</p>
<p>Called Self is thin vanished.</p>
<p>And you know, I've given several metaphors for that.</p>
<p>If you have red and white thread and.</p>
<p>You just sort of tangle them together and look at it from a distance seems to be pink.</p>
<p>But then as you get closer and look at what's actually there. The emergent property be illusory property of Paintless goes away.</p>
<p>It's still red and there's white.</p>
<p>So there's see, hear feel inner inner see, hear feel mental image. Mental talk body motion, particularly the self preferential stuff and in general, all of it.</p>
<p>Um and it's all tangled together.</p>
<p>And with sensory clarity if at all the scales, not just the surface scale, but it all the scales you get.</p>
<p>Those waveforms.</p>
<p>Completely untangled.</p>
<p>And they are able to interpenetrate without interfering like solid Tom raise.</p>
<p>On that.</p>
<p>Gives you an experience of flow self that is unknown. I'm sorry that gives you an experience of.</p>
<p>I'm no self that's based on.</p>
<p>Cut.</p>
<p>On paper.</p>
<p>Untangling or resolution effect and this is the classic description of no self in early Buddhism is usually applied to the 5:00 aggregates.</p>
<p>And I've given many talks. You've heard this many times the it's also done with the four great elements in early Buddhism. This is shocking.</p>
<p>Descripcion approved again S just as a skillful butcher.</p>
<p>Would carve up?</p>
<p>A steer</p>
<p>And at some point, the perception steer goes away and the perception meet arises that's actually in the Buddhist Scriptures.</p>
<p>Clearly, they weren't vegetarians like 500 years ago.</p>
<p>I'm at least.</p>
<p>Someone OK so you chop it up and the perception well, just to extend the metaphor. The perception self goes away in the perception intercede here field clearly arise.</p>
<p>And it's not nothing called stuff, so that's so if we call the turning off of the inner system, though self in the sense of it, you know, I sometimes jokingly call the.</p>
<p>But no self experience that comes through fully untangling. I call that no self KMOWU so fully have known the components that it's another subject.</p>
<p>On.</p>
<p>Then those individual components can.</p>
<p>Show you that their vibrating superstrings this of course, is just a metaphor again not saying it's quantum physics, OK, but if there's sort of like vibrating superstrings they're.</p>
<p>There.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>Vibrating space.</p>
<p>Ann.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>The whole sometimes the whole inner system, even if you can't untangle.</p>
<p>The strands at all the levels.</p>
<p>You get this sense that the surface activity in the Inter system is sort of gone away. But there's this undercurrent of shimmering on the mental screen. There's this rumbling and talk space and kind of idling emotional circuits. There's this vibra. Tori flow that's filling the subjective space.</p>
<p>If you sort of zoom out cover that whole space and just sort of give permission for that interfield to shimmer.</p>
<p>That will create another another flavor of insight into them.</p>
<p>And then um.</p>
<p>There is the even deeper experience.</p>
<p>Of what's behind that shimmering field.</p>
<p>Which is?</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p>Effortless simultaneous expansion contraction that I talk about every time I talk almost.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>This is</p>
<p>Sasaki Roshi called it mujou nor Ha Tarlac.</p>
<p>The activity of Impermanence Congella Hockey, the activity of the source.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Push Oh no hataraki the activity of the brutal nature, they just all Simmons.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>It's about impermanence is maybe it's Maine.</p>
<p>Leaving.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Because.</p>
<p>It's like trying to pin site trying to nail tofu into the wall.</p>
<p>OK, as soon as you think it's expansion. It's also contraction as soon as you think it's contractions also expansion.</p>
<p>And it embraces.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>It is a kind of flow of space.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>There could be a figure ground reversal.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Where it you say that well because that's what's?</p>
<p>Behind all.</p>
<p>That Phone.</p>
<p>And that form is what you see, hear feel is made of.</p>
<p>Then this is what?</p>
<p>Hum.</p>
<p>And that's where the</p>
<p>I really comes in that we finally come back and answer a question.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>If condition things are.</p>
<p>Important.</p>
<p>OK, so we shouldn't pin all of our happiness on the.</p>
<p>Oh, we can put some happiness.</p>
<p>But we should.</p>
<p>We should allocate a certain amount of time and energy to.</p>
<p>Finding.</p>
<p>Eh.</p>
<p>Happiness and ordering principle that is.</p>
<p>Permanent.</p>
<p>And that's where the little iron, we can be found.</p>
<p>Because it is the activity of improvement.</p>
<p>That is our two birthday.</p>
<p>Hum.</p>
<p>And since it can it does give us an experience of not only the inner see, hear feel, but the outer see her feel arising.</p>
<p>Co arising.</p>
<p>Not only does it provide that?</p>
<p>Permanent.</p>
<p>Fulfillment because even after the minor body die to the extent that.</p>
<p>You said I'm not my mind, and body but I am this.</p>
<p>And the activity left.</p>
<p>Is responsible for my mind of them to the extent that you said that many many times thousands of times thousands of times a day during a lifetime to that extent, you don't know you just.</p>
<p>Side swept and you just do it and rub about the around the.</p>
<p>Passing away of your mind above.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>So, in case could be made that therein lies.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Unknown source of happiness.</p>
<p>But because it's not just.</p>
<p>What molds?</p>
<p>Oh, the inner world, but the inner sphere field once the outer scene.</p>
<p>So it seems like you're always.</p>
<p>Looking at.</p>
<p>That with which you share root.</p>
<p>You're looking at your your?</p>
<p>The fraternity and sorority of creation are in your face constantly.</p>
<p>And so that source of personal.</p>
<p>Permanent happiness.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Is also a constant reminder to?</p>
<p>Care about other People.</p>
<p>Thus Totaly giving the lie both the totaly overcoming the misconception that People would do this practice become indifferent to the plight of others.</p>
