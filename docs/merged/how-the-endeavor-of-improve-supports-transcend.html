<p>Um.</p>
<p>Sometimes, if you</p>
<p>Do some good thing in the world.</p>
<p>Special you volunteer you do something and then you go back to your formal practice you'll see that.</p>
<p>It's sort of like now, it's moving again.</p>
<p>That would be an example of the the saver or the what you put out.</p>
<p>Influencing what you experience.</p>
<p>It's it goes to a somewhat somewhat broader formulation.</p>
<p>Which is?</p>
<p>See beyond self in world refined self, it or improve self, OK, so you make improvements in yourself in your world.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>That will then influence your experience during formal practice, which is the main place that you're trying to see beyond the self in the world. So it's a little larger than save. It's more improved, yeah for example.</p>
<p>Diet lifestyle ethics, Cilla OK. Traditionally, it, said well sort of get that together before you even try to set because otherwise it's just going to be cast sitting when we try to set so the fact that you have a certain lifestyle that you have that you're not bringing all this.</p>
<p>Awareness of guilt and bad, Karma you know.</p>
<p>To your since you know it conflicted about as as less conflicted about your life because you're living your life in a better way.</p>
<p>You know, perhaps diet enters in exercises. All that sort of stuff, so those are those are improvements in yourself, you bring those improvements will probably improve your experience informal practice and then there's the knowledge that you're putting up good good things into the world and that's in your subliminal consciousness.</p>
<p>And it's</p>
<p>There, when you whether your surface aware of it or not. It's sort of there in your practice and that supports you also so it's it's really broader than how.</p>
<p>Save support Sodom and it's more like how the Endeavour of improve supports the Endeavour of transit.</p>
