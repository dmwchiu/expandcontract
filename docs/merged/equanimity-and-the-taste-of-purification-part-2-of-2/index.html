<p>Concept of asceticism that was present in does time probably.</p>
<p>Originally starting and show monic ordeals for powers and then People notice well. If I sort of torture myself. I sorta get better as a person and then the good to saying how it's not the fact that you're torturing yourself. In these ceremonies. You're experiencing uncomfortable sensations with equanimity. That's purify conscious is but you could do just as well with pleasure.</p>
<p>And if you look at the classic Buddhist texts with the longer discourses of the Buddha.</p>
<p>He Essentia Lee describes going into altered blissful States and having equanimity with them.</p>
<p>And that purifying consciousness through through the process of becoming having equanimity with these absorption's and then that taking you to something that is beyond Bliss. Beyond pleasure beyond all dualities, which is the absolute rest up Nirvana. So there's an actual description of working with a lot of descriptions actually of working with pleasant experiences.</p>
<p>But with an emphasis on equanimity, they purify consciousness, they deeply fulfill an if they purify conscious.</p>
<p>Profoundly enough blocks to Nirvana are worked through there are what time called the do. Tom does Witcher depending on how you want to count them 12 or 13 uncomfortable practices that the monks were allowed to do, but not required to do like like ya. For example, a person could take a vow. I'm not gonna sit always at night, not lay down that is a practice.</p>
<p>But not not for one night, OK, a person could say I'm going to do this for the duration or for a week or something like that, and that's one of the 2 Tom 'cause That's the term that was for 4:00 allowed uncomfortable practices. But the Buddha didn't allow uncomfortable practices that would be harmful to your body or that would wipe you out, so badly that you.</p>
<p>You weren't really doing practice anymore, you would just sit in.</p>
<p>You know out of it.</p>
<p>Equanimity is</p>
<p>Another of the components that constitutes mindful awareness in the way that I like to think about mindful awareness.</p>
