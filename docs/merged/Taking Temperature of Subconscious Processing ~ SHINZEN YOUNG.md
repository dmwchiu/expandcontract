One of my favorite.

Uh.



Joke now we're not jokes, but just funny things that I'll ask someone is.

Do you think that like you look at a neon light bulb neon or that kind of thing?

You could touch it right, it's cold.

But I'll say.

Do you believe me that the that?

The temperature inside that neon bulb.

Is compara bulto the temperature in the core of the sun?

Most People would say no way right, but actually it is The thing is there just aren't very many molecules in there.

So it doesn't transfer much heat to you.

But there there plasma there like the like there on the sun. They're moving that fast, but it's has very little density. So you touch it. They don't transfer hardly any heat to you at all, so you have no perception of of.

How really much enerji there is an average but like I say hi average kinetic energy but if you don't have a lot of particles than the total enerji. They're going to transfer to the surface of that bulb is not very much OK, so anyway end of physic lesson? What is the metaphor.

Well, you'll recall that Freud.

Thought of the psyche in terms of pressures because that was sort of the.

The physics of the day.



What I find interesting is that?

If you

Parse your mental experience.

Into.

A visual component, which it would be mental images and an auditory component, which would be mental talk.

When you start to do that you.

You're aware of images a lot of times they vanish right away or aware of talk. Sometimes it just vanish is but at some point that sort of surface activity tends to go away.

But the space image space is still there talk space is still there and when you tune into image space or talk space. Sometimes you're aware of a kind of subtle undercurrent of motion like there's a kind of stirring in talk space. You may or may not be able to make out words. You may or may not be able to make out what the conversation is about.

But there's a sort of undercurrent of activation and there's something analogous to that in image space.

And there can also be something analogous to that in your emotional centers. You're not actually experiencing any emotion per se, but it's like there's something sort of idling down there.

So.

What is that lot of times People will say sort of look up on that as a problem it's like I can't get rid of. That sort of undercurrent of something going on down there well, what that is, is.

Subconscious visual thought.

Subconscious auditory thought.

And subliminal emotional sensation.

Um.

And if you explore inner inner space image space. Talkspace emotional body space when the surface stuff is sort of dissipated.

And you're watching that.

That general level of?

Stirring down there.

Sometimes it's uniform.

It just sort of is at a constant pace OK.

Other times it sort of speeds up and then subside sort of bursts and then subsides subside.

So.

Although you are not aware of the specific content necessarily.

Of the subconscious.

You are monitoring by monitoring the general level of activation.

Do you see the metaphor?

You're taking the temperature of the subconscious.

You're monitoring sort of metaphorically the average kinetic energy. That's going on. And if the temperature is more or less constant. It's all sort of at the same frequency.

Then, what's optimal is too evenly cover subjective space and just let your awareness sort of soak into that whole field.

And.

What that's going to tend to do?

Is?



Break up the

Is going to lessen the viscosity?

So this density viscosity temperature entropy these are called state variables.

And these are sort of the This is great.

The Great achievement of 19th century physics, one of the great achievements is statistical thermodynamics, so there are these state variables, so if it's more or less like an even level of Vibra Tori activity.

Then sort of cover the whole space, you soak awareness into it. You don't try to figure out what's going on, you give it permission to just sort of move around down there.

And you'll find that that will cause that system to become.

More and more fluid, meaning less and less viscous.

On.

On the other hand, if you notice pattern that it's sort of activates and deactivates so it's sort of like heats up and then suddenly cools off metaphorically.

What's optimal in that case is too.

Watch this sort of burst of energy and then detect the gone and briefly look.

Down the Valley where those little bubbles went too. 'cause they're pointing right to Nirvana right to cessation. So you get launched you gone if it gives you that pattern that get interested in the rhythm of arising passing arising passing but this is subtle vibrations. Sort of shimmering and then dying away when that foam sort of dies away the silence.

That, it points to is the absolute rest. The still point of the turning world, so there's a metaphor from good old 19th century physics.

I mentioned that.

So, in my mind, I think of this is well how cool is this, if Freud. It only known you can actually take the temperature in real time of the subconscious mind.

And in doing so, the viscosity of the Subconscious gets worked through.

And when when the Subconscious Self, the psyche. This inner see, hear feel self when it flows it.

Gets creative.

And liberated.

So.

That's



One of my favorite metaphors, taking the temperature of the unconscious in real time.

As a function of space.

Temperature of this room is what a scientist would call a scalar field.

Uh it means or a time varying scalar field.

Means at each point in the space of this room, there's a physical quantity that can be measured by one real number.

Which is temperature?

And it's a temperature field a scalar field that varies with time, so the subconscious is actually analogous to a temperature Field 'cause. It has location. There's the visual part, the auditory part, the emotional body part and so forth.
