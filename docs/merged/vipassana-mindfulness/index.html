<p>If we look at the etymology that is to say the origin of the word Vipasana.</p>
<p>We can analyze it into the Prefix V.</p>
<p>And the word plus enough posener means seeing it comes from the root pus in Poly or push in Sanskrit, which means to see Pusha T is to see.</p>
<p>And although it might not be immediately evident actually that route in Sanskrit Pusha T is related both to the Latin Spec array. Spec, which means to see Spec becomes splash becomes push in Sanskrit and it's related to the Greek scope skepsis that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Essentia Lee, the car sound of Indoeuropean can sometimes become a share sound in Sanskrit, so that's how you get Spec becoming splash, becoming push an V has.</p>
<p>Several meanings it's actually derived from V.</p>
<p>And we is the same route that gives us duo or the English word 2, which is really 12 right TW Oh so the DV and the TW.</p>
<p>Are the indoeuropean root? That means 2:00 or separate or apart so the corresponding Greek word? Is dia di IA? Which would have been pronounced dia in ancient Greek if you look at how dia is used in forming words in English. Dia has a meaning of through.</p>
<p>For example, diathermy is to send heat through a person as a healing modality on the other hand. Dia also means apart or separate for example, a diagnosis is to know separately. Ortenau distinctly a diacritic is a distinguishing mark something that allows you to separate similar things so.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the corresponding word incense or the corresponding prefix in Sanskrit V.</p>
<p>Means those 2 things it means both separate.</p>
<p>And through so literally vipasa not would mean to see separately.</p>
<p>But it would also mean to see through.</p>
<p>So see separately in my interpretation is the ability to separate the basic sensory elements of experience which I like to classify in terms of touch sight sound feel image and talk. I've described the meanings of those elsewhere, so the person not in the sense of separate sensory.</p>
<p>Elements we can also have even finer separations different flavors of field can be separated different flavors of touch. You can distinguish different kinds of images images that are of People places versus objects. And so forth so to separate the sensory strands is one meaning of V plus or not to see separate.</p>
<p>But we personal also means to see through that means that.</p>
<p>Once you separate a strand you intently focus on that strand and your awareness sort of soaks into its interstices and that has the effect of.</p>
<p>Causing it to soften dissolve.</p>
<p>So that it shows you it's empty and vibrant nature that seeing through or soaking in aspect also has the effect of.</p>
<p>Reaching down into the subliminal neural circuitry into the unconscious itself, so that there's a kind of trickle down of clarity bound to the depths of.</p>
<p>Ones subconscious levels of processing so I take vipasana to mean the 2:00 fold. Endeavour of separating strands and then soaking into those strands and literally seeing through their something that's</p>
<p>Now the person are also.</p>
<p>Has a third meaning the V can be combined with person ought to mean insight In other words, the haha or wisdom experience. The change in paradigm.</p>
<p>That we call.</p>
<p>No self or insight into the marks of existence or enlightenment that change in paradigm that wisdom or insight.</p>
<p>Is also implied by the word rip us enough so vipasana means?</p>
<p>Separate as I'd like to interpret it anyway, it means separate see apart.</p>
<p>See through and see into your true nature or insight and it has all three of those meanings. In one word so we don't have anything like it in English. There's no English equivalent. There's no word in English. That means separate your sensory experience into natural components soak your awareness into those components and as the result of that you will experience a paradigm.</p>
<p>Shift called Wisdom Vipasana means all of that as one word.</p>
<p>So, in my usage, I Essentia Lee Usvi personal and mindfulness as synonyms now strictly speaking. Historically, the word mindfulness goes back to suti or such a Patana goes back to a different word, but really the notions are in my way of thinking are.</p>
<p>Essentia Lee, the same, the way I like to set up my definition of mindfulness involves the separating the soaking into which I call the sensory clarity.</p>
<p>Of course in order to do that, you have to have concentration power and then.</p>
<p>The equanimity piece is not implied by the word. Repulsa not etymologically. But in terms of practical practical considerations. All mindfulness teachers emphasize this sort of gentle matter-of-fact sometimes it's defined as non judgmental. That's not the term. I use but I prefer the more traditional equanimity term, but all vipasana teachers emphasize.</p>
<p>That, In addition to the clarification aspects, so that's sort of how I understand the terminology.</p>
