<p>To come to this practice.</p>
<p>And we'll be talking about this practice will be talking about the concepts that you need for this practice and will be giving you a chance to do the techniques that will develop the core skills of this practice.</p>
<p>You already know the big picture. We do this for our self and we do this for others. People go through a certain education process in school and usually at the end of school. It's OK. I'm sort of done the education piece.</p>
<p>So life is sort of a school for People.</p>
<p>And at some point, most People reach a point where they have the perception well, I've sort of.</p>
<p>You know, I'm.</p>
<p>I've grown as.</p>
<p>As much as I need to grow.</p>
<p>I'm an adult I'm established I've got this, or that.</p>
<p>I don't need a radical new something I completed my education.</p>
<p>But some People mature to the point where they realize that there's one more.</p>
<p>Level.</p>
<p>I'm learning as a human that is available if you want to.</p>
<p>That's</p>
<p>Watt, each and everyone of you has reached you've reached that point of maturity where you're ready for sort of the last.</p>
<p>Muscle.</p>
<p>For the human you had to go through a lot of different lessons.</p>
<p>But the last lesson is the one that.</p>
<p>Is designed to?</p>
<p>Bring you to total happiness.</p>
<p>Happiness.</p>
<p>Then.</p>
<p>Is?</p>
<p>Dependent on conditions, but also to a happiness that is independent of conditions.</p>
<p>For yourself and for others this might be called total happiness so this is the continuing education.</p>
<p>That we came here to get.</p>
<p>And I want to congratulate each and everyone of you for.</p>
<p>Being that old that adult that you reached the point where you're ready to do what few People are actually ready to do at this point in human history.</p>
<p>Things were different in the past and things will probably be different in the future but recently.</p>
<p>The last many thousands of years is recently rather few humans have reached this point but you have.</p>
<p>That's extraordinary.</p>
<p>Add.</p>
<p>It will be my privilege my joy.</p>
<p>To facilitate this process for you.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Jazz.</p>
<p>Ready to go.</p>
<p>And we're going to have a great week, thank you.</p>
