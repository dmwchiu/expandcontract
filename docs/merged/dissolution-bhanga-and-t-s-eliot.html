<p>That in the Pali language is called Ponge BHA NGA.</p>
<p>Polly is an ancient Indian language.</p>
<p>The one in which the earliest Buddhist writings are preserved.</p>
<p>Hunger means dissolution.</p>
<p>Literally and it's reported all over the world. It is by no means distinctive to Buddhist practice. In fact, it's pretty central to a lot of show monic.</p>
<p>Paths in different tribal cultures, the dissolution or Bungay experience has 2 sides to it.</p>
<p>On one hand it can be unbelievably blissful.</p>
<p>Because your whole body dissolves into Champagne Bubbles is pleasant Vibra Tori, Enerji. They're not just your whole body your whole body in your whole mind. Or maybe even not just your body and your mind. But even your external senses of sight and sound all dissolved into a Champagne Enerji. It's like having a bubble bath. It's like being massage, dry by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>It's like the cosmic parents are holding you embracing you stretching you and squeezing you and loving ways that totally fulfill you.</p>
<p>That's the.</p>
<p>Heavenly side too.</p>
<p>The dissolution experience.</p>
<p>Now, Having said that you might be saying, Gee I hope I get that someday well first of all. You don't have to have that kind of experience in order to gain insight in purification and Secondly there is another side.</p>
<p>The side that is not heavenly.</p>
<p>Decide that</p>
<p>Hopefully will be purgatorial.</p>
<p>And hopefully will not be hellish.</p>
<p>Purgatory and hell are very different theologically speaking.</p>
<p>Purgatory is a temporary place where you are purified consciousness is purified and every minute that you spend in Purgatory. Although it may be uncomfortable is a moment that takes you closer and closer to heaven.</p>
<p>The beatific vision.</p>
<p>Hell is a place of pointless suffering doesn't lead you anywhere purgatory definitely has a goal and there's a silver lining too.</p>
<p>The cloud you might say.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Sometimes the experience of dissolution can be purgatorial.</p>
<p>It can seem as though you're being torn apart. You can be terrified. It can seem as though you have no firm ground to stand on and there are horrific painful mental images images of death and destruction. In classical shamanic cultures. This sometimes takes the form of animals eating you up the whole thing in some ways like being sick.</p>
<p>Of the hellish sorry the rather the purgatorial side of dissolution and in fact, in traditional African cultures.</p>
<p>This stage is often associated with actual physical illness from which the shaman recovers and then has knows their vocation as server of humanity.</p>
<p>There is</p>
<p>Exactly 4 possibilities.</p>
<p>Some People do the path without any dissolution. Some People do the path with.</p>
<p>The heavenly kind of dissolution. Some People do the path with the purgatorial kind of disillusioned and some People do the path. There's a mixture of the heavenly and the purgatory.</p>
<p>My favorite poet is TS Eliot, he pulls no punches apparently for him.</p>
<p>Abanga did not have much of the wistful aspect that I've described as I said it's different for different People and you have to just accept some People don't have dissolution experiences. Some People like blissful ones. Some People have horrific ones, and some People have a mixture of the 2:00 seems if we can if we just based on? What Elliot had to say that his was much more purgatorial in.</p>
<p>Part of the four quartets, he compares.</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p>To being sick and he compares the action of the Trinity.</p>
<p>To a surgeon that would be the sun and to a nurse that was the Holy Spirit and to the owner of the hospital. Just God, the father remember that, Elliot was a was a traditional.</p>
<p>High church Anglican very conservative Christian.</p>
<p>He thought of his job as not trying to convince people of Christianity through poetry.</p>
<p>You didn't think that was the poets job the poets job.</p>
<p>If there are Christian poet is to allow People to experience what it's like to be a Christian.</p>
<p>Even if they may not be Christians. You can experience what it feels like to be a Christian.</p>
<p>In his case a form of Catholic Christian Church of England. You can experience what it's like to be that even though you might not believe in that by reading his poetry and that's why I like. His poetry because, although I wouldn't say that I buy into the belief system of that path. I really appreciate that by reading him. I can experience what it's like to be somebody on that path so I'm going to read.</p>
<p>For you, a little section how the Holy Spirit, which is the Christian term for the activity of impermanence how the Holy Spirit acts on you in order to rip apart. There's something is an innocence kill you.</p>
<p>But kill you in the sense of.</p>
<p>Dissolving the something Ness of self within you so that there's nothing in between you and the beatific vision which is their word for the direct experience of the source.</p>
<p>The Woon did surgeon plies the steel that questions. The distempered part beneath the bleeding hands, we feel the sharp compassion of the healers art.</p>
<p>Resolving the enigma of the Fever chart are only health is the disease. If we obey the dying nurse whose constant care is not to please but to remind of our atoms curse.</p>
<p>And that to be restored our sickness must grow worse. The whole earth is our hospital endowed by the ruined millionaire in which if we do well, we shall die?</p>
<p>Of the absolute parental care, which will not leave us but prevents us everywhere the chill ascends from feet to knees a fever, sings in mental wires if to be warmed then I must freeze and quake in frigid purgatorial fires in which the flame is roses.</p>
<p>And the smoke is Briar.</p>
<p>The dripping blood are only drink the bloody flesh are only food in spite of which we like to think that we are sound substantial flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>In spite of that.</p>
<p>We call this Friday good.</p>
