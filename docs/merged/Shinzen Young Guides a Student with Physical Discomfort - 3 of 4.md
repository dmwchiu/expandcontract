How's that coming right?

It really slowed so it was almost stopped, but then I noticed it was moved.

When it stopped was there a deep tranquility within you.

Or it's just stopped it will serve sort of after.

Afterglow.

Or not, and you know it was more like the pulsing kind of although the Pulsing is kind of still flow, but it was not the gentle.

Flow it kind of took over for a bit OK, there was looking for that, gentle flow.

And then it sort of showed up again.

Excellent very clear report.

And you're continuing to be able to experience the flow as.

After pleasant kind of soothing thing so.

You're essentially experiencing widespread Poison Ivy as a soothing.

Flow of energy is that true.

I have to say yes, it is.

And yet we did nothing.

Other than focus on just what is?

So that's pretty weird.

OK, I'm assuming it's mostly in your arms that we've been focusing is that correct or if you've been focusing wherever the Poison Ivy inches are.

I was focusing on on the flow and I have to say that it sort of wine into my app domain as well. Like sort of involved my torso in my arms is just spread In other words that is a characteristic overflow experience.

I'd like you to see how widespread within your body you can find phenomenon that could come under the category of flow.

There could be tingling or waving in your legs.

Your arms your torso your face.

Expansion and contraction inward pressures outgrew pressures see how wide spread through your body.

You can find things that might come under that category.

This sort of take an inventory through the body.



Yeah, now that I've sort of opened up my search. It is all over. It's fairly global in the body. I'd like you to.

Zoom out and cover your whole body with awareness and focus in on the flow.

As encompassing your whole body that's excellent sometimes, this is the way it happens.



It's funny isn't it whoever do that.

Severe Poison Ivy could be so much fun who would have ever thunk it.

And you're particularly sensitive to the Poison Ivy is that correct it seems I cannot deny that I am very sensitive to it.

Where you doing, great work?



Able to get that sense that your whole body is sort of flowing yes. Now we're going to up the challenge level considerably.

I'd like you to keep your awareness in the body.

And if possible on the flow.

That I'd like you to open your eyes but sort of defocus your eyes try to just sort of softap focus so you're not too drawn into external sites.

And see if it's possible to maintain some contact with that flow with your eyes open.

The opening of the ice could intensify the flow it could.

Cause the flow to so to become less where it might have no effect at all.

But does this instruction makes sense.

Good I like you to try that.

Able to maintain some sense of that with your eyes open.



Some sense of it, the pulse kind asserted itself again.

But there's still a bit of a presence of the flow, as well. Even with your eyes open, yeah that's fantastic.

So this shows you that you can maintain this in life. It doesn't have to be just the rot when your eyes are closed necessarily you could maintain it as you're going about daily life. You might be able to maintain some sense of it awareness of that flow throughout the day that makes sense. At least as a theoretical possibility good, I'd like you to close your eyes again.

And.

I'd like you to bring your attention to your mind for a moment.

We're going to go out of the body.

Bring your attention to the area in front of behind your closed eyes sort of your mental screen does that make sense.



If we were to ignore mental images and colors that might be there would be left with dark brighter. Grey is it mostly dark for you, mostly bright or mostly Gray.

Mostly dark.

I'd like you to focus on how the pattern of dark and bright is changing their constantly changing does that make sense.

It is moving right.

Better.

Big dark brightness.

Is that correct?

Moving I mean, like shifting it, perhaps in very small ways or that's not the case.

It's yeah, moving in the sense that some of those bright spots are fading and then coming back and that's what I mean will consider that to be flow. Inside that blank so I'd like you to note that as flow. And if there is any vibration inside the blank. The dark for example, if there's any like bubbly or whatever number that is flow also.

Somebody sounds,

Actually, no could you say that again well when you look at the darkness brightness behind your closed eyes. It could be perfectly stable or it could be moving in, some way.

Would you say it's perfectly stable or there's this movement of some sort there?

There's movement will call that movement float does that make sense and I'd like you to just focus on how the visual phenomenon their flow.

And if you happen to have any mental pictures of things.

If they move or change or melt or morph will consider that flow also so we're going to sort of look at flow inside, either your mental blank screen or any mental pictures that might be present now of course, there might be times when there is no flow. Everything might be perfectly stable so only note flow if something changes, if it doesn't change them, then just.

Stay there and that things be stable.
