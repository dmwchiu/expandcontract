So equanimity sounds like being cooled out and attached but actually as we would define it in the mindfulness tradition. It's radical non interference with the natural flow of sensory experience, so if you have.

Emotions in the body you don't push them down. But you don't latch on to them inappropriately either. It's a sort of non pushing and pulling a hands off. With regards to the flow of your senses which does not for a moment imply a hands off. With regards to the flow of events in the world. You can be very, very proactive and even pushy with regards to.

Circumstances and conditions, but equanimity means that you're not pushing and pulling the natural operation of your senses your sense is defined as external site external sound physical type body sensations meant your mental images your internal talk and your emotional body sensations. You'd let touch sight sound feel image talk expanded contract as they wish without interference. Let me just make sure.

I get that right so equanimity is my experience.

Thoughts and feelings and body sensation.

How I'm experiencing the world in terms of sight and sound I'm just letting that?

Happen in watching that kind of flow. I don't know like waves or something but that's separate from my wanting to do an action in the world to change things. Yes, In other words, as you become passive innocence. With regards to in the sense that you're passive in the sense that you don't fight yourself. Your train another way to look at equanimity is its trading your sensory circuits, not to interfere with themselves so you could compare it to.

If your sensory experience is the engine of a car equanimity is oiling. The engine so the parts don't grind against each other, causing being in the weo that we're going for it can lead to an experience of Fluidity, but sometimes it can lead to an experience of solidity because you're willing to let things melt and freeze. There's another TS. This is going to be TS Eliot time there's another TS Eliot Line.

Mid Winter Spring is its own season.

Between melting and freezing the soles SAP quivers. You have to be willing to melt an freeze the equanimity is equanimity with whatever form the senses take, but what equanimity does is it's a skill.

Yeah, so it's another way to look at it is. It's learning to love every sensory experience as it arises but not to hold onto it inappropriately as it passes? How do you develop that skill I'd like that one everyone would because it's a good skill? Yeah, it's a good skill points, all have some equanimity.

I concur and why it's a good skill is you'll discover that when you have equanimity with pain. It still hurts but it doesn't bother you and when you have equanimity with pleasure. It not only feels good. It satisfies you. People think they want to be free from pain and to have pleasure. But what they really want is to be free from pain being a problem and to have pleasure that gives satisfaction and it turns out that the quality of equanimity.

Does that so when you say yeah? I'd like? Yeah, it's like that joke it's like? I'd like to have like, she's having yeah well. That's the equanimity is definitely something that People desirable highly desirable and effect. More than desirable may be absolutely essential. If you have some physical and or emotional pain that cannot be gotten rid of by changing circumstances or biannual jesiah.

Or psychotropics or whatever, then you've got a choice of either developing equanimity or being mired in abject suffering.

So definitely equanimity is not only desirable it may be pivotal to making a life worth living under certain circumstances.
