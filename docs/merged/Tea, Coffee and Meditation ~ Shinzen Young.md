It is certainly historically the case that the custom of drinking tea was introduced from China into Japan and Association with Zen.

And it was the Song Dynasty style of making tea, which is the.

Power T Benson was done a matcha their little Japanese pronunciation that came in with the initial introduction of Zen at that same period that I was talking about in Japan and the twelve 13th century and so forth.

However, China had had T prior to that and I don't know to what extent it was drunk in Japan.

I mean, everybody says that came in in the common area period was from China but T. It goes back at least as far as the Tang Dynasty. But in the Tang Dynasty. They made it into bricks sounds like a boot of break and I guess you pull apart like chopping right there very expensive. Then they come from actually not too far from where?

Phillips ancestors come from South China and it's called that that that that happens like somebody will tell you that this is like $2000, you both may break team.

But then later on in the main main kind state.

I never closely researched the history, but I've heard sort of.

Anecdotally that coffee for filled the same role in the Islamic Sufi meditative tradition. As the Machado get for example, at after I feel better since that's really true.

OK, good.
