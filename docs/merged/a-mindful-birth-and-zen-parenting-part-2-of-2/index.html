<p>That's your monastery.</p>
<p>So the source.</p>
<p>Blasts you away in birthday and then expects you to function immediately and big time. So, just function. You become it's like saying, you get blown away in your sons and interview and then you have to go to a job. But there's no you left so you just do the job you become the activity.</p>
<p>We just function I ventured instead your aunties in interviews with the Zen master right mostly what you go for in an interview. People think they're going to solve these koans like what's the sound of one hand, clapping things and then you are, but mostly you're going to have an experience of merging with the expansion contraction and emptiness of that send master so they sort of like.</p>
<p>Some of their dynamic nothingness rubs off on you each time you do sunset in an interview and then you carry that back to the Meditation Bowl.</p>
<p>That's how that works and then but then, unlike the shock Top that the Hindus do where you sort of get zapped and then you just sort of sing rock. They sit around and seeing and worship. The grew and have some grub and then you get this app. And then you gotta go bust your *** in the meditation. All and it's cold and they're beating their yelling at you, you got to apply it right. This like you may think you got some enerji or picked up something well. Now let's see if you could use it with your aching legs and your aching.</p>
<p>Psyche you know in the Senate torture chamber now will see did you really get it and of course? Why that's so cool is that then you're not a leaky capacitor that just like gets charged and then loses it. You would develop the strength. You could hold that and you don't become dependent on the feature for that Energi.</p>
<p>So because you're forced to use it. You're forced to be strong. It's not just OK. We're going to let the groove is you know ZAP us and then.</p>
<p>Sit around and talk about how great the blue is you have to like apply it to real stuff right away so that's why I like this and approach to it. They talk about transferring the consciousness, but not in quite explicitly the terms. I'm using with your mom. So you go. You pick up something of the dynamic nothingness of that.</p>
<p>Roshi.</p>
<p>And then you carry it back the way I look at Zen parenting using Zen here and also metaphorical is that your baby is the Zen Master.</p>
<p>Because the baby is dynamic nothingness.</p>
<p>It's still linked to the source so every time you're interacting with the baby.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>You're having is an interview.</p>
<p>That's your little Roshi OK.</p>
<p>And you can see the flow of expansion contraction.</p>
<p>And 0 inside the baby and it rubs off on you.</p>
<p>So you're getting shot depart from their own baby.</p>
<p>Food dot sight sound.</p>
<p>Then you right on that and you're able to use it for the challenges of taking care of the baby.</p>
<p>That's the way one way to think about the parenting.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>It's pretty cool very cool, yeah, any questions about any of this.</p>
<p>You've talked about unforgiving at all price it correctly, but sometimes we will.</p>
<p>Like the raw.</p>
<p>Fear will come up and you. You said it's like an infant state of fear does that mean I understand what you're talking about and I really appreciate you bringing that up.</p>
<p>Because I've had an experience like that.</p>
<p>And now it gives me so much compassion when a baby cries or gets upset and we may or may not know why that is.</p>
<p>But by me experiencing that and by you.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>Letting me know that that's the wrong feel emotion than an infant fields. I think it will let me have a lot more love and compassion.</p>
<p>For that child when they experience something like that.</p>
<p>Let me ask you I want to make sure I know what we're talking about is it having the experience of a sort of like chaotic activity within field space inside yourself like you dropped into a very primitive level and there was just sort of like.</p>
<p>Chaotic feel for no particular reason just sort of like enemy by.</p>
<p>Doing nothing deep down there is that what you're alluding to yes, but it was, it was, it was a huge chaotic fear and just fear or was it other sensations. Mixed yeah, I think it was just fear but it was really big and then I just went grasping for an image or something to equate how big that fear was to something that I could identify with and it was terrible.</p>
<p>Criminal situation is the image that just came in my in my mind. That's how big the fear was, but it was just the theater at the beginning, so you experience like raw fear in field space for no reason whatsoever, no and it was just like a chaotic arising and.</p>
<p>When you apply the practice to that.</p>
<p>Think back it was a couple retreats ago.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I applied for practice or not I think I was just shocked because you were shocked at how how primitive and irrational field space right right. But now you know that when you watch the baby so doing it stuff that's it's feel space, expanding or contracting so this gives you a sense of that. You have an experiential sense of what the baby is going through when it's in the it's sort of.</p>
<p>Primordial freak out. Yes yes and instead of you know going what's wrong with you know it's like all of a sudden there's a huge amount of compassion because of what I experienced.</p>
<p>Well, that's a excellent.</p>
<p>When time gets closer to that event like probably like to talk to you about it about the birthing process sure again. You have left me with a lot of excitement and.</p>
<p>I was on another retreat with you when someone went into a big labor on it online and then went to the hospital and she came back and described it during the talking circle. I think she was in labor for a huge amount of time and she she talked about how the nurses and doctors were completely shocked and how she was in labor for so long and they were amazed at how well she she did it was.</p>
<p>Absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>This is</p>
<p>So I think we're good? Yes yes.</p>
