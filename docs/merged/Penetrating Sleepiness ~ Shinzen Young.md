Before the sleepiness stuff well read and Reread until you master completely what I have to say in the blog from Fuzz 2. Fuzz that that's on the Internet and that's the brain dump of everything that I know for how to work with sinking SNKING, so syncing is the generic term for anything.

From getting a little hazy in your consciousness to the Zen lurch and the snoring in this end, though, and so forth that whole continuum. We called sinking kanji in Japanese means con means dark and gin means to.

Seemed down to the bottom of the pond so kanji and is like sinking in English, so for syncing over and over again straight in the spine over and over again for see eyes open over and over again enjoy the pleasant rest fullness of the waves of sleeping us over and over again. E quantum eyes. The discomfort of the sleeping us and you just keep doing that and doing that. In doing that and I know it's hard to believe that I certainly didn't believe it but.

You can eventually penetrate the sensory event of sleepiness and when you do that, then the.

A sensory experience, then there's the object of circumstance of.

You know your wilting your lurching and your breathing heavily etc. When you penetrate these sensory event of sleepiness. Then the object if aspects of the sleepiness. The laws of consciousness that impact on the posture and the fact that you start to make noise that all gets cleared up. I remember one of my early retreats in Japan.

Of course I was dominated by the.

A pain of the sitting and I went to talk to the person that was like leading the retreat and he said well.

Uh I've been meditating with him talking I've been meditating now for 25 years and you know the.

Eventually, the pain breaks up.

Um.

Uh but then he said sleepiness is is very hard to deal with the pain is going to break up. But sleepiness may continue to be a challenge well now that conversation took place 40 years ago.

And I can tell you that the sleepiness breaks up to.

Um just keep working and working and working and you see improvements in that regard.
