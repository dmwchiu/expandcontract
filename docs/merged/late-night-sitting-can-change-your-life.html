<p>And it's a tradition at a lot of retreats. I give a whole talk about strategies for doing it. And why People do it, so maybe I can give you the executive summary.</p>
<p>At night, there's an altar alternation of brain chemistry that occurs and that can sort of give you an interesting perspective from which to the practice different themes tend to come up for one thing each wave of Sleepiness Induces, a wave of rest that's why People lurch because.</p>
<p>Actually, what's happening is this physical relaxation, so you can get into a rhythm where if you happen to be sleeping. You won't necessarily be sleepy, but you may be at some point sleepy? What happens is is that you notice how the sleepiness comes in waves.</p>
<p>And each wave will tend to cause the body to physically relax and it could also cause see rest and heuristic but turn off the mental talk and it could cause either bright light or darkness. Sort of undifferentiated visual experience so at least feel rest and perhaps also see rest in here rest get.</p>
<p>Triggered.</p>
<p>Rhythmically by rhythmic waves of sleepiness now if you can sort of get into that. Rhythm then what happens is your reengineering the experience of sleeping us into the experience of meditative absorption because there's something if you've read about if you read sort of the Dharma or Buddhist scholasticism. There's something called the Bhavanga Sota, Buffalo.</p>
<p>Hunger sorta so above our means existence on Guardians support.</p>
<p>Or underpinning and so timing stream So what is the Pomona soda? Well, that's the boundary zone between conscious the conscious mind in the unconscious mind now in meditative absorption.</p>
<p>And in falling asleep and in dying in those 3 circumstances. We dip below the pavona soda so there's an intimate link between those 3 things and.</p>
<p>The ability to.</p>
<p>Drop below the Bellagio so to and not lose consciousness is a big deal. In fact to live and function below the befunge soda is too.</p>
<p>Is to solve the Co op that I'm going to give you?</p>
<p>Actually, I just gave away the answer moving like ordinary life.</p>
<p>Below the stream of existence would mean that you're alive in the on board. You're functioning from the Apple so all mine sitting is.</p>
<p>An opportunity to explore dipping below that boundary. So now if you dip. Unconsciously then you're going to have the Zen lurch OK. But if you get into the rhythm that I'm describing it will just take you deeper and deeper on the see if I can remember.</p>
<p>I need your some.</p>
<p>I need your shema weather be here.</p>
<p>That's how you say it in Hebrew and learn that last time in Israel. I need I you should not sleep?</p>
<p>Velopex and or but my heart. My consciousness ear is awake. I sleep with my heart wake. If it's from the Psalms. The Latin is a go demeo said. Kortmann vigilant and that was used as an ideal by the Christian monks in the Middle Ages when Latin was the language that was used the.</p>
<p>Canonical hours that the monks keep which we still have remnants in our language in words like Magina and noon OK. It's known as the 9th hour, etc, etc. Mattens is the afternoon law, making the morning logs. I can't remember there's there's a certain set number of hours that.</p>
<p>Mouse kept an very few orders still do this, but a few do, and essentially it's like a radical disruption of the sleeping cycle because they never get more than a few hours sleep and then they have to go to the.</p>
<p>The Chapel and either do chanting or singing or have a liturgy of some sort or mass or something and I think it's like 7 times in a 24 hour cycle. So it's like waking up in the middle of the night while sleeping all the time lifestyle thing. It never varies ever. So what's that all about why be sleeping, all the time.</p>
<p>Why I never get any continuous sleep for your whole life well?</p>
<p>For that reason, Eggo Dormael said Cormier visually you learn how to bring consciousness into.</p>
<p>Sleep. So it's not sleep anymore. What is it well in Christianity. It was called infused contemplation but in Buddhism. It's called Formless JAMA?</p>
<p>So one way to go about that. That's used in them and obviously also was used in Christianity is to re engineer. The sleepiness thing so one facet is you can write it into these delicious restful states. Of course takes a little practice like a lot of practice. So I'm not guaranteeing that you will experience I sleep, but my heart makers.</p>
<p>And tomorrow morning be in light that live the rest of your life in the unborn but you can take some sort of step in that direction.</p>
<p>No, I'm sort of convincing myself that I should join.</p>
<p>Look at oceans do it, she started that she knew this was she was shaking her head. You would before she was like convincing myself and I want to do this. Well, now, you probably think I'm a whip right that I can't do it well prove it slightly army. Sir could you do that you're supposed to be able to ask your?</p>
<p>Sergeant to do anything he asks you to do is etc, etc. But not really convincing myself well. The truth is, you deserve my a game tomorrow, which may not manifest.</p>
<p>If I'm too sleep deprived I can still function, but maybe not the A game function OK so.</p>
<p>But other things come up it's not just explore the restful states you may never get mental image as well at 3:00 in the morning. Maybe you have met all my pitches. Dreamscape starts to replace the landscape that could be well. I never space is never available to me well. Maybe it'll be available at 3:00 this morning, so that could be a little window of opportunity, the world is solid well at 3:00 in the morning.</p>
<p>Maybe it won't be so solid as your eyes swim now. You might say well. That's ******** because that's just you know you're just tired and that's an optical illusion, but it's also a place to stand to explore visual experience. And if you do an awful lot of that it will give you insight into the impermanent nature of C out.</p>
<p>That's there when you're quite recovered and looking quite normally at the world. You still have this knowledge of flow within that experience so not a whole lot of interesting things can happen as the result of the Aza so there are reasons to do it. There is also of course, we can sometimes be comfortable physically there's this sticky.</p>
<p>Crawley sort of.</p>
<p>Like yucky I think on your face right coagulate. It yucky and a sort of excruciating yawning us, but just sits in your chest hour after hour after hour and then there could be all sorts of emotions that come up because we're in.</p>
<p>We're a little non Compus Mentis, I mean, it is the classic way to break People down right with brain washing and so forth. So now I'm giving he really kind of sales pitches. It comes to buy this product.</p>
<p>However, the People that are committed to this practice now that there is such a thing. There is a thing called working through stuff.</p>
<p>And the same process that breaks People down.</p>
<p>Also can break People up.</p>
<p>If you follow the distinction Ah to be broken down is a disempowering experience of abuse to be broken up is an empowering experience of abuse broken down. It means you're like shattered glass broken up your Apple Marty or like.</p>
<p>Spray of pure.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Steam.</p>
<p>That now joins the flow of nature forever.</p>
<p>So anyway.</p>
<p>So I didn't intend to talk about yasa, but</p>
<p>Oh let me just give those of you that are have never done. It first timers going to give you a reality check? How many people in this room have done on all night, said.</p>
<p>How many people in this room have done it again? So you can see this is not like Oh my God? No one could do this kind of **** kind of thing right so that's that's why as a rap extemporize.</p>
