<p>Ordinary sense reactivity.</p>
<p>That would be touch sight sound feel image talk.</p>
<p>These categories naturally organize themselves into certain subsystems.</p>
<p>I mentioned in another segment that feel image talk.</p>
<p>Is both a reactive and proactive system?</p>
<p>By reactive I mean when you hear a sound or you're aware of a site or something physically impacts. Your body it may or may not trigger a mental comment. It may or may not trigger a mental picture. It may or may not trigger an emotional sensation in your body if it triggers 1, two or all three of those then I say that there has been.</p>
<p>Afit reaction of feel image or talk reaction to the IT of the touch sight or sound and it turns out that you can monitor.</p>
<p>How your sense of subjective self the sense of being a perceiver?</p>
<p>You can monitor how that sense of self arises through different levels of activation of feel image talk in the most extreme case when feel image and talk. All three activate very strongly in response to an external stimulus of some sort you will typically get a very strong sense of an eye that is perceiving it over there.</p>
<p>However, as you're monitoring feel image talk. It could happen spontaneously every once in awhile that there is a touch for a side or a sound and it doesn't produce any reaction in this system whatsoever. When that happens, you have little or no sense of a perceiving self inside of you and if you monitor those fluctuations repeat this kind of experiment over and over again, you can get.</p>
<p>Haha experience or an inside experience into the mechanism whereby the sense of I am Nahs. At least in the sense of a perceiving self arises. You can have an intense reaction of feel image talk. But if there's a lot of clarity, so that you keep those components untangled and if there's a lot of equanimity, which means that those components are completely unblocked there's no.</p>
<p>Suppressing of their arising but there's no inappropriate holding on to them once they have arisen.</p>
<p>That's equanimity if there's enough clarity and equanimity even though you would have a huge fit storm. A huge storm of emotionality in the body visual mental associations and judgmental chatter in your head.</p>
<p>That doesn't turn into.</p>
<p>Are self?</p>
<p>It only turns into a self when there's unconsciousness and coagulations or fixation of the field image talk reactions.</p>
<p>That's what I meant when I said that these categories can bring insights.</p>
<p>As you're observing.</p>
<p>Now, not only is feel image talk a reactive system. It's also proactive system when it's not reacting to touch sight sound or some combination thereof, it usually goes off, and begins to spin memory plan fantasy problem solving worrying confusion, etc, etc.</p>
<p>Neuro scientists now know about this and call it the default attentional system. It's being studied.</p>
<p>But I call it proactive fit.</p>
<p>Proactive in the sense that it's not reacting to the environment. It's just going off and spinning past future and fantasy. Basically, A plus problem solving and then every once in awhile as I mentioned the fit system.</p>
<p>Is not reactive? It's not proactive? It just spontaneously goes inactive then there's just peace?</p>
<p>Blank quiet the body is emotionally peaceful mental screen is blank. The head is quiet if you happen to notice the moment that that occurs which may be very fleeting you will get what we call insight into no self now of course, there are some other natural systems here.</p>
<p>We can take.</p>
<p>Touch field to be your body experience. The ordinary side of your body experience. Then there's also a restful system in your body which is physical relaxation and emotional piece, emotional piece is defined as tangible awareness that your emotional centers are not. Active there in a restful state. There idling so to speak so this gives a system of ordinary experience in the body.</p>
<p>And restful experience in the body then your mental experience is here, your visual thoughts and your auditory thoughts. So this is the ordinary side image talk activity. However, there's a restful system in your mind, which is blank quiet.</p>
<p>The.</p>
<p>Sense of outer world of sights and sounds well. That's here.</p>
<p>The corresponding restful states are silence and the D focusing of your eyes, the soft focus with your eyes open, which I call light.</p>
<p>One of the themes that I have People work with is different systems of ordinary experience. For example, they could focus in and just work with feel image talk or they could focus out and just work with touch sight sound.</p>
<p>Or other combinations.</p>
<p>And I call that theme focus on ordinary.</p>
<p>Then by way of contrast, you can work with various restful systems including the whole thing at once. You could just let your attention freely float among whatever restful states were available, physical relaxation, emotional piece in the body mental blank saw focus of your eyes and if there happened to be quiet or silence around you. You would have an auditory component to the rest the restful states.</p>
<p>Are what most People who don't meditate think meditation? Is an certainly releasing stress and recharging your battery through enjoying restful experience? Is is an important component in the meditative in Denver and that's why I give People these various restful systems to work on and I call that the theme of exploring rest, however.</p>
<p>Within the mindfulness tradition, taking ordinary experience and making it extraordinary by working with it.</p>
<p>Using high concentration sensory clarity and equanimity that's also important.</p>
<p>Way of practicing and it's good because if you want to focus on rest. But you can't. They'll be a reason. The reason is there's too much activity well, then you can focus on the activity on the other hand, sometimes People run into this situation where when they practice. Not much is coming up so in that case? How do you keep the edge of clarity and therefore the edge of growth while I say?</p>
<p>When nothing much is happening as you're sitting there 6 things are happening your body is physically relaxed your bodies emotionally peaceful your mental screen is blank your head is quiet your eyes are defocused and your ears are defocused so you're having 6 restful experiences all at once by being aware of that. That brings the clarity component into the experience of rest and that clarity component.</p>
<p>Guarantees that they'll be growth in your practice that you won't get stuck in a good place of just mellowing out year after year without gaining insight and purification.</p>
