<p>So what prompted me to bring up that koan was.</p>
<p>This little fellow here OK because I can't think of a better iconic representation of enlightenment than this OK, there, we go.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's fun isn't it, it is fun. Why is it fun? Why do we don't like watching this there is a reason and it's called Helmholtz free energy?</p>
<p>I'm reasonably sure.</p>
<p>I would say that.</p>
<p>We all.</p>
<p>Ride.</p>
<p>On.</p>
<p>A kind of effortless.</p>
<p>Just happening nahs.</p>
<p>That is the nature of consciousness so.</p>
<p>When I say the word emptiness.</p>
<p>Within say the Buddhist context.</p>
<p>What image comes to your mind?</p>
<p>Well, maybe an image of vastness.</p>
<p>I would say that's not incorrect, but it's exactly half the picture.</p>
<p>I think for a lot of People when they hear Buddhists talk about emptiness. The image that comes to their mind is some sort of.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Some sort of Bleakness.</p>
<p>It's like.</p>
<p>You bust your buns for 40 years on the cushion and what do you have to show for it emptiness?</p>
<p>Maybe that's another rabbi in Rochie joke the road, she says. We we attain emptiness Rabbi says.</p>
<p>That's Garmisch OK, you have to know your dish garnished means means Bob 'cause. It means that once that's nothing OK. OK, however, when I when I first encountered the word emptiness I was.</p>
<p>A student of Buddhism academically.</p>
<p>Company in Tibetan shown Italian Sanskrit Cone in Mandarin Chinese cool and sino Japanese I knew it in many Asian languages.</p>
<p>It was just as weird idea that I didn't have any image of it's like what the heck.</p>
<p>As I say a lot of People probably think of Bleakness.</p>
<p>So People think of vastness.</p>
<p>But the reason I so like this little charge for that Charlie brought is.</p>
<p>For many, many years.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Now, when I use the word emptiness and when I hear the word emptiness within the Buddhist context.</p>
<p>This is exactly what my images bouncing us springiness.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>In 1660, Robert Boyle wrote foundational work.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>On pressure and the year later, you wrote a foundational work on chemistry, which it it's interesting Lee. He called the skeptical chemist.</p>
<p>It was a scathing critique of Aristotelian an paracelsian alchemy, essentially and is thought of as the beginning of modern chemistry.</p>
<p>But the year before he wrote that he wrote something that was subtitled that I just loved the title of this.</p>
<p>Touching the spring of the air.</p>
<p>That's how the back in those days talked about pressure is like you know it's like the springiness of the air touching the spring of the air.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>That is.</p>
<p>What the experience of emptiness is for me as a meditative experience it's directly touching the spring?</p>
<p>Of.</p>
<p>The void.</p>
<p>And so I just mentioned this something to know about.</p>
