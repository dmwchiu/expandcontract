You can start with focus on ordinary and just sort of deal with the ordinary sensory experience, then you can shift if you want to focus on restful states, which is a kind of thinned out an attenuated version of the focus on the ordinary.

And often after you do that. The dynamic aspect will be present. Then you can focus on flow vanishing and then.

Uh the vanishing will point you towards that which is.

Outside of time and space that which is beyond the human.

Which could be called 0 or nothingness or the source when a human being touches that nothingness?

The natural reaction to that nothingness is.

Joy Love Compassion and a call to service so from the nothingness will arise. The positive feel image talk in a very natural way, and that sort of completes the cycle.

It's sort of like a Psycho Spiritual Nautilus workout. You know the Nautilus equipment. You exercise all the main muscle groups well focus on ordinary rest.

Are the dynamic and then the intentionally creating of the positive this sort of hits. All the main psychospiritual muscle groups so to speak and it gives a nice complete workout for your soul.
