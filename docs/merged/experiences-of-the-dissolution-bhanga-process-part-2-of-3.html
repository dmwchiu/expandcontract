<p>In making that journey some People will have blissful dissolution that they just sort of dissolved back into the flow and go of the source. Some People have these horrific dissolutions that if they can stay with it, then become blissful. Eventually, just purely blissful. Some People get a sort of a mixture of both in summer not particularly aware of going through a dissolution process so it's not required.</p>
<p>You know, I do talk about these things that other teachers talk about them. Because we want to give you the heads up just in case it happens to you. Basically, you need to know two things. Why is this happening and what are we going to do about it so we do talk about it?</p>
<p>The advantage is that then if it does happen. You know why it's happening and what to do about it, but the disadvantages. If we talk about it. Some People listening will say that hasn't happened to me yet. So I must be the child of a lesser God. I'm not really making out the rest goes or not missing not always is.</p>
<p>Rough is you had People think well, you know, I have an experience that so I must not be making progress that there's that problem and then other People think Oh my God. I hope that doesn't happen to meet so there's that problem and then other People are thinking wow. I wish that would happen to me. There are problems involved in explicitly talking about these phenomenon. Scares People where it creates craving or comparison mind. But I think it's still more talking definitely get it out definitely.</p>
<p>Because uh I think if you wouldn't have been there, I would have ground for psychiatric help.</p>
<p>And that could have had tragic consequences because they may not have understood that there's actually something called the spiritual emergence network. You know about this that was created because they realized People were having spiritual experiences didn't have someone to talk too. They go into the mental health system while those mental health professionals.</p>
<p>In prior times didn't know about this stuff and the spiritual emergence network is was designed to inform mental health professionals that Hey. You know just because somebody reporting the kind of things going reporting doesn't necessarily mean they're losing their marbles and they necessarily need to be put in chemical restraint. I can see the importance about you know, there could have been horrific consequences or tragic consequences if you had gotten somebody that didn't.</p>
<p>Understand the difference between dissolution and insanity. I would say the single most important thing if a person goes through an experience like this is you gotta have somebody to talk too? Who's actually themselves been through it.</p>
<p>I made it through to the other end. That's like. That's The Cure. More than anything, it's like OK. Fine somebody who's actually experienced. This then they'll take you through it is not what I said, I would do more or less. Through it onto I never really had a little recurrence taken on a different texture that initial destabilization.</p>
<p>Up.</p>
<p>Is still going on on different?</p>
<p>In different areas in my life, but your acclimatized well every time you acclimatize to something or some fixed reference point. That seems to the carpet gets pulled out its Zen master rinse I talked about.</p>
<p>Finding that true person within you who has no fixed position will wait general that's all down toes are great words and bread. The 100 spiritual books that thought wow. I'd like to be free. I want to find that true person within reason has no fixed position. Be careful what you pray for absolutely because it's not like I have ever imagined. There is no informed consent.</p>
<p>To Enlightenment,</p>
<p>Yeah, it's both not as good as and much better than you fantasized and I realized for Year realized that for most of my life, my spiritual model was wrong.</p>
<p>In that I was a person and ego that was going to have more awareness that I was going to make a better me a new improved me with more consciousness. We're going to Polish, it break into a mirror. I was going to be a better new improved version of myself.</p>
<p>And instead I discovered that you're a break that gets into a trillion pieces and vaporized and and what I realized is that?</p>
<p>It's not that some kind of perfection gets added to me.</p>
<p>I get erased I get erased and the perfection that was always there becomes clear and starts to shine.</p>
<p>That's called a figure ground reversal and that's wisdom that speaking through you now to say those words exactly how it works.</p>
<p>I would never have guessed it from reading the books can you repeat that I interrupted you that was really good no it's just what you said.</p>
<p>You you thought it looked why I almost thought spirituality was adding something becoming bigger and bigger, more consciousness more power more clarity more focused more success in my life.</p>
<p>And then I realized that.</p>
<p>What spirituality is about is not having a self that has that at all and that those powerful qualities are just always, there in creation all the time when you step out of the way.</p>
<p>And the price for that is everything as TS Eliot said everything you ever believed in everything you ever thought you were it's a very, very humbling experience.</p>
<p>But I wouldn't give it up for for anything at this point.</p>
<p>I want to thank you.</p>
<p>For.</p>
<p>For kicking me into this place for Jump starting.</p>
<p>Excellent yeah.</p>
