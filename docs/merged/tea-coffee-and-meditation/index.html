<p>Room temperature?</p>
<p>It is certainly historically the case that the custom of drinking tea was introduced from China into Japan and Association with Zen.</p>
<p>And it was the Song Dynasty style of making tea, which is the.</p>
<p>Power T Benson was done a matcha their little Japanese pronunciation that came in with the initial introduction of Zen at that same period that I was talking about in Japan and the twelve 13th century and so forth.</p>
<p>However, China had had T prior to that and I don't know to what extent it was drunk in Japan.</p>
<p>I mean, everybody says that came in in the common area period was from China but T. It goes back at least as far as the Tang Dynasty. But in the Tang Dynasty. They made it into bricks sounds like a boot of break and I guess you pull apart like chopping right there very expensive. Then they come from actually not too far from where?</p>
<p>Phillips ancestors come from South China and it's called that that that that happens like somebody will tell you that this is like $2000, you both may break team.</p>
<p>But then later on in the main main kind state.</p>
<p>They started to steep just steep the leads that's called send shot and that was introduced into Japan also by the schools that they hold up from school and then that came in at the transition between being chased magazine early to Cabela period.</p>
<p>So there's been like 3 different ways that TI was made brick powdered and then just leaf, which is the modern way. An least at the 2 two of those ways were introduced by different.</p>
<p>Streams of ascendant came into Japan.</p>
<p>There's no problem with the stimulant if the choice is.</p>
<p>Does enlarge the alternative is well sometimes?</p>
<p>Business magazines like fast company you know, and whatever they do stories on Green Mountain Mindfulness Program. My program and the slant. They always uses isn't this word of coffee companies teaching tranquility? How strangers I think when I think of meditation.</p>
<p>Yeah, there's a tranquility, component, but there's also a clarity alertness component. You know, and then People get some People can jangly if they drink stimulants. Of course, that's not good in that case, but that doesn't seem to happen to me so.</p>
<p>I never closely researched the history, but I've heard sort of.</p>
<p>Anecdotally that coffee for filled the same role in the Islamic Sufi meditative tradition. As the Machado get for example, at after I feel better since that's really true.</p>
<p>OK, good.</p>
