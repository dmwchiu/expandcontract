You had it teacher. Once you were saying that the way to show you say this at the end of retweets you see the way to show gratitude?</p>
<p>What do you usually stay there said the best way to show gratitude to you?</p>
<p>For all you've done, I would say.</p>
<p>A couple of things.</p>
<p>One is keep up the practice.</p>
<p>The other is.</p>
<p>Pass it on as they say OK in some way or another, either at the subtle level of your vibe in your behavior changes.</p>
<p>Or at the descriptive level of you can describe your own practice to People and that's even though you're not teaching them in any explicit way they hear what you do and it. You can give a clear description of what you yourself do and that's a kind of very important way you can teach People or maybe at the fully explicit level. You pass it on by becoming a teacher.</p>
<p>Yourself and actually teaching techniques, so I would say continue your practice pass it on and then the other thing I would say.</p>
<p>What I would want from People is that they forget about me?</p>
<p>I would want them to forget about me as a person In other words, I know that sounds shocking and confusing what I mean, is.</p>
<p>To not link this to a person.</p>
<p>An individual teacher.</p>
<p>There's only one teacher 1000 armed goddess of compassion that spans all time, and all space and every individual teacher is just one hand on that face on that on her we tend to just.</p>
<p>I don't know we look at the we look at the limbs. We don't see the whole goddess.</p>
<p>So I would want them to forget about me as a person and realize that this is just one part of this giant activity.</p>
<p>That has been propagating since prehistoric times.</p>
<p>And some that link it to a particular personality what you got we just forget about me completely.</p>
<p>Well, I'm going to express my gratitude. I'm going to go out and tell somebody about this and then I'm going to forget all about it.</p>
<p>Not well.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
