As you know, I like to.

Describe the practice in terms of contrast.

Contrast in the practices born between.

Like a lot of things like maybe everything.

One of the things it's born between is.

The interplay of effort gain and dropping it from another thing it's born between.

Is working with parts and working with holes?

So.

If you



Get really good at working with parts.

That's going to impact your ability to work with the whole without making so much effort.

OK.

What you're describing in this global awareness?

Where there's a lot of mindfulness and it's?

Covering vast experience.

But you aren't having to make an effort very much to keep track of things that's the momentum.

Of that local work that you did, working with the individual parts, which was effort Ng.

OK, that coming together with the practice of do nothing which is was its own practice.

Those develop a certain momentum.

And so when you start working with the whole and you're not effort ING to penetrate the parts.

You're working with the whole but a momentum of clarity is present from having worked with the parts effort effort ingly.

And you're maintaining a minimum effort.

Uh.

Which you know how to do because you've practiced than no effort whatsoever now you get this delicious?

Thing that's in between where it's half like do nothing but it has all of the Christmas of a bear down like OK penetrate this sensation kind of practice. That's why I said good that's what you're reporting is essentially what I hope is going to happen with time.
