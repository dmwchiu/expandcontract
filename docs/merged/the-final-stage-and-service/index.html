<p>There is the final stage, if you want to use talk about stages, which is very dangerous, but the final stage is described.</p>
<p>As a sense as you go about ordinary life that you and the world are one and that together the world and the source of you in the world are one or not fundamentally separate and this is just there in ordinary life so if you consider.</p>
<p>Prayer as TS Eliot would have defined it as an experience of Oneness.</p>
<p>Difficult very good in Hebrew.</p>
<p>Then, St Pauls.</p>
<p>Up.</p>
<p>Exhortation to pray without seizing ceasing can be realized you can pray without ceasing literally every sense experience has now become a prayer.</p>
<p>In the yoga tradition that's called Saja somebody somebody on the Natch That's what sajat means natural.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>In certain Hindu traditions it's called Non Dual Awareness Advaita.</p>
<p>Meaning not tunas, OK, there's not a Tunis between the source and the world.</p>
<p>That is an actual experience, not as a philosophy as a philosophy. That's it's a waste of time.</p>
<p>As an actual sensory experience.</p>
<p>This is it's a wonderful way to live your life.</p>
<p>So Sajas Ahmadi, not not dual awareness of Vita. If I properly understand Ken Wilber. That's what he's talking about when he's talking about nondual awareness. He's talking not about a philosophy or even an experience of enlightenment, but an experience of moment by moment self in World, as you look here. Look, there, scratch your nose you know, but your shirt.</p>
<p>There's not a separation between that and the source.</p>
<p>In the Christian tradition at was sometimes called the practice of the presence of God at once that has happened.</p>
<p>You don't you can't go to church anymore, strictly speaking.</p>
<p>Logically, because you can't leave church so there's no church to go to your every year in church all the time.</p>
<p>In the Jewish tradition. It's called Briand. Yeah, IN participation in the rising things from the divine nothing in the Sufi tradition. It's called back off, which means this abiding.</p>
<p>Abiding contact.</p>
<p>In the Christian tradition if you read these.</p>
<p>The cloud of annoying it's a very amazing book very short written by an anonymous augustini and monk in the 15th century in English. He compares that experience to the air and her own. Aaron, who was who is Aaron in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Who is he was the brother of someone? Yeah, Moses Moses is brother so Moses saw God a couple times?</p>
<p>The burning Bush kind of thing, but he was up on a mountain and he wasn't really quite sure when he saw and it was just sporadic.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Aaron.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Was in charge of the the Ark of the Covenant? OK, the Tabernacle. The presence of God actually resided, according to?</p>
<p>Where belief?</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Basically he could look anytime we wanted.</p>
<p>And experience God directly anytime didn't have to be up on a mountain didn't have to be a burning. Bush didn't happen senses didn't have to be suspended or altered in anyway. It's just anytime you want to pee.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we're going to do a sweat lodge. There's a song that's often sung at the beginning of a sweat lodge.</p>
<p>Maybe maybe we'll sing it.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>But it's it's called the four directions song, but actually it's the six direction song 'cause you know, there's 6 sacred directions right.</p>
<p>N SE W up and down actually 7.</p>
<p>The 7th is those are the expect expensive directions 7th is the center.</p>
<p>Contraction it's all there, it's all there in their ceremonies. The whole paradigm of expansion and contraction. Symbolically is completely informs that Native American ceremonies.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>You know it's natural anyway. But the song says goes through each of the directions. We be out that it don't like your little cachila achito my uncle of checking checking look to the E.</p>
<p>Um your Gran father is there looking back at you, pray to him pray to him. He's right over there looking at your then go sailing EN SW Uptown, OK, no matter what direction you look the sources there.</p>
<p>In the way that I was taught the way you come to that experience is by.</p>
<p>Local E with regards to touch sight sound feel image talk and globally with regards to the whole picture at once developing a sensitivity to this in the very beginnings. Already, the end is there as soon as the time space volume of that experience is arising it's already passing.</p>
<p>And that moles that moment of sensory experience.</p>
<p>And then the expansion and contraction.</p>
<p>Flatlines.</p>
<p>And inside that flat line is in folded.</p>
<p>The entire richness of all of creation pants, Nihill Parec, Silentium, the nothing par excellence of the source.</p>
<p>Oh remember the line from TS Eliot I can I can only say there we have been didn't say there I have been you say, I can only say there we have been I cannot say where.</p>
<p>Or for how long?</p>
<p>For to do so would be to place it in Top time space, he weaves time space together.</p>
<p>So, like Einstein.</p>
<p>Einstein did it mathematically TS Eliot does it poetically so there we have been.</p>
<p>So there is 0.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Absolute time.</p>
<p>Uh and because we have been there when.</p>
<p>Past and future come apart again.</p>
<p>One looks out and.</p>
<p>Has a sense of?</p>
<p>Caring for once, larger identity brother or sister.</p>
<p>In Greek Adelphos.</p>
<p>Is from an?</p>
<p>Which means share?</p>
<p>And Delfos is whoop the one you've shared the woman.</p>
<p>If you actually experience sharing the zero womb.</p>
<p>Then from that comes a sense of wanting to serve.</p>
<p>Be of service to the larger identity.</p>
<p>So there is a link in this way between.</p>
<p>The.</p>
<p>And the themes of.</p>
<p>Going beyond the world and the themes of improving the world.</p>
<p>Is an intimate link in this way?</p>
