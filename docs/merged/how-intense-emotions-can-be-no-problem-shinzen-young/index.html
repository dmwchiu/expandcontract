<p>The ancient Dallas had experienced the same thing.</p>
<p>An and had an interesting phraseology for it.</p>
<p>It relates to gene.</p>
<p>Chi Shan, which are terms that you may be familiar with if you studied.</p>
<p>Asian Medison or martial arts and so forth so Jin means essence, literally so essence of Watt well in terms of sensory experience.</p>
<p>Often, in the process of completing an experience.</p>
<p>A certain flavor has to sort of get distilled and dominate.</p>
<p>Your awareness and that distillation of that experience.</p>
<p>Could be described in Chinese as Jing or essence now in the Dallas practice. These particular distillation that they often worked with was sexual sensation.</p>
<p>But this can be generalized to any kind of experience and it doesn't necessarily have to be in the body. Although sort of easiest to understand there, but the same thing could happen in visual an an auditory.</p>
<p>You sort of.</p>
<p>Everything gets distilled.</p>
<p>So let's say for example.</p>
<p>You are working on.</p>
<p>Having fear no longer be an issue for you.</p>
<p>How can that be?</p>
<p>'Cause there's so many circumstances.</p>
<p>Of fear in this world so many legitimate reasons to be afraid.</p>
<p>I just goes on Anon Anon? How can it be that a human being could become a human being for whom fear is no longer an issue?</p>
<p>Broader still</p>
<p>If you can do that, well why not? Add in grief and sadness.</p>
<p>Or anger.</p>
<p>Or on a more mundane note.</p>
<p>That frenetic impatients that we have all day.</p>
<p>That comes out when you're in a traffic jam.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Which is very ordinary?</p>
<p>But actually a source of significant suffering in the world.</p>
<p>And now at the other extreme.</p>
<p>What you would hardly think?</p>
<p>Any human being could ever.</p>
<p>Come to grips with shame and embarrassment how about that one.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Anger fear sadness embarrassment impatience discussed.</p>
<p>Those are the Big 6 on the negative side.</p>
<p>Of flavors of human emotion.</p>
<p>I know for sure.</p>
<p>That a human being.</p>
<p>Can reach the point where?</p>
<p>Those are no longer an issue for them.</p>
<p>So how is that possible? How is it possible to do with all of those? How is it possible to do with even one of those well.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>First, you have to be willing to allow it to distill into an essence.</p>
<p>What that means is?</p>
<p>That particular favor, whichever one. It is anger fear sadness each one has its own very distinct quality in the body.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>The essence of fear.</p>
<p>Occurs when</p>
<p>There is nothing but the fear sensation.</p>
<p>It is in every cubic centimeter of your body.</p>
<p>And it is continuous unbroken in time for a period of time now, we're very, very afraid of.</p>
<p>What the consequences of that would be?</p>
<p>But the fear of the consequences of that is actually what keeps us imprisoned for our whole life because the consequences of allowing it to become essence.</p>
<p>In the way I've just described the consequences are.</p>
<p>Nothing negative at all.</p>
<p>On the long term consequences are.</p>
<p>Freedom.</p>
<p>But because we're afraid to let it go to that point.</p>
<p>We never be very few People become free.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>If the **** really hits the fan to the point where.</p>
<p>You cannot avoid.</p>
<p>One or a combination of these negative emotions, becoming essence.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>In a sense that could be a very good thing.</p>
<p>So I repeat there is nothing but that flavor.</p>
<p>In Essentia Lee hardly aware of anything else in the body.</p>
<p>It's everywhere.</p>
<p>And it's continuous through time.</p>
<p>So now you, you are inundated with the essence of shame or.</p>
<p>Grief or fear.</p>
<p>Or.</p>
<p>The impatience associated with being in a traffic jam and you're late to an appointment.</p>
<p>That one is just about as hard to work with as all the others. It took me. Oh my God from the time I realized what the task was.</p>
<p>Which is what I'm now describing to you?</p>
<p>From the time I realized what the task was.</p>
<p>To the time where I could actually do it.</p>
<p>With that impatience thing in traffic and not suffer.</p>
<p>OK, well, I don't want to maybe I shouldn't say this OK.</p>
<p>20 years, but the 20 years past, anyway, now OK, so I know what you're saying well. I don't have 20 years, OK will get that's another Dharma talk. I'm going to give a talk about aging.</p>
<p>So, but the quick answer is.</p>
<p>Aging is a natural state of no self so you got something going for you. But if you're young and have 20 years. Well, it might not take you 20 years. But it took me 20 years to get to the point where it really felt good.</p>
<p>Like liberating.</p>
<p>To have that level of essence with?</p>
<p>Impatience.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Like I say if you're already old we've already got some things going for you and will talk about that later so there's hope in both cases.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>It becomes essence.</p>
<p>And then</p>
<p>It starts to.</p>
<p>Get sort of Liquidy.</p>
<p>Watching way che.</p>
<p>The Essence.</p>
<p>Converts into a kind of.</p>
<p>Energi.</p>
<p>That is first sort of Liquidy and then sort of shimmering and gashes.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Then.</p>
<p>Watch E Way Sean.</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>Becomes.</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p>Effortless simultaneous.</p>
<p>Formless rich doing.</p>
<p>Of space.</p>
<p>Spaciousness.</p>
<p>Effortlessly spreading effortlessly collapsing.</p>
<p>And it's at that point that you have a complete experience.</p>
<p>Of that particular essence.</p>
<p>It is now become shun.</p>
<p>Pure spirit.</p>
<p>Now, as I say they did this.</p>
<p>Traditionally, with sexual sensations.</p>
<p>So it's the same process OK.</p>
<p>The sexual sensation inundates the entire body there's nothing but that OK.</p>
<p>And it's very hard to have equanimity with that. It's hard to have equanimity with uncomfortable things is also hard to have equanimity with intense pleasures, but</p>
<p>And then it starts to flow everywhere.</p>
<p>An and then it's sort of like.</p>
<p>More gashes.</p>
<p>And then it's just pure space and that's what the Tibetans, called dead on year met the.</p>
<p>Non duality of Bliss and void.</p>
<p>So if you can do if you can go through that phase progression.</p>
<p>With just a half dozen negatives. It's a small list. Unfortunately, each one of those essences each one of those flavors.</p>
<p>Has been honed by Darwin to control animals?</p>
<p>And by Darwin I don't mean the man daughter, One I mean, natural selection over millions and millions of years, so it is very hard.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Allocate all your resources to having a complete experience of these things 'cause everything in the sensation.</p>
<p>Says.</p>
<p>I gotta do something about this. I gotta do something about this. I gotta do something about this because those sensations are have been honed by evolution 2.</p>
<p>Make animals do something quickly about something.</p>
<p>Either approach it and eat it or run away from it or etc, etc or.</p>
<p>Make Love to it, etc, etc, etc. So it's very hard to just allocate all the totality of your resources towards completing but all you have to do is do that a few times.</p>
<p>Or well, more than a few times a few 100 times.</p>
<p>And then it becomes habitual, then for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>You will have experiences in your emotional world that are maximally poignant and minimally problematic.</p>
