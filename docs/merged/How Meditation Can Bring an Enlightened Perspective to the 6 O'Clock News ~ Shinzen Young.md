Meditation can help you.

Love deeply and in fact without it, it's probably going to be very difficult to love deep.

In the sense that I'm using the term meditation can also help you act effectively but there's a lot more to acting effectively then.

Just what meditation can bring.

As many, many, many specifics.

But the one thing that meditation does help in terms of acting effectively is it helps our actions.

To be motivated and directed.

By our emotions.

As opposed to being driven and distorted.

Um.

When I lookout at the world and I see stuff that upsets me.

Uh that causes rage terror grief shame a sense of helplessness.

Which is pretty much?

The 6:00 o'clock news every night.

When I try to remember is in the end.

In the deepest analysis why is this happening?

There's surface analysis and that's important.

But.

For me as an individual in that moment. The most important thing is to not forget does it's really easy to forget not forget deeply? Why this do? Do is occuring and deeply why this? Do do is occuring this do do.

Can be the only one of it of the gazillions things that is the litany of horrors of the 6:00 o'clock news.

Deeply, it's not because human beings get together and try to create bad stuff. That doesn't happen very often.

Human beings get together and try to solve stuff.

But the solutions are typically.

Driven and distorted by suffering.

And so.

There, some optimal now sometimes that's OK because one suboptimal in this way in the other sub optimal in this way, and they sort of cancel out and we sort of muddle through.

So, sometimes, that's OK, but sometimes.

A whole bunch of People will be suboptimal in exactly the same way and then it reinforces it turns into something horrible.

Um.

So I try to remember OK.

How many millions of People for how many decades or centuries?

Experience rage grief shame terror.

And such just like I'm experiencing right now and they did not remember.

To experience it fully.



So it caused a drivenness distorted Nahs in their solution seeking.

And the effect of those bad decisions lot of times they just cancel out. It's OK. But if they don't cancel out. They all line up, then we?

Get horrible horrible things so I try to remember in that moment OK.

It may seem like less than a drop in the bucket, but I want to make sure that I'm doing my part at the deepest level.

Um too.



Improve.

The human condition at the deepest level.

That doesn't preclude taking action at other levels, but for that moment when it hits me.

I want to be able to have, I want to my metaphor, it's a little maybe?

Humorous or made some even cavalier but I think the secret is is the opposite of the James Bond Martini.

You follow the opposite of the James 119. You want to be stirred not shaken so I try to be stirred and not shaken.

And I use the focus in technique that's sincere film.

So that will that helps with acting effectively.

But it's not I'm not in for a moment, claiming that that's the totality of acting effectively. But if that component isn't there.

Then in some subtle way, and you might say well. It's so subtle it doesn't matter. But I think it matters. 'cause its qualitative may not be quantitative. But in some subtle way. I'm just part of the problem.

I'm part of what made this.

Um so.

The love deeply part.

Of doing something about the world.

Uh.

This practice is very relevant to that and the act effectively part.

It's relevant also but it's not the whole picture by any means.

Blue.
