Whole body.

Or.

God.

Now I'm going to ask you a few questions.

Would you say at this time that?

There's very much mental chatter going on or it's more quiet in your head. It's pretty quiet.

Would you say at this time that you have very much mental imagery going on or is the metal screen more in a blank state. You have images? What sort of images do you have images of your body or my body the body related images good that's a very natural reaction and once again excellent detection.

Are the sense that we have a body comes about through a combination of actual sensations. In the body and then mental pictures of the body. So, just let those mental images be there, but in the background.

As you focus on the actual sensations.

Now we're working with the secondary physical sensations of your chronic discomfort.

Chronic pain situation, I have one other question at this time are there any emotional sensations associated with this any qualities like impatience fear tearing us that kind of thing or is your emotional body fairly peaceful.

It's fairly peaceful.

K God.

If you have a lot of mental talk or emotional sensations, reactive to what was going on which can of course happens. Sometimes that would be something else. We could work with, we could work with your feel image talk reactions, but right now, it seems like that's not too much in the way so we're going to just stay with the physicality of the body.

Those secondary sensations that I'm having you focus on our do they seem more or less stable or are they more sort of flowing an like an enerji kind of thing? Are they more like solid and articulate like.

Thing would you say there?

They're pretty much.

Solid there in there, I'm aware of them at all times. It just shifts. The awareness so you're aware dishes. But the sensations themselves? Don't particularly flow or vibrate as a kind of energe take it could happen on occasion that they do, and if that does happen that something significant that you can focus on it has that ever happened in working with your body experience that it became fluid yes.

OK so you know what I'm talking about it's not happening now and it doesn't have to happen. But if it does. That's a significant experience that I call flow and you can go with that, if you wish.

OK, I'd like you to bring your attention to back to the primary area.

The two primary areas where we started.

It's possible that those areas are.

Exactly the same as they were before in terms of intensity solidity and so forth.

It's also possible that there's been a change, they might be more intense less intense more solid less solid you know more.

Sort of.

Coagulate eed or more thinned out would you say that the 2:00 secondary areas are pretty much the same as when we started or have they changed in some direction. Can you describe the nature of the change will not even aware of them at the mall and they've sort of vanished. Remember I mentioned how detecting and totally opening up to the secondary spread could sometimes dissipate the pressure from the primary.

Remember, I mentioned that well, you just experience that it's pretty cool isn't it has that ever happened to you before like this, not like this? Did you ever work? But the secondary sensations? In this systematic way obviously OK? Well then I would say you learn something pretty significant and in a relatively short period of time.

You can open your eyes if you wish and just sort of stay with the momentum of that.

That was excellent work.

Any questions about that experience.

The flow when I said solid.

It seemed to me, then when I as soon as I said at the start of flow around Oh. I see just thinking in those terms class? Can you still be aware of it as we're speaking? Yeah. Stuff like and moving all over yeah, so now it's sort of turning into an enerji experience and even the secondaires are not that uncomfortable, yeah well. You can remember what we did. Remember, the strategy. 'cause a lot of it. Remember I asked you. A lot of questions and that was in order to pick.

An optimal strategy to start with and based on what you told me seem to be OK. We'll go with the secondaires see what happens and two of the classic results. The dissipation of pressure from the primary and a sense of Fluidity occured in a relatively short period of time, so we were lucky in a sense. It doesn't always quite work that easily might take hours or even days, sometimes, but we sort of looked out.

But you can remember it you can replicate this on your own. You remember the sequence that we went through, and you remember the categories. Their definitions and the ways of working with them? Well, that's very cool. Any questions or other things, you'd like to comment on got anything more. The first ones always free will be a charge for the next one. I was terrific well very good, so there, you have actually I gotta be honest, it doesn't always work.

This easily but there you have a classic example of how what I call an interactive.

Algorithmics guidance it's interactive because I took feedback. I ask questions. Its algorithm it because I was following a flow chart in my own mind, I have.

A range of strategies that involve looping and branching and depending on the kinds of answers. I would have gotten we would have gone in very different directions. If he had a lot of thoughts and emotions about what was going on. We probably would have started with that, etc etc. So this will give you an idea of the approach to mindfulness that I call interactive algorithm ECB personalized coaching.

My contention that this way of working is the optimal way, both to teach People. The skills and also to support them when they have to apply those skills to real life challenges such as emotions or physical discomfort. So thanks rich that was great. We got it for the record your V mean excellent extraordinary very good well. We don't call it the miracle of mindfulness for nothing.

If you look back you'll see that I didn't have your change anything at all. That's what's so weird about it all, I had to do was be precise concentrated an matter effect.

We didn't try to change anything or make anything go away. And yet because of bringing that threefold skill set to this experience. Suddenly, there's a reduction of suffering and even a little bit of a pleasant kind of energy associated with it. That's the miracle of mindfulness.
