<p>Talk about one of the themes of focus on change, which is noting abrupt Deminishing's.</p>
<p>And my simple one word label for that is gone. But as with all the words that I use virtually all the words that I use.</p>
<p>We have to be careful because the meaning is not identical to the meaning and colloquial English when we say gone. It implies gone for good typically it's like gone in a date coming back, but gone is just an abrupt diminishing of something that you happen to notice has abruptly diminished so it doesn't mean that it won't come back instantly, but it's still gone.</p>
<p>Also gone does not imply every part of it is gone. You could be observing an image.</p>
<p>And let's say it's a person so there's ahead. There's arms and so forth.</p>
<p>And at some point.</p>
<p>The arm, disappears, but the rest of the images there will arm abruptly vanish is evaporates so that was a partial vanishing part, part of what you observing disappeared you notice *** you note that has gone.</p>
<p>So gone does not imply gone for good. God doesn't mean that every single part of what you were observing disappears. For example, let's say that you have a widespread sensation in your body sensation arises like burst of pain.</p>
<p>And it's got a local and it spreads out broadly. Let's say that you zoom out to cover it. You implement that option with the noting and as you're covering it like the left quadrant sort of like.</p>
<p>Abruptly, collapses, the rest of the pain is there, but a chunk of it went cut Chuck.</p>
<p>So that's an abrupt vanishing of part or an abrupt diminishing perhaps a diminishing to complete finishing.</p>
<p>So, in abrupt, diminishing of part of what you're observing that counts is it gone so part of it to disappear and it may or part of it can abruptly diminish and it may abruptly diminish all the way to no longer existing or it might just abruptly. Damen ish sort of to lower level or a smaller size.</p>
<p>So essentially flow is change that in some way is continuous. It's either WAVY or it's like pixelated so that even though each one of those little vibrations might in itself be disconnected. They sort of like tend to form something that seems fluid.</p>
<p>But abrupt diminishing's at the macroscopic scale.</p>
<p>Those are used the word God for that.</p>
<p>There is a tendency to assume that this is a very esoteric category and you know, maybe a 5 meditate for 20 years. I'll be able to detect this so disabuse yourself of that notion.</p>
<p>Every in breath comes to an end.</p>
<p>Every out breath comes to an end. That's a touch sensation and it ends and it's obvious that the flavor called in breath that sweep of sensation stops for a moment and is replaced by the flavor called out breath.</p>
<p>So don't ever say that I can't detect any vanishings.</p>
<p>That's always there.</p>
<p>Now you might say well. That's trivial, but all gonza run created equal. I don't know if you quite catch the significance of that phrase.</p>
<p>Maybe that just seems like a very enigmatic and strange way. Maybe you think I'm just wordsmithing to get your attention or to make it sound like I'm.</p>
<p>I know something that you don't or who knows what OK but all gonza run created equal.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter how?</p>
<p>Ordinary and Banalities, an airplane is passing and it's like sound sound sound sound sound gone.</p>
<p>Let's say, well, so of course doll.</p>
<p>However, as you.</p>
<p>Are.</p>
<p>Paying attention to that kind of thing you are gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Developing a sensitivity.</p>
<p>To detect the unborn source of consciousness.</p>
<p>Each one of those is a little Teeny.</p>
<p>Learning.</p>
<p>That, in and of itself.</p>
<p>Would seem completely trivial, but once you begin to some that.</p>
<p>Over many, many, many, many instances.</p>
<p>Let's be honest, probably over weeks months.</p>
<p>Years of practice.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>You start to notice that those moments of gone as I have defined it.</p>
<p>It seemed to be momentarily adverting that is to say.</p>
<p>Directing.</p>
<p>Your attention towards.</p>
<p>Something that's actually not a thing.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Therefore, it can't really be sensorially experienced but.</p>
<p>Can be contacted let's put it? It can be contacted through the senses? It just can't be experienced as a sensory experience.</p>
<p>And as you contact that more and more and more and more.</p>
<p>10, * 100, * 1000, * 10,000, * 100,000 times.</p>
<p>If you have that category.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>It starts to become clearer and clearer and clearer to you.</p>
<p>Now the clear can only be in your senses obviously.</p>
<p>So you might say that the.</p>
<p>After effect of noticing Avanish Inge.</p>
<p>Becomes more and more and more well defined in your sensory circuits.</p>
<p>And you begin to discover some rather things that are intuitively obvious and some things that are actually quite counter Intuitive.</p>
<p>What is intuitively obvious is that if you're having an unpleasant experience in your body and your mind and you're able to pay attention to the moments when parts of advantage that gives you a sense of relief.</p>
<p>What is not at all intuitively obvious is if that you're having a pleasant experience and you notice the banishing that that increases your sense of fulfillment.</p>
<p>That is actually quite counter Intuitive.</p>
<p>However, it is sensorially true, although logically it doesn't make any sense at all.</p>
<p>The Tibetans have their own enigmatic phraseology. I'm not the only person in the Buddhist world that speaks the talks weird.</p>
<p>The Oneness of Bliss and void.</p>
<p>One in the world is that well actually it refers to a whole lot of things but.</p>
<p>In the end, it's what I just talked about.</p>
<p>And what is also not intuitively obvious is?</p>
<p>If you have a neutral experience one that is neither pleasant nor unpleasant.</p>
<p>And you know it's finishing.</p>
<p>That there is great sensory fulfillment in that also it is intuitively obvious that if you notice vanishings that that might.</p>
<p>Reverberate through your senses as a restful experience.</p>
<p>That is the result of noticing the moment when a burst of talk comes to an end.</p>
<p>Might be followed by some quiet.</p>
<p>That's intuitively obvious.</p>
<p>That you can have relative rest states what I call relaxation light silence peace blank quiet.</p>
<p>So someone or a combination of those could begin to pervade your sensory experience as the result of noticing vanishings.</p>
<p>What is not intuitively obvious?</p>
<p>Is that?</p>
<p>A sense of great richness.</p>
<p>Should come?</p>
<p>From noticing vanishings it would seem like Bleakness would come from noticing vanishings.</p>
<p>But actually a sense of richness can result.</p>
<p>The way I like to conceptualize that is that?</p>
<p>The complexity of self and world is reduced to the simplicity of flow waves.</p>
<p>And but that then.</p>
<p>Contains within it all the richness of the self and world is in those waves and when the wave comes to an end.</p>
<p>In the gone.</p>
<p>The richness is still there, the re chests.</p>
<p>Is still there?</p>
<p>The assumption is.</p>
<p>When you're given this category that you are supposed to be able to detect gone. In all your sensory experiences that side sound feeling miss talk relaxation light silence peace blank white.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>If you make that assumption, then you are setting yourself up for failure.</p>
<p>That is not the assumption.</p>
<p>If you do focus on change restricted to noting vanishings, noting God.</p>
<p>The assumption is you will be able to find banishing somewhere in your sensory experience.</p>
<p>If only</p>
<p>Are.</p>
<p>In the fact that if you have a lot of chatter. You have a lot of sentence is if you have a lot of sentence is you have a lot of periods each one of those endings.</p>
<p>Is a God talk talk on talk on?</p>
<p>Or.</p>
<p>You're still alive, so you're going to take another in breath and it's going to come to an end. You're going to take another out breath and it's going to come to an end.</p>
<p>So the assumption is that you can find gone if you have a lot of chatter and if you're still breathing.</p>
<p>And the assumption is that that's all you ever have to focus on in order to do the technique absolutely perfect all gonza run created equal.</p>
<p>Sorry owes teacher.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Gives People koans of course, it's Rinzai Zen, but he says. I'm hope I'm not misquoting but I think sorry. You said this the very best students don't need koans.</p>
<p>They do their entire enlightenment process with the breath.</p>
<p>Noticing.</p>
<p>That what happens at the moment when the in and the out breath ends.</p>
<p>What happens at that instant is all there ever is ever?</p>
<p>So that's complete enlightenment, you're living inside 0.</p>
<p>So that's a few things to say about this theme.</p>
<p>Ending in Sanskrit is Nero to an IRODHA.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>That's also a synonym for Nirvana.</p>
<p>And Nirvana means to blow out literally but it also means to quench.</p>
<p>Fire of suffering.</p>
<p>But it also means to quench your thirst in the sense of being completely in Totale fulfilled hence the recess.</p>
<p>In the void.</p>
