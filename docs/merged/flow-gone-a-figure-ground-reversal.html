<p>At first you'll probably be aware of where the flow is what's flowing and so forth, but</p>
<p>You may reach a point where you actually.</p>
<p>Don't care and don't even know whether it's somatic visual or auditory. Those descriptors discriminations breakdown. Subjective versus object. If breaks down ordinary versus restful breaks down all you're interested in is just flow.</p>
<p>And you actually begin to lose specificity with regards to all the distinctions that we make in the other techniques. That's highly desirable. You can't make that happen. But there's really you know how I always say it's a dialectical process. So half of the dialectic is making these discriminations in a healthy way. The other half is destroying the discriminations also in a healthy way.</p>
<p>Flow is</p>
<p>Locom Platis, ill it's the great leveler.</p>
<p>That destroys distinctions, the only greater level or is gone.</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>Destroys time and space can't have distinctions without time in space. You could still distinguish flavors of flow. Libratory Angela Tori. There's no different flavors of God.</p>
<p>If you reach a point where you're noting flow and.</p>
<p>It's like sort of what was describing OK. It's like all flow and you don't even know what it is or where it is or who you are where you are.</p>
<p>That now you're getting close to that figure ground reversal that I talked about last night.</p>
<p>Good go with that same deal with the gone.</p>
<p>You can reach a point where you don't know what it is. It's disappearing. You don't even know whether it was big or small pleasant unpleasant simple complex.</p>
<p>You forget about all that you just dominated by the vanish ringness.</p>
<p>Of things.</p>
<p>And that once again leads to the figure ground reversal peace.</p>
<p>That was what you were starting to experience.</p>
<p>And if you get the combined where its flow go flow. Goaf logo that's all your width then that's.</p>
<p>That's</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Going to lead to that experience of.</p>
<p>There's this.</p>
<p>Matrix of nothingness that is birthing.</p>
<p>Self and seen moment by moment.</p>
<p>Inside that rhythm of flow and gold flow and go when there's go.</p>
<p>There's nothing.</p>
<p>And then it breaks apart and it sort of.</p>
<p>Scintillates and that scintillating missed if it gets coagulative. We call it a self in the world.</p>
<p>If it doesn't get coagulate eed we call it pure spirit and it's.</p>
<p>Part of it is constantly spreading out effortlessly part of his constantly pulling an effortlessly it's a fountain of youth.</p>
<p>Invisible.</p>
<p>Doing so that would be the flow gone flow going to combine the 2:00 together. That's an option for focus on check.</p>
