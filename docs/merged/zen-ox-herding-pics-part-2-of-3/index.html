<p>You.</p>
<p>Internalize the Enlightenment to the point where?</p>
<p>It.</p>
<p>Can't slip away from you and doesn't run wild.</p>
<p>OK, it follows you.</p>
<p>And as wonderful as that is.</p>
<p>That cannot be compared to.</p>
<p>Getting on the ox.</p>
<p>Actually, writing it.</p>
<p>This is awesome.</p>
<p>People are really afraid of this.</p>
<p>It's one thing to.</p>
<p>CD aux even to catch it even to sort of get it to.</p>
<p>Be manageable this is the ox of consciousness OK.</p>
<p>The some now some gal.</p>
<p>When it comes to writing on the Hawks that's scary.</p>
<p>Some of you are facing this, this stage.</p>
<p>If you look carefully.</p>
<p>You'll see.</p>
<p>The Arts is going this way.</p>
<p>You see the boy.</p>
<p>He's playing a flute.</p>
<p>Quite relaxed.</p>
<p>But he's looking the other way.</p>
<p>Is writing the ox backwards?</p>
<p>Do you understand?</p>
<p>There's no informed consent to enlightenment.</p>
<p>Enlightenment is better than you think it is, and not nearly what is cracked up to be?</p>
<p>Which one of those did you want to hear?</p>
<p>Both or one both or neither.</p>
<p>Enlightenment is like is like continually falling off a Cliff and being completely comfortable with that.</p>
<p>A great and powerful.</p>
<p>Beast carries you.</p>
<p>And you have to give up.</p>
<p>Your investment.</p>
<p>With where it's going.</p>
<p>It's the Ultimate Act of surrender writing the ox backwards.</p>
<p>The flow of impermanence.</p>
<p>You fall.</p>
<p>It's like falling down but you don't fall down you fall up into existence moment by moment, which is what pro teach us. Some would Potter means it's a falling but a falling up.</p>
<p>Without any fixation without needing to know.</p>
<p>What's going to happen next you simply fall into?</p>
<p>What needs to be done moment by moment?</p>
<p>So this might be called the act of true faith.</p>
<p>As opposed to belief.</p>
<p>Which is holding on to something?</p>
<p>Faith.</p>
<p>Is?</p>
<p>Letting go of the need to be oriented. The need to have answers. This is surrendering to the flow of expansion and contraction.</p>
<p>Writing writing on the wave.</p>
<p>Of.</p>
<p>The dynamic wave of nothing whatsoever, Nahs.</p>
<p>And letting it carry you.</p>
<p>So that's quite a profound active.</p>
<p>Faith what comes next.</p>
<p>The ox.</p>
<p>Has now carried you home he's home?</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>And he's completely.</p>
<p>At rest.</p>
<p>He's found final repose of the spirit.</p>
<p>In his home.</p>
<p>And the ox.</p>
<p>Is gone?</p>
<p>Only who he really was remains.</p>
<p>Just the person.</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>True authentic human with no fixated position whatsoever.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>No more need.</p>
<p>For a mind as an object.</p>
<p>He's home.</p>
<p>He rode the ox home.</p>
<p>Complete enlightenment.</p>
<p>Nirvana.</p>
<p>But there's 3 more pictures.</p>
<p>What could they possibly stand for?</p>
<p>Well, if you read the books.</p>
<p>They give you various.</p>
<p>Explanations.</p>
<p>But uhm.</p>
<p>I was privileged to.</p>
<p>Discuss these pictures with a Japanese Zen Master, many years ago.</p>
<p>Who told me that there is an oral tradition?</p>
<p>About these 10 pictures.</p>
<p>That has not been written down.</p>
<p>That really it ends here.</p>
<p>This is complete enlightenment this is final repose.</p>
<p>Pictures 89 and 10 represent.</p>
<p>The substance.</p>
<p>Form.</p>
<p>And purpose of enlightenment.</p>
<p>Substance in Chinese is called T.</p>
<p>Which literally means?</p>
<p>Body.</p>
<p>Are the form?</p>
<p>Let's call Sean which is just that the form or the appearance and then what it's good for what it's used for is young and that's the application or they use.</p>
<p>So T Sean Young, according to this row, she's oral tradition.</p>
<p>The last three of these oxherding pictures.</p>
<p>Uh tell us.</p>
<p>The substance.</p>
<p>The appearance.</p>
<p>And the ultimate use of enlightenment.</p>
<p>So you can hardly wait right.</p>
<p>Substances coming up first.</p>
<p>What is made out of the matter?</p>
<p>The matter itself.</p>
<p>And here is the substance of enlightenment.</p>
<p>No substance whatsoever.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>When the emperor *** Bodhi Dharma.</p>
<p>What is the first principle of holiness?</p>
<p>What did Bodhi Dharma say wide open an nothing holy?</p>
<p>What's the form of enlightenment?</p>
<p>The mountains and the Cherry Blossoms.</p>
<p>The ordinary appearances of the world every single thing.</p>
<p>Is the appearance of enlightenment?</p>
