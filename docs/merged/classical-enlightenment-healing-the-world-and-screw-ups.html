<p>If we take if by that we mean stream entry.</p>
<p>And we mean millions and millions of People having that experience.</p>
<p>I don't have a scintilla doubt.</p>
<p>Well, you have to look at the big picture OK.</p>
<p>You have to look at.</p>
<p>All the People that were ever enlightened.</p>
<p>As they are have been in the world.</p>
<p>And then you have to compare that to as they would have been if they haven't been in light and you have to take all the P.</p>
<p>Because most enlightened People are not public figures.</p>
<p>And there may be indeed a certain push.</p>
<p>To the ones that do become public figures that also is related to.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I didn't say it would heal the world right away either.</p>
<p>I just because remember I use classical enlightenment is a rough.</p>
<p>Rough equivalent to stream entry.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>That's the first out of 4 steps.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>And usually about 20 years after stream entry you realize how unenlightened you really are.</p>
<p>And that the work is now just starting.</p>
<p>But you're guaranteed success essentially so.</p>
<p>You know after a few 100 years of millions and millions of stream enterers. I think that the course of this planet would pretty much be take care of itself.</p>
<p>Now of course.</p>
<p>I mean, if you want to.</p>
<p>Think really ambitious maybe.</p>
<p>If we had a really deep model of enlightenment, we'd be able to figure out how to churn out our hearts.</p>
<p>With consistency.</p>
<p>That's only maybe 5 times as ambitious is turning out stream enterers? Who knows now. If you turn out if you start having millions and millions of our hearts on the planet.</p>
<p>You know it's very quick, but if you.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Yeah, plenty of People that have seen the no self screw up but.</p>
<p>Then there.</p>
<p>You have to look up on it from the big picture.</p>
<p>How badly would they have screwed up if they hadn't done that.</p>
<p>Well, I can think of maybe that I know personally.</p>
<p>Of.</p>
<p>Maybe a dozen People that have seen the no self were authentically enlightened at least to the stream entry level and had major public screwups. Let's maybe a dozen OK.</p>
<p>But there's probably.</p>
<p>100 times that many enlightened People on the planet so that's 1%.</p>
<p>That we know about.</p>
<p>And even those groups are.</p>
<p>You know, I mean?</p>
<p>I can.</p>
<p>I can only think of a couple that I would say are like really horrible.</p>
<p>Relative to the normal human screwups right.</p>
<p>I mean when the teachers screw up if you notice by and large is just normal. Humans grew up so I mean that People have sexual harrassment bosses sort of like things People do right.</p>
<p>I can only offhand.</p>
<p>Right now.</p>
<p>Maybe think of one or 2 that I would say where like really bad you know.</p>
