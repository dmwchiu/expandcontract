My name is Stephanie Nash and I am sitting here interviewing Shinzen Young, who is an innovative meditation teacher who's come up with his own.

Mathematical and Scientifiques.

Journey to 0 and we're going to be talking about a lot of things today. But before we do I want to make sure everyone knows how to get more of you? How to access video talks appears on the website. You have MP threes. You do retreats in person and you also do Phone based retweets.

So let's just go through these and make sure we know which is which first for your personal retreats where if someone wants to come and do a residential retreat with you they would go to shinzen.org that's correct that's also a site with.

More than books worth of free article content so that's sort of my personal side and Archives. Previous work that I've done so you go to sinsen.org and look under my schedule if you want to come to A.

On site program with me or if you want to get like tons of articles and you can also order CDs. Yes, you have a whole CD. the CD store. There are there, but more modernly. I have an MP3 site and I think most People are more modern now where People would probably go there, although some People like the CDs. The MP three site is shinzentalks.com so you can download.

Is quite a bit there. They really convenient and really cool site? Is basic mindfulness.org that's one stop shopping for practice, cool site? What's cool about it is all of the things that tend to get in the way of People doing this practice, which means it's hard to get instruction from.

Somebody that you can relate to because they may not move in your area. You can't travel. You can't leave your family. You don't want to incur expenses. You don't want it to take a lot of time. There's a lot of speed bumps that get in the way of having a regular practice. Basic mindfulness.org is my attempt to get rid of those speed bumps for the world. It's one shop, stopping for.

Practice meaning that we run classes and very, very short micro retreats that are telephone based now when I try to describe this to people. I always get this glazed over sort of quizzical look because they can't quite compute wait. It's in my home. It's a telephone? How does this all work kind of thing all I can say is?

Just try it, you will see it's very intuitive you get cheap long distance, calling and if you don't know how to do that. We've got something on the site that tells you how to get it, dirt cheap. You get hands free operation, either with a headset or just a speaker Phone. You're not on the telephone all the time.

But you are on for interaction with me and for group discussion an for group guided then you hang up. You work on your own and then you come back and you have more discussion. So all the features that would be present in a residential retreat that might extend for a week. We've economically packed into a 4 hour micro retreat situation and one thing I can say from having done this actually.

Uh when we're on the Phone. Sometimes there's a greater intimacy, sometimes on a Phone. When we talked to People versus in person where you're dealing with that Enerji and having your voice coming in on the Phone also when I'm in my home it brings that.

It brings the Association of the work into my home but it also feels quite personalized as opposed to being in a room with a lot of People. It's kind of like it does many paradoxes People thought it's going to destroy the sense of Group Enerji. Well, it doesn't destroy it. It creates a different group enerji, but there's still a group Enerji and I can't explain it, but there is so you got that.

People said Oh well, it's in my home and in my home is where all my buttons are that I'm going to be distracted and self indulgent. I gotta go away to a center well what we discovered is counterintuitively if you do it, you can do it in your home and when you do it. Sacramental eyes is the home rather than polluting the retreat doing it in your home sacramental eyes is your home and then you see that you can do it in your home so there were many counter.

Very nice counter intuitive results from this so basically the second weekend of every month, is home retreat practice weekend. We give 5 independent programs. At least 1 of which every month, is an intro program requiring no previous experience in anything like this whatsoever, meaning edit any given month anybody anywhere in the world.

Can get started with the practice would be off and running with a technique and then next month they can come back.

Maybe do that same technique or learn another technique and it's all there, but you just have to go to basicmindfulness.org read how to get started.

Is it written material? Does written material that has like shin said.org? Is vast archival stuff but the the audios and the readings that basic mindfulness.org is pared down that's just what you need in order to get started with the practice.
