<p>Of.</p>
<p>Manifesting.</p>
<p>Was described by some of the Neo Platonists as?</p>
<p>The from the good to the good never leaving the good.</p>
<p>And there's a metaphor of a fountain that gush is out.</p>
<p>Gathers back at the same time.</p>
<p>If you look at your central nervous system.</p>
<p>The functional anatomy, there's something right in the center of your brain called the Corona Radiata.</p>
<p>It.</p>
<p>And it looks like a fountain.</p>
<p>And this sensory fibers go up and the motor fibers come down roughly speaking.</p>
<p>I suspect that this is not a coincidence, so from the good back to the good never leaving the good.</p>
<p>You expand and contract simultaneously, but the entire thing is surrounded by zero.</p>
<p>So, although there is contrast, there is no birth.</p>
<p>Ironically, by utterly giving yourself to life and death.</p>
<p>You abide in transcendence of life and death.</p>
<p>You are literally born into the unborn.</p>
<p>And just like someone who's born into life.</p>
<p>Doesn't know the rules doesn't know the lay of the land. It takes many years for the no self the unborn to learn how to carry on all of the functions of the self self.</p>
<p>There's some pictures called the Zen Oxherding Pictures that portray that on the metaphor of training and ox.</p>
<p>Time in space arise by the arising of what inhabits time in space, which is our subjective world of field image talk and our so called object if world of touch sight sound.</p>
<p>Now, Bye.</p>
<p>Utterly, giving yourself.</p>
<p>To whatever wants to say, yes and whatever wants to say no.</p>
<p>2 utterly giving yourself to whatever pushes out and whatever pulls in.</p>
<p>However, uncomfortable that may be for awhile.</p>
<p>We get a little bit of the cosmic.</p>
<p>Act affirmation and a little bit of the cosmic negation.</p>
<p>Just a tiny little fraction of it. This is the way Sasaki Roshi teachers.</p>
<p>So we give that tiny fraction back, too.</p>
<p>The rest of the universe. The totality of expansion in the totality of contraction and then our tiny little bit.</p>
<p>Merges with the totality.</p>
<p>And there's no something nahs.</p>
<p>To prevent</p>
<p>Expansion and contraction from Reemerging.</p>
<p>Coming back together into the one zero.</p>
<p>And to experience this cycle over and over again as you look to the right look to the left talked to this person think about this do that plan dinner eat dinner?</p>
<p>Make Love,</p>
<p>Make arguments too.</p>
<p>Not lose track that this is happening would be tantamount to what might be called Living Nirvana. I spoke about how flow can integrate.</p>
<p>The mind and the body.</p>
<p>I spoke about how flow can integrate.</p>
<p>Inside and outside.</p>
<p>But mind and body inside and outside.</p>
<p>Can be integrated?</p>
<p>In the sense of.</p>
<p>Never disconnected from.</p>
<p>The source the zero the balance point, the one nothing the.</p>
<p>Fulfilling.</p>
<p>Vacuity.</p>
<p>It's this word Nirvana. We can't translate it into English, it means both cessation.</p>
<p>And complete fulfillment.</p>
<p>Because it's quenching.</p>
<p>The fire is quenched the fire of suffering is quenched, but your thirst is quenched meaning.</p>
<p>That you have.</p>
<p>Fulfillment.</p>
<p>And not just a little bit of fulfillment.</p>
<p>But a kind of.</p>
<p>Otter fulfillment for no reason whatsoever.</p>
<p>Happiness independent of conditions Suki Hoto May, you be happy is the traditional greeting in Tera Vaada Buddhism. In the Pali language happy in the sense of good things happen to you.</p>
<p>And happy in the sense that your happiness is not dependent on good things happening to you.</p>
<p>Both of these connotations are present when.</p>
<p>People say Suki Hoto.</p>
<p>Ironically, bye bye.</p>
<p>Being able to innocence abstract innocence see that.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>All change.</p>
<p>In this can be in some way looked upon as an interplay of oppositely directed doings.</p>
<p>And then by seeing that they all boil down to young and Jen.</p>
<p>Yes, and no life and death.</p>
<p>Expansion and contraction.</p>
<p>Moving forward moving backward, etc etc. You surrender the life and death.</p>
<p>And you're torn apart.</p>
<p>But don't worry.</p>
<p>All that happens is you become life and death. This is I didn't make this phraseology out. This is verbatim, Sasaki Roche E Asia.</p>
<p>He says I know it's scary to think of completely surrendering.</p>
<p>2 expansion and contraction. It's scary to think, to consider allowing yourself to literally be torn apart.</p>
<p>By the forces of nature.</p>
<p>But don't be scared.</p>
<p>All that's going to happen is when you surrender to life and death you will become.</p>
<p>Life and death, they will no longer be an object for you and therefore you will become free from life and death. You will become that which is beyond life and death because life and death will will re balance will reunite.</p>
<p>Into the still point of the turning world. Neither life nor death. Neither movement from North towards this could also be described as absolute present.</p>
<p>Future and past uniting.</p>
<p>In an absolute presence that has no.</p>
<p>Duration whatsoever.</p>
<p>Spatially paper thin, temporal temp temporally.</p>
<p>Instantaneous.</p>
