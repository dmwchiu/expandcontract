This paradigm that I give you where we can divide the mind into the image piece in the talk peace and then then that interacts with the body that touch feel whatever.

I didn't come up with this OK this idea.

But the person who did come up with it is in this room. So I'm going to make his feel image docspace activate? Where is Peter?



If first timer so you may not know who this man is this is Peter Marks.

The inventor of body image talk and Essentia Lee, the person responsible for.

This approach to meditation that I teach being available consistently in Canada.

The fact that I kind of stumbled onto one day, saying, I notice that there's these pictures and easy I mean?

Then he he kind of is far too generous in what I've contributed. This thing I mean? Believe me it's like.

It's like kind of.

I came to know with three boards, but he did the Ark himself.

Well, here's what happened.

He was give me a guided OK. This part I. I know because I Journal this part, he was giving me a guided.

And I was just telling him what I was experiencing.

And he said. What did you say that's how I didn't come to and say coach I've got a really great idea?

If he hadn't picked it up, I might even own. I said it. I mean that's that's the honest truth. I 'cause I thought that's what everybody saw but there is.

What what did I say Oh I was just I was out loud? I said Oh I see well he was he was having to look at what we now call active active states right of image and talk or I've just thinking, we just.

Just thinking, I mean, if you read a lot of the stuff. It's just thinking they don't talk about breaking it down the way he has right so I just I just basically he said. Why are you experiencing and so I just I just said to AC talk we don't have any arrests will stuff at that time well member. Show me wouldn't have wrestled rest is within 5 six years isn't it. I would say 4 years is that right, yeah, so yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and so and so I was just saying.

Thinking and talk and talk and and then.

Said picture picture and that's what I called I called a picture and.

He said what you say, said picture when you see it's hard to believe with his mind that he had an experience that but?

I suspect that he had experience it, but he's just goes so deep that he dismisses some of that.

Surface surface stuff, I mean, I have no idea but for each of you, you likely know the first time you did. This you had a predominant way this would I think my students. There is a predominant. Imager talk that they come up with right and then once you introduce some give it a heads up. Then they'll say, Oh yeah. I am and now that you're doing, it, you know that every minute you're having 10 hits of image 10 hits of thought and also the rest states all at once right the more you start to really look at this stuff you see it's all over the place all the time right, I mean, it's just layered scaffold upon scaffolding.

That's why it's it's it's just so fascinating to see the way he is. I mean, this divide and conquer piece. You know is this the other thing about these unique ways of just summarizing it.



Yeah, we've we've come up with a lot of things I was, I was either blessed or cursed to have some of the early days of him kind of feeling his way. On some of these things you know, some of the sweat work. We did and that it just things just kind of evolved. I think but more important to your second point I mean, it's just it's just so great to see what I mean. He literally has rounded this thing out to 99 + 9% of what it is, you know, I mean, just just really as I say in the acknowledgement of this book, Slash Manual that I've written.

Just such a great acknowledgement that he is just relieving suffering on this planet with this stuff just in such incredible ways.

There's something else that I've had a really restrain myself today because in my own lingo in my own time, all the time I teach to bit excuse me be fit body. Sensations feeling image and talk so that's be fit and that's that's about 10 years ago. That's what we were. We were by sensations. Feeling image and talk and there's several of us oldies that still have not really bought into the idea of yeah, yeah.

I know where to go with this because it's you know it's public and all that, but Hey, the big guys heard me tell him a dozen times and we have some very, very animated discussions over basically say you know, I think you're being dead right on this functions in I think you're absolutely right and separating kind of touch and feel and I'm sure that it's the field is maybe all in the body. I mean, so therefore, you can legitimately fit spaces body image. However, I think for the average person learning it.

They relate to a body sensation like pain in my knee and they relate to pain in my heart different so that's why I continue to teach just be fit. So I just say this because stay open this and if he was. He would say the same thing? Don't just buy what I tell you like make it your own, he's always saying make it your own so some of this is just not chosen to kind of come on board with some of the current stuff, but for the most part.





Yeah.
