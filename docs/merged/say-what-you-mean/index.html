<p>Is trained themselves to quote say what you mean?</p>
<p>You know where I got this phrase from.</p>
<p>Say what you mean</p>
<p>It's from literature actually sort of Classic in English literature.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>It's by a book it's</p>
<p>Now the author of the book is named Charles Dotson.</p>
<p>Doesn't ring a Bell? Well that was real name is noda plume was?</p>
<p>Huh Lewis Carroll very good.</p>
<p>Um so Lewis Carroll is known as the writer of children's books and Charles dots dots and is known as the Victorian period mathematician.</p>
<p>There's even a theorem named after him not theorem, but a mathematical process and in fact. Oh, I'm going to know I'm going to get on a geek out so I gotta bring myself in this is the problem OK just sort of whatever comes up.</p>
<p>****** out.</p>
<p>So the Mad Hatters Tea Party.</p>
<p>It had it contains a pun.</p>
<p>That almost no one realises.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>A mathematical pun.</p>
<p>T was also was a letter that was used as a variable OK.</p>
<p>In his day by People who were.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Insisting on the use of imaginary numbers and complex variables and things like that, and Dotson was actually a very old fashion kind of mathematician. It was more in the old-fashioned Euclidean mathematics and he actually didn't like the new map. The new math of the Victorian period, which probably seems like very old math, but the actually he was.</p>
<p>Wrong complex variables turned out to be that, like this hugely hugely useful thing, which I'll give a whole. Dharma talk on one of these days. But in any event, yeah, so the T is mathematical pie on the Tea Party anyway at the Mad Hatters Tea Party.</p>
<p>There is a dialogue with Alice and the Marsh hair and the dormouse and the Mad Hatter.</p>
<p>In which case in which each of those People tell Alice in in no uncertain terms to mean? What you say is completely different from saying what you mean the mad. Hatter says, said something like you need to say what you mean Alice says well I always mean? what I say, and then they get on this big riff. About a these aren't the same at all at all at all to say what you mean.</p>
<p>Means that you have an idea and when it comes out in words it's accurate.</p>
<p>And it turns out that that's not such an easy thing to do.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of training.</p>
<p>A lot of care are.</p>
<p>We're not stupid we know what we're saying and in our mind.</p>
<p>It's evidence based on logical but if you really listen to yourself, saying OK. Sometimes you're not really saying what you mean? What's in your mind is not what the words actually are so I've spent a long, long time trying to train myself to be careful about that and I'm a little bit.</p>
<p>How should I say?</p>
<p>Finicky prissy fussy about you folks learning how to do the same thing. 'cause I think it's extremely useful. But it's also really hard and the reason that I know it's hard is even though.</p>
<p>I work at it and I'm pretty good at it. I'm amazed how many times. I myself and not really quite accurately, saying what I mean?</p>
<p>Which is?</p>
<p>It happens, it's OK every once in awhile.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I look back and I realize to my horror that I said.</p>
<p>The opposite of what I meant.</p>
<p>And that's like bad.</p>
<p>Which I did last night?</p>
<p>I don't know if you know what I'm talking about. Maybe you can. Guess what I was trying to convey is that this path.</p>
<p>Is available to the entire spectrum of?</p>
<p>Culture and philosophy and politics.</p>
<p>And that conservative People, which I referred to as quote Republicans and so forth should be as comfortable with. In this setting as any other People, an glory at the notion that that is the case can be the case. But it came out sounding like I was sort of making fun of conservative and Republican. People then that is actually the way it came out, which was exactly the opposite of what I had in my head.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Bad bad bad with someone pointed out to me a nice OK, when you're right. You're right so anyway. That's I think a really important point. The types of People that in our culture would be called.</p>
<p>Are Conservatives?</p>
<p>Were the types of People that in the context of Asia? Where my teachers?</p>
<p>And they saved my soul.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>So anyway.</p>
<p>Just wanted to mention that.</p>
