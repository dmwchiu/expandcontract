What should we do?

To make this world a better place.

People often ask me what you know, there's this circumstance with that condition.

In the world.

Um.

So.

I find myself, saying.

As it I can't help people with the specifics. I don't know the specifics of politics or how things should work in the world. But I do know some general principles that I think hold it in all cases.

And the way I sum it up is the phrase that I used at the end of the last stop, which is love deeply and act effectively now acting effectively.



Is uh is related to your mindfulness skills?

And strategies, but

That's not the whole picture of acting effectively acting effectively involves a lot of things, but mindfulness skills and strategies do enter rim.

All.

Loving deeply.

Uh.

Critically depends on mindfulness skills and techniques so.









We.

Always are asking.

What is love?

Um.

And we're always sort of seeking something.

Um.

Is?

Taken me decades to have a confident answer out with regards to the question. What is love at a very deep weapon?

I don't think I can confidently answer it at more superficial levels that would be other kinds of experts would talk about that. But I do have a confident answer as to what it is.

Out a very deep level, maybe the deepest level.

So.



We channel is Montrae.

O'Malley puppy who Halo to the jewel in the Lotus.

So if you think of.

Love is this.

Fragrant colorful.

Attractive flower.

Is there in the center of it something?

That is its essence that could be called the jewel that's hidden inside that Lotus.

And I would say yes.

And I would say that I can put it into words.

I.

I'm also tempted not to put it into words because the words are likely to be a let out until there is an experience that.

That goes with those words.

So the the description is.

Sort of.

Come.

Not all that poetic.

Um.



How do we know that there's a world?

Well, we see it.

We hear it, we touch it.

And we think about it.

Of course when we think about it, we

See it here comments about it bad words about it, we have emotional.

Sensation so.

Through inner and outer activity, we have the perception that there is a world.

And through those same sense gates, we have the perception that we have a self.

So.

As you are mindfulness skills develop?

It becomes possible to have a more and more complete experience of inner and outer see, hear feel.

That means an experience with.

Progressively greater sensory richness, but also progressively less moment by moment fixation.

That leads to at paradoxical experience.

Which is?

Une experience of maximal richness.

Because it's getting richer and richer and richer.

But at the same time, minimal something nahs.

Because the amount of time that you're fixating any particular part of it is getting shorter and shorter and shorter.

So at the limit.

Of.

Add clarity and equanimity.

Um.

Is the experience that is optimally?

Rich.

And also utterly vacuous at the same time.

And can you put into words what that's like?

Short, but as I say it's likely to be a bit of a let down.

What it's like is?

That there is an absolute rest.

Where in

Time, and space collapse to a dimensionless point.

That has no position.

And then that.

Breaks apart.

And the positive spreads and the negative pull Zune.

There's a simultaneous expansion and contraction like a space fountain.

Then spreading and collapsing it's the fountain of youth.

Constantly, own it's gushing and gathering.

An it's

Shimmering.

Vibrant space.

And if you stay with that.



Uh.

You have everything you ever wanted.

And you have absolute safety you're being held by your cosmic parents.

Your physical parents would have been.

Hey.

A representation.

Of this cosmic parenting.

Ah.



But most People don't notice that even though it happens, thousands of times a day.

Each Sunday.

See the world.

Order themselves or

Here, or touch or think.

Or move or speak.

Just before.

This happens.

So People don't notice it number one and #2 it get that.

Scintillating missed.

Coagulates into inner and outer see her feel.

And there's a sense of.

And I met his vulnerable and.

Frost and

Um.

Disconsolate.

Not getting what it wants.

And there is a sense of and it.

That is fundamentally alien and.

Threatening.

Call the world or the other.

Um.

So.



The jewel in the Lotus.

Um.

When you unfold the pedals and look at what's on the inside.

When we say we're experiencing.

Human love,

Beard of the physical kind or any other kind.

But it's the human love well the human love is that is that flower.

And certainly that has its place.

In the nature of things, but it's also important to.





Have a deeper context where by you.

Understand this nonhuman love.

That is hidden within.

Always want.

Anne is available all the time.

So.

Um.







To love deeply means.

That.

Before.

That you are aware.



That love always comes 1st.

You can't.

Have any reaction.

Of any sort whatsoever.

Without first having a perception.

Over yourself in the world except.

At the origin of each perception of self and world.

Is this this?

Deep love,

So if you come in contact with this.

That means that all of the decisions that judgments are the reactions, there still going to happen like they always do.

But there is an inescapable context.

That proceeds so that then colors.

Your response is. It doesn't mean that you no longer judge.

Or that you can't take action or that you can't.

Um confront

Or oppose.

It doesn't militate against any of that.

But it just puts it in a different context.

So.

Let's say that there's something going on in the world that you think is bad.

And action needs to be taken to change this.

Certainly legitimate.

Um.



If you're able to love deeply.

That's going to have a huge effect on acting effectively.

Um.

Unfortunately, the bad news is.

Most humans have not yet learned how to love deeply.

So.

Because loving deeply means hundreds of times in the day. Whenever you perceive the other the enemy. The source of the problem.

Then.

It.

Whenever you perceive that.

You first perceive.

That being loved into existence by the source.

Whether you perceive it by sight sound touch or whether you perceive it by thinking about it.

I mentioned the protein autonomy to literature.

Magistri there's the wisdom function and then there's the wisdom writings.

So, in the temples.

At least in the temple where I lived in Japan at Koyasan, there was a custom.



They celebrate New Years, a little differently than here, So what you do is you stay up all night like here on New Year's Eve. But you read the the entire 20,000 verses of approaching a paramita or at least as much of it as you can get through.

Oh.

Uh you chanted in sino Japanese.

So I think I mentioned that it's.

It's like an Encyclopedia Britannica. It's just got all this detail of information about the world.

India, 2000 years ago, approximately translated into Chinese so it just.

List all this stuff and then it says this is outdated that's empty it's got all the.

You know all the cultural information.

Crazy ideas, they had about geography and you know, etc, etc. And then it says this is empty. This is empty this is empty.

And you might wonder well what's the point.

But.

When we won, I won New Years when we were doing that, we were chanting all night.

And you have to look at the book right 'cause there. We can memorize so much so you actually reading it so you're seeing what the text says.

Uh.

And I realize that.

What what this was all about?

Why we were doing that?

'Cause well, let's see do you know the?

Did you ever hear Allen Ginsberg's parody of the project a pyramid on?

Oh.

I don't know if it was written down or if you just performed it.

But it was something to the effect of.

**** is empty ****** empty. Markesan can screw is empty something along those lines, yeah, really probably find it on the Internet so.

Well, I just said a bunch of 4 letter words, but it when you.

If I say you know houses are empty apartments are empty parks are empty.

If you really watching image space.

You will see that you get what incense for this call spoke to spo.

TSSPHOTS program spoke up what a sapota is is a little flicker of an image.

That's very, very fleeting.

So when you're reading you know this is empty. This is empty everyone of those those, this is.

I started to notice created am a momentary mental image how else would I know what it means right.

And then I started to.

Tune into that and I could see the images each one of those images born in between expansion and contraction.

Coming from and returning to.

Empty.

So it's a whole meditation.

You're thinking about the world? How do you think about the world do you actually are actually aware?

But each one of those bursts of image and talk come from and return to the source.

So once you sort of realize that.

Oh.

You will be able to understand the.

The early 20th 21st century North American Sutra.

Which goes like this?

Trump is empty. Obama is empty trunk is empty. Obama, as empty as many times as you need to hear that.
