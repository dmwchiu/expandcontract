<p>If a teacher is really qualified.</p>
<p>How can I know if the teacher has had a liberation experience?</p>
<p>Well, actually merely having a liberation experience doesn't necessarily make you qualified to be teaching.</p>
<p>And not having liberation doesn't necessarily exclude you from being a good teacher.</p>
<p>I use two criteria.</p>
<p>To sort of.</p>
<p>Guess whether a person has had a liberation experience or not.</p>
<p>Notice that I said guess I can never be really sure, but I can make a pretty good. Guess the 2:00 criteria that I use our body language and personal behavior.</p>
<p>Now the body language is fairly easy. All you gotta do is look at them listen to them and so forth.</p>
<p>The personal behavior piece is hard because you have to hang out with them. You have to actually be there wife are there secretary or husband or a child something like that? To really know the personal behavior would have to be close to. That person over a long period of time, knowing the personal behavior is only something you can do in a relative way unless you happen to have a very special.</p>
<p>Close relationship.</p>
<p>Maybe a familiar with I should show.</p>
<p>So it's a combination of sort of the flow of emptiness an impermanence expressing itself in that person's body language. Voice gays and so forth that plus their personal behavior would be the 2:00 criteria. I would look for judge levels of enlightenment.</p>
<p>And even then I can like I say I can only guess but I can be fairly confident in that in those guesses.</p>
<p>There is a tricky thing, though about the body language, P Saute. It interesting story, I was once.</p>
<p>But driving in Santa Monica CA with senior student of mine.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>You know come from California, you might not know, but there's a lot of homeless people in Santa Monica and call Southern California. They sort of make it comfortable place for homeless People they're known for that, so all these homeless People there.</p>
<p>And we saw this homeless person.</p>
<p>And we looked at each other.</p>
<p>And it was one of those weird psychic moments where we knew we had had exactly the same thought.</p>
<p>And we had actually and we knew it and the thought was.</p>
<p>If you clean this guy up.</p>
<p>Put him in white clothes.</p>
<p>Put him in front of an audience and don't let him say anything.</p>
<p>But just let him.</p>
<p>Try to do his thing.</p>
<p>He would have something very close to the body language of something like master now that may be very shocking and all footing for some People to hear notice. I said the body language, not the mental state.</p>
<p>Apparently, a combination of mental illness and harsh life.</p>
<p>Had more or less driven the ego out of his body. What kind of Pseudo Enlightenment, actually but certainly not inviting you can have somebody that has the body language of no self.</p>
<p>But not really have a classical clear enlightenment type consciousness inside of now, you see why body vive is not enough. Then there has to be the behavior OK behavior of that person was of homeless, helpless in effect ineffectual. St person living by thanking so that's not the behavior typically of a qualified teacher in terms of.</p>
<p>Well, OK.</p>
<p>Besides sort of.</p>
<p>Is this person capable love dealing with the Enlightenment issue?</p>
<p>How do you know they're qualified?</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>The very first thing that pops into my head if somebody asks me.</p>
<p>How do you know if teachers qualified?</p>
<p>Is look at the students?</p>
<p>The virtue of the teacher is only in the results that that teacher can get with students as far as I'm concerned because there aren't kind of teachers that just the activity of teaching.</p>
<p>And so what's the effect.</p>
<p>Out of their students do somebody wants S Tony Robbins.</p>
<p>What his qualifications were for doing?</p>
<p>What he does?</p>
<p>Probably may know is well well known self help speaker.</p>
<p>And he said, because I don't know maybe there was an implication. He don't have any degree. You don't have any credibility? What gives you the right to tell People what to do and he said. Well, I have a degree in results.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>That's what I work for by those standards. There are some very enlightened teachers very enlightened individuals who are not very good teachers.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>There may be some teachers that haven't had a whole lot of enlightenment or.</p>
<p>Haven't had the deep experiences of some of the Great Masters. But they get really good results with People and they can deal with anything that a student is likely to go through so I would say those are the things that come to my mind. Look for body language and maybe that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to you don't know what I'm talking about is something you develop a sensitivity to unfortunate it's a little bit of a catch 22, you don't.</p>
<p>Sort of know what to look for until you start to become a little bit. That way yourself. Basically, what you're looking is to see is is there a flow of.</p>
<p>Empty enerji that sort of like.</p>
<p>Animating this person.</p>
<p>That's the body language, but that alone is not enough because they might just be crazy. So then you have to look for behavior are they gonna mention are they in ordinary good person.</p>
<p>And then what kind of results do they get with People, most would be some things that come to my mind, Apple quality issue of teacher?</p>
