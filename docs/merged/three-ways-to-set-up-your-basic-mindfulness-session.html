<p>You can either say, well, I don't want to deal with choices at all, and you pick one technique and that's what you do.</p>
<p>And so the basic mindfulness system was a catalog of techniques and.</p>
<p>You decided to buy one and take it home and that's it.</p>
<p>Another thing you can do is make a little workout sequence for yourself. Think of each one of the five ways.</p>
<p>As a piece of Nautilus equipment and you're going to go through this. Psycho spiritual workout cycle every morning something like that.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>The metaphor with physical exercise is actually rather extraordinary once you start to make the comparisons is at least a dozen places where the the metaphor just works absolutely perfectly, including ending with focus on positive being analogous to going into the jacuzzi. I mean, it's like perfectly analogous because not only is it a pleasant bomb.</p>
<p>After what might be a harsh reconstruction, but if you think about how exercise works.</p>
<p>Exercise doesn't make you strong exercise destroys muscle.</p>
<p>Exercises destructive but it's destructive in a way that helps nature.</p>
<p>Improve.</p>
<p>And the observing practices that we do in mindfulness. They deconstruct self and world. But in a way that helps nature reconstruct.</p>
<p>Better.</p>
<p>One of the things that helps the muscles rebuild in a good direction at the end is to go into the Whirlpool.</p>
<p>So one of the things that I mean, the deconstruction. We do would automatically move you in positive directions anyway anyway. But you can help it along by ending with this jacuzzi and focus on positive which tends to then foster that direction. So it's actually a very nice metaphor. So you could just buy buy one technique keep things simple OK. I like to do I like to do, noting restful states body mind version?</p>
<p>Relaxation peace blind quiet that's it. That's my practice.</p>
<p>Or you can make a little workout.</p>
<p>Sequence for yourself.</p>
<p>Natural sequence.</p>
<p>That I tend to follow is.</p>
<p>Focus in focus out.</p>
<p>Note restful states.</p>
<p>Focus on change.</p>
<p>And then do nothing.</p>
<p>And then</p>
<p>And with focus on positive but you can.</p>
<p>Workout any sequence you want.</p>
<p>Then.</p>
<p>The most complicated way to use it is, you sit down and you decide.</p>
<p>Which of these themes you'd like to pursue?</p>
<p>And you start to do it and then you either stay with it and that's it or interest opportunity necessity comes up and you decide OK. I think I'd like to switch to one of the other approaches and that's a looping and branching algorithm gives you a lot of flexibility. But at the price of complexity, so simplest thing you can do just choose one and that's fine.</p>
<p>Anyone of these ways.</p>
<p>At one time historically was an entire path to enlightenment.</p>
<p>So it's not like you know you're going to miss out on something if you do any one of them assiduously you should be able to get the classic results.</p>
<p>Or you don't want to be a little more elaborate than let's hit all the Psycho spiritual muscle groups and you have this little workout routine want to be really elaborate. Then we come into the 21st century, the age of the algorithm. So now now. It's a flow chart and you're looping and branching to keep your interest up in to optimize the Efficacy. When I interactively guide. You we go to the algorithm, we loop in branch.</p>
<p>And part of the reason that I set up the system this way is to optimize interactive guidance.</p>
