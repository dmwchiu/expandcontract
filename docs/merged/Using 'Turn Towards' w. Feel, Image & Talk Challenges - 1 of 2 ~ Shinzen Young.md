The questions.

Are always formulated in terms of specific emotions? How do I deal with this kind of emotion? How do I deal with that kind of emotion OK fear rage shame impatience grief bereavement, etc, etc.

But really

You deal with it all, and exactly the same way in in terms of the have a complete experience of it.

These the answer to all of these questions is the same answer.

If we're going to do a focus on it if we're taking that strategy, the IT, meaning now.

You name it anger fear sadness embarrassment in patients to discuss confusion.

Any of the emotional challenges.

Same basic principles apply?

Untangle and be free.

That's one really basic principle and then work with the parts work with the whole work with elements work with systems.

In other words, work at small scale of organization work at large scale alternate wide scope and the narrow scope.

So that you.

So to do pointed work with in the small scope and if you get quality work.

In all the different small scales, then you'll discover that that carries over into the large scale and the overall constellation loses a ceases to become a prison so these are the basic themes and you just do it over and over and over again, you set up the.

Apparatus the situation.

And you let time pass.

And when you have an intense emotional arising there's good news and there's bad news.

The good news is feel, and image am talk all three elements of probably pretty strongly activated.

When you get subtle emotional arisings.

Mid scale or micro scale emotions that come up in daily life. They may not noticeably activate all 3.

You might only be aware of the talk part for example.

So there is in a sense, something good about having a big emotional Vesuvius. I know there's also like something bad about it because it's like miserable right.

The opportunity is you probably have strong eruptions, not Justin talk space. But in image space and feel space. You remember the situation you relive the situation you rehearse about the situation. That's going to involve image space OK and then you've got the eruptions in field space better.

Definitely not subliminal OK, there's you know, there's the ache in your heart OK. There's the butterflies in your stomach. There's the cold fear up here a spine. There's the general shake over your whole body. There's the tightness in the jaw.

There's the I want to hit someone in the arms, etc, etc, etc. All the components are active. They're not subtly active it's all there.

So work with the parts work with the whole.

Focus for a little what's the weakest link often the weakest link his image. Space not inevitably. Of course, depending some People get some very strong things archetypal things weird things in image space, but I find for myself.

Among the 3:00 if I have an emotional upper upheaval typically the image is the weakest link.

An the next week is actually for me talk.

The most challenging is the field.

In the body.

Physical discomfort.

You can.

You know your body has a natural tendency to go into equanimity with physical discomfort physical discomforts just part of being an animal.

And it happens to animals, so the body sort of knows what to do.

Uncomfortable feel actually any all the field, not just uncomfortable feel.

Feel.

The somatic component of emotional experience.

When you're dealing with feel OK. I'm being poetic here, I don't feel understand.

You're fighting with Darwin.

You're dealing with something.

That has been honed over millions of years to control you.

It's been honed by evolution.

To control us?

To control our behavior.

It's been honed to be hard to have equanimity.

OK.

Crowned by evolutionary forces.

I don't know if you've ever had the experience of strong feel arising.

And getting the sense that.

This isn't just me.

That this is like the this thing that's happening in my body is the tip of an iceberg and it goes down and out and it's like everyone that ever had this.

Happened to them in their life all of millions and millions of sentient beings.

This is not just me, I mean, this is like the whole evolutionary.

Development of the limbic brain which goes back at least to advanced reptiles. This is the monitor lizard.

It's like these sensations have been fine tuned by the greatest engineering force known to us, which is evolution.

Sensations anger fear sadness embarrassment in patients discussed interest interest. You can't ignore either.

If you wonder why you're running all those entertaining fantasies OK just look for the interest flavor.

It's controlling you.

You think the minds controlling but the reason you're running those entertaining fantasies is the interest flavor is saying.

Fantasize entertain yourself and you'll get more of me.

They're designed.

To be

That we can't ignore them and it's hard to have equanimity with them, meaning the different flavors of feel it's hard to be matter of fact about them, much harder than it is with regards to physical discomfort.

However, they are just body sensations.

And.

When a person is 8 years old.

They are controlled by rage tear grief and shame.

Hopefully, by the time their 80 years old, they will have learned something but usually they haven't.

And why haven't, they because every time those sensations came up.

They could not be ignored and they could not be viewed matter effect.

That person never attempted to untangle.

Or just observe.

Ah, etc, etc.

No no growth in skill took place.

Over that lifetime.

So when it comes time to die and those things come up very strongly perhaps.

Free card city.

But good news.

We're in this situation where we can train ourselves.

Is this retreat environment?

Is?



It's vaccination against future suffering Stuffs coming up.

And we're retraining deep circuits.

So untangle.

What part is feel what part is image? What part is talk you can free float among them all or you can just tease out just the image for awhile just the talk, for awhile just the feel for awhile.

Tease them apart so that instead of multiplying together, they merely add.

And then tried to the best of your ability to totally open and affirm that.

Not press it down, but also to not hold on.

And it just takes time time practice practice practice.

If if that doesn't work.

Untangle in more detail.
