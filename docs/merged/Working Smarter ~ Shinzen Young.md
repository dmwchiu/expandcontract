Sometimes, when People first are introduced to your techniques. There can be a bit of an overwhelm 'cause. They're not prepared for the technical nature of them? What would you say to People to help them get through that initial?

Overwhelmed so that they stick around to get there.

Ultimate.

Simplicity and good stuff, it leads to.

I would say.

Uh.

Don't try to understand it get used to it.

There is a Japanese proverb Natale Jordan Ariel.

Which literally means that it's not a matter of learning it? It's a matter of getting accustomed to it?

Someone once asked a very prominent.

20th century mathematician John for Neumann.

About his mathematics that he had used during a lecture. They said professor from Neumann. I can't understand. Your math and he said. Math is not something you understand math is something you get used to.

And when I heard that it's was hugely helpful for me.

Um.

You listen and you think and you practice and you read and you listen and you think any practice and you read any listen and you think in your practice and read.

Over and over and over again and with time it sinks in.

There is a reason why I formulated that copious and precise vocabulary.



In the long run, it's going to hopefully allow People to work smarter.

Because the old fashioned way.

Where you have to just sort of discover it on your own and often it's a brute force method. You just have to put yourself through such horrific ordeals that at some point you're just forced.

To experience certain States and forced to certain things well. The average modern person is not going to intentionally put themselves through that kind of thing.

So my idea was.

OK, instead of the brute force methods if we can make the formulation crystal clear.

Yes, up front, it takes a little bit of work because it's like we're being sent back to school. It's like. Watt, I have to like learn vocabulary. I have to learn definitions. I have to make subtle distinctions with regards to things that seem irrelevant or that I haven't experienced so I do understand that People have that resistance at the beginning, there's always.

Strong points and weak points in every way of working the weak point in the way that I work. One of them is that up front your *** to really carefully think about the nature of sensory experience to have a classificatory system for sensory experience. It also for the things that lead beyond sensory experience and it's described in a vocabulary.

That is something like the rigor and precision that we would find in mathematics, so it's like wow that you're right? That's a major stumbling block for People because they don't expect to have to.

Alarm work that way I think you're coming to a retreat. You know it's going to be Zen, poetry and finger pointing to the easy moons and suddenly it's like calculus? What am I doing here. However, my idea is that for that relatively small investment up front.

In the end, it will allow them to work smarter and be able to achieve the classic goals. I don't necessarily say faster, but with less.

Necessity for Horiffic Intensities 'cause when you hear about sort of traditional trainings that are done and you're tracking monastery monastic intensities, like whoa who wants to put themselves through that kind of thing, so my idea is by giving People this very precise vocabulary and having them maybe work, a little smarter.

That, in the end, that will allow them to have comparable depth of experience, but still have their normal North American or modern. Let's say comfortable lifestyle. So yes, it's some investment up front, but I think number one if they realize.

How much it's going to help down the line and #2 if they just take it gradually just gradually get used to it. That's what I would say with regards to take a break and easing up bearing down and easing up to balance so that if they've been working very hard, they can.

Ease up and do something.

That would be less intense well, I think you're asking with regards to learning the vocabulary is actually well. I I was actually talking about you know first coming in with all the five ways. And all the techniques and that potential overwhelmed. I remember before the five ways. When I first went to one of your retreats. I said, You know, I was in an on line with you and I said, You know this is like playing scales this is.

This is you know this is technical work. I'm having to pay attention and really play scales and I stopped being a classical musician. 'cause I didn't want to practice my scales and you said it is like playing scales, but the music is your life.

An I thought.

Good answer you know that said that you're developing this skill.

To use in your life well, I would say that.

The reason I present people with.

Several approaches is not that I necessarily want them to learn how to do all those approaches. I would like them to be exposed to a range of possibilities. So that they can find what works for them. Some People like the flexibility of having 5 contrasting ways of working. But some People like the will just choose one of those 5.

And aside that's all I'm going to go for but at least they can see the the range of what is available and then so the idea is not that you have to learn this giant system?

The idea is all you have to do is find 1.

Good technique that works for you and then if you want to just stay with that fine.

If you want to learn other things that's fine, too, so I think the combination of realizing that you only need one good technique, plus giving yourself time to get used to the vocabulary and take it slowly plus realizing that the complexity. The scrupulous precision will in the end payoff.

Because you'll be able to work smarter get more bang for the Buck so to speak. I think keeping that in mind may help People, a little bit with the challenges of studying meditation with the Demented Physic Cesar.

Somebody once called me amended physics, yes, I like that, you can use it.
