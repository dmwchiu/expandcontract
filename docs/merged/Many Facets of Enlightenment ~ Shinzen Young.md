How much does the path one takes?

Thoards enlightenment affect the nature of the.

Enlightenment be quick and easy answer is if you were to focus only on the breath and come to an enlightenment experience through that.

It would be Essentia Lee, the same kind of experience that a person would have if they did a more systematic deconstructive path or if they did a reconstructive path like the Vad Rihanna Path, where you sort of create an alternate identity from scratch. That's archetypal. I would say they all take you to Essentia Lee, the same.

Type of experience, but Having said that.

The confounding factor is that although it's essentially the same ballpark.

Enlightenment is like a many faceted jewel there's so many different sides to it.

So what side you're going to emphasize may slightly be influenced by what path you took.

But not necessarily you might take a certain path there and when you get there decide to emphasize something quite different. In contrast to what the path was that took you. There also unfolds with time. One of my teachers used to say cure know Satori while I start know much you got that means today's enlightenment is to models mistake, not mistaken the sense of fundamental mistake but in the sense of well.

Newtonian physics is basically right, but Einstein had something to say.

An then Richard Feynman had something else to say that built on this so it's like science. It's many faceted so it will present itself to you over the years in different aspects.

So who for example, my main teachers, Sasaki Roshi. When I met him. He was already a Masters Master. I mean he was already a senior Roshi when I first met him.

Is now 100?

203.

I've known him for 2526 years now over those 2, 1/2, decades, I have seen him evolve.

And hone is paradigm and changes emphasis so he was already in Masters Master and he is discovering new facets of this.

At that at that level so I would say that.

The path that you take, will somewhat influence how you conceptualize the experience but.

Not it's not necessarily going to constrain it in some way and in fact, you may end up doing something quite different ending up with quite a different paradigm.

So I would say it's a matter of depth and what facet you're choosing to emphasize, rather than a matter of what?

Technique you use to bring you to that.
