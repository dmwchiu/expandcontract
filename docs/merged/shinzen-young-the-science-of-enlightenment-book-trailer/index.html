<p>What if you could tap into the intellectual joy of understanding the science behind it?</p>
<p>And what if you could use that joy and clarity to work smarter in your practice.</p>
<p>You discover that nature is constantly providing windows to transcendence and you get even more mileage out of your practice and its application to your everyday life.</p>
<p>The concept of enlightenment would be within your grasp.</p>
<p>It's often said that the things experienced by advanced meditators cannot be put into words, but I disagree.</p>
<p>And I've dedicated the last 40 years of my life to the Endeavour of creating a precise in Iaccessible language for describing what happens as the result of deep meditation practice.</p>
<p>By working smarter and knowing how to spot nature's windows of opportunity. More People will have the tools to benefit from meditation and more People would flourish in their existing practice.</p>
<p>Imagine how that could change our world.</p>
<p>In my senior year of college, I studied abroad in Japan. During that year. I was befriended by some Zen monks.</p>
<p>I sensed that they had a kind of secret sauce away to be deeply happy independent of conditions.</p>
<p>Eventually I decided to discover for myself what they were talking about.</p>
<p>I knew I would meditate my whole life and probably eventually get good at it.</p>
<p>But I was also impressed by the power of modern science and technology.</p>
<p>So I decided to train myself in physics and mathematics, as well.</p>
<p>I currently divide my time between teaching meditation and designing research related to it.</p>
<p>I derive great joy from discovering parallels between mathematical structures and meditative experiences.</p>
<p>And I like to think of myself as being on a mission to take the missed out of mysticism.</p>
<p>Many People are quite pessimistic regarding the future.</p>
<p>Degradation of the environment senseless violence economic chaos and political extremism. All seemed to bode ill for Humanity in this century.</p>
<p>Of course, it's impossible to predict the future.</p>
<p>But there's a very real possibility that the marriage of the best of the East and the W could pull the bacon out of the fire and lead to a dramatic improvement of the human condition.</p>
<p>This reasonable and reassuring thought fuels my days.</p>
<p>What if informing meditation with the spirit of science ends up creating the tight Geist for the next century?</p>
<p>I wrote the science of enlightenment to bring that dialogue to a broader audience and I invite you to join me.</p>
<p>And take your meditation practice further than you may have thought possible.</p>
