<p>Not hard to imagine it's seeing progress of People that study with me.</p>
<p>That's the most rewarding thing.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>And that progress takes various forms.</p>
<p>Some People experience little progress little pieces of progress.</p>
<p>Every once in awhile somebody actually has.</p>
<p>A major insight.</p>
<p>So that's what's rewarding for me as a teacher's seeing the progress of the students. I only judge my worth as a teacher in terms of the progress of the student Confucius said not to learn is the students fault.</p>
<p>Not to teach is the teacher's fault.</p>
<p>I disagree.</p>
<p>If.</p>
<p>If the student doesn't learn it's not the students fault.</p>
<p>It's The teachers fault it's my fault.</p>
<p>In other words, it's the job of the teacher to make it possible for the student to learn.</p>
<p>We can't say, Oh well, you don't have the right karma or whatever it's like if they're not getting it. It's on me, it's not on that.</p>
<p>So to find the way to communicate with that, you're talking about communication skills. Well, yes, well so you ask nicely doing a transmission that you asked me what's most most rewarded in general? What's most rewarding is when the students make progress.</p>
<p>If a student happens to have a classical liberation experience.</p>
<p>Now, which happens occasionally the sudden kinds of things.</p>
<p>That of course, is really, really good.</p>
<p>So that's extremely rewarding.</p>
<p>The other rewarding thing is for me.</p>
<p>Is if I can figure out something new something that hasn't been tried before that works like you do on a daily basis is coming up with something new well go around with a notebook.</p>
<p>I mean, I would say that.</p>
<p>Although I've been guiding People for some 35 years I learn something new everyday.</p>
<p>And I take notes on my own process.</p>
<p>And you know every once in awhile I get these epiphanies of creativity with regards to how you can teach People.</p>
<p>And when I get one of those that's really, really good.</p>
<p>That's extremely fulfilling my try it out and it actually works.</p>
<p>My ultimate goal as a teacher is that anything I have personally experienced.</p>
<p>I could lead anybody else to that experience that's what I set for myself as as my goal.</p>
<p>Goodwill.</p>
