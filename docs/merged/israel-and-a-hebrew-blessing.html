<p>That was a Hebrew blessing. I guess you probably figured it was. He put when you heard the word. Shalom over and over again in the word is Israel is crying.</p>
<p>So for me the word Israel.</p>
<p>There is like Medina, Israel, there's the country. The modern nation, state of Israel. Then there's the land of Israel just what that land does then there's the Jewish people.</p>
<p>But then when I think of the word. Israel just that word alone. I don't think of a particular ethnic group or a country or even region of the world if you go back historically where the word is.</p>
<p>This guy L came from.</p>
<p>It was a name given to the 3rd Patriarch.</p>
<p>Send patriarchs 3rd Patriarch in the Jewish Linneage, who was.</p>
<p>Well, there was Avraham, it's hot, yeah, arc of Jarco Jacob.</p>
<p>So Jacob.</p>
<p>Was?</p>
<p>Try was struggled.</p>
<p>Struggled with the forces that were making it difficult to climb the ladder to the source OK, so anybody who struggling to go up that ladder, which is all of humanity to me anyway. When I use that when I think of that word so that was a famous blessing that says Shalom bit model moth who we are says Shalom Alenu Coleus Ryan.</p>
<p>They, in blue are Mens is what I chanted so what's cool about it is.</p>
<p>That I won't go into a whole discussion. But the way that words are formed in in Semitic languages like Arabic, Hebrew, and Aramaic, which is the language that Jesus spoke.</p>
<p>They are formed from Tri Continental routes typically that means there are 3 consonants that carry a general sense of meaning and then you stick vowels and other consonants in there to form verbs nouns and to make nuances of meaning so Shin Lamid. Mem those 3 Hebrew letters.</p>
<p>They.</p>
<p>Mean.</p>
<p>The peace that comes through completing.</p>
<p>Chelan means complete.</p>
<p>And Shalom is peace that's related concepts. You complete something and then there is a piece.</p>
<p>That comes and that's exactly how it works isn't it when you have a complete experience. There is this extraordinary piece of.</p>
<p>The divine nothingness.</p>
<p>That is the where, when you complete the sensory experience.</p>
<p>It's it goes from particle to wave and then when the wave returns.</p>
<p>To the source.</p>
<p>In that nothingness is true absolute rest.</p>
<p>But it's the rest. It's a rich nothingness because it has all this completeness about it and the word Nirvana.</p>
<p>Has that sort of connotation it's like ultimate rest?</p>
<p>Cessation but also.</p>
<p>Total fulfillment so I gave an entire Dharma talk.</p>
<p>In Israel on Shin Laman men taking it through many of the different permutations that it has in the Hebrew language. And this is very much by the way in the mode of rabbis. This is how they do there.</p>
<p>They're teaching they play with the words and so forth so I was like really cool because it's like you can explain the entire practice of that arma in terms of those, 3 letters so anyway. Oh say Shalom Beamer, Oh my love.</p>
<p>Who yeah sesh alone?</p>
<p>May.</p>
<p>He or that.</p>
<p>Which creates the piece of heaven?</p>
<p>Make peace upon you.</p>
<p>And all is real.</p>
<p>Cesselon beam road map. We are special own Elena upon you very end. Our call Israel. All of Israel, which is I say I understand us all of humanity.</p>
<p>'Cause we're all struggling to get up that ladder to the source.</p>
<p>VE Imru and say our main probably recognize that words that origin of the English word on that, so anyway. That's what that was my rabbi used to say that lot. I remember it from my kids, so I thought it's a nice makes a nice thing for the at the end of the loving kindness practice.</p>
<p>Sex Charlo, the more.</p>
<p>Me ask your Z.</p>
<p>The Long Z.</p>
<p>We me no.</p>
<p>Moo all the</p>
