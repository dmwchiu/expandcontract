Well, this is really interesting because this to me, this is the modern who pia.



We're reaching out to People now, what I decided to do was OK if.

If we're flying under the banner of unintentional skill set.

Well, we want.

Them to apply these skills.

In a way that they are going to dramatically grow so.

The base, I outlined this in the what is mindfulness, but this old strategy is so the categories of the basic mindfulness system are designed to produce insights right off the bat.

So that it's not just that they're going to get a little bit of of concentration kind of thing, but there explicitly developing concentration sensory clarity equanimity and they're learning how to parse their sensory experience in such a way that the fundamental insights can arise without a bus trying to get them to leave a certain thing. So we're going to provide you with an intentional skill set.

We're going to provide you with the way of.

Analyzing your sensory experience, which is not any doctrine or belief system. It's obviously is the case that we see and we hearing we feel.

And then People can hopefully start to have.

Really significant experiences.

So.

That to me is the is a modern incredible opportunity for Empire.
