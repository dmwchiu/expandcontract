Sometimes People ask me is there a really quick way to enlightenment. There's gotta be a quicker way lot of you know what's coming. This is a standard story that I tell.

Which is well?

Are you sure you want to know?

Maybe you won't like what you hear.

Yeah.

I can tell you some pretty quick ways.

To transform deeply?

Strong determination sitting.

It's a classic.

I won't say that every master has done it.

But I would say that the great majority of People that.

Come to the master level on this path.

Have done a lot of strong determination city.

So what does that mean that means that you sit down?

An you say OK for the next hour or the next 90 minutes or 2 hours or 3 or 4 whatever 3 days?

Not going to voluntarily move.

So.

Right now, the prospect of something like that seems.

***** Riffic.

It might not imagine yourself doing that, well first of all.

I said it could just be an hour or 90 minutes, OK doesn't have to be 3 days.

Uh.

Secondly.

Even if it was 4 hours or 8 hours.

This is not so.

Extravagantly.

Um.

All unrelated to experience is that normal human beings have.

In fact, I would suggest to you, that at least half of all human beings that ever lived.

Oh.

I've been through an experience comperable and intensity.

Do you get what I'm talking about?

OK.

Uh.

Sitting sitting for 8 hours and breaking through a posture is not more intensive giving birth to a baby.

If you done that OK now of course, it's a different circumstance so I mean, first of all there's no way out.

Secondly, there's a lot to distract and, yes, nowadays their medications and so forth, but the way. Most People had to give birth to babies for most of humanity human, Humanities history.



It was, I think it was nature's way too.

Bring that person to a permanent transcendence sort of makes sense right you're doing the activity of the source.

Spanning and contracting.

It's interesting I talked about the Sundance yesterday native People.

So the story that sold among the Lakota Sioux is that?



It originally son dancing was for men only.

All.

Not innocence women even children actually.

The men wanted to know what it was like to give birth.

So if you look at the symbolism of the Sundance the men wear skirts like women.

And.

They you're attached by a tether pierced.

Which is symbolic of the umbilical cord?

And then you have to break those and that's like.

Being born, etc like new new birth actually in the old days after after their 4th year of Son Dancing.

They considered that they had died and were a completely new person.

And it actually gave away all their possessions like everything.

Although teepees and Ponies and that everything they just like started from scratch as a new person.

Um.

OK so even though it's sort of sounds like really far out there is actually no more than what at least half of humans do.

But at the good news is strong determination sitting you can gradually work up to you train yourself slowly to be able to do this kind of thing.

So the

Aw.

There's one absolute rule.

Do not do not do not physically damage the body.

So how are you going to know if you're physically damage in the body well remember you gradually train yourself to do this right. It's a slow training so sit for an hour. He got some pain you get up. It goes away. You're OK, Yeah, but damage the body.

Then you know you add 5 minutes, 5 minutes, 5 minutes and as long as you getting up and after a few minutes. You're OK, then you're OK, I can assure you that with rare exceptions.

Most People can sit down for 4 hours and not move and get up and they haven't like damaged any joints or anything like that, but you gradually learn how to do this, or by the way your legs, falling asleep isn't going to damage anything, it's not you're not cutting off circulation so much. It's more pressure on nerves that causes that paresthesia thing and that as you notice.

Disappears as soon as you get up.

There might occasionally be exceptions, where People have neurological or circulatory issues so if you wonder about that check check it with the doctor, but usually it's not that big a deal. The main the main danger in your legs, falling asleep is not massive necrosis that you might be fantasizing that issues are dying made danger is if you try to.

Get up too quickly your legs will not hold you and you fall. I've seen some really far out. You know, People that didn't know that, like in Zenon clackers going on OK. Everybody jumps up and they just like through a somersault and crosses and so, yeah, I have to get up so.

What's involved in a strong determination sitting well.

You're going to have.

4 things arise.

You're going to have physical sensations.

And those are going to get more and more and more intense for sure.

And then you're going to have your thoughts and emotions that you will and your desire and your judgments on rising moment by moment reactively to that.

So that's a pretty big object that's the whole mind body self that's why.

If you can have a complete experience of that.

It's a powerful transcendence and that's why as I say not everyone that becomes a master but in Asian style training.

Awful lot of People that become Masters.

They do this.

So.

So what's going to happen well.

You start to get physical discomfort now, what I usually do this is my own personal strategy.

You'll find whatever strategy works for you, if you decide to do things like this.

But my personal strategy is.

2.

Start by detecting the global spread of the pain rather than going immediately to the local intensity.

That's see that's

Sort of the

The sensory clarity skill.

After you get really intimate with the body you realize that the body is like a pond an not always but quite often when there's a local physical or emotional splash.

There's a global ripple.

And.

One of the options within the noting apparatus.

Is what I call zooming you can zoom in that you can zoom out and consume both ways so zooming both ways means that you.

Thrust your attention into the local splash. But so that's contracted but at the same time you spread your attention over the whole body.

So you sort of zoom in and out at the same time now, what that does.

Is?

That Greece is the rails so to speak.

For sensations to dissipate in the volume of the body itself analogous to boyles law in physical chemistry pressure is inversely proportional to volume.

If pressure is analogous to suffering.

So.

Here's how that works so when you zoom into a local intensity. Of course, that becomes very salient.

It intensifies even more.

But at the same time you're zooming out.

Now, one of two things will happen either. There will be conscious sensations that are spreading from that local intensity.

And the zoo with the zooming out you'll be able to detect that and open up to it and facilitate that.

The other possibility is that actually there aren't conscious spreading sensations. And that's fine. It's not always the case that there are conscious, spreading sensation.

But it is almost always the case with rare exception.

That there are subconscious, spreading sensations going on now an important principle in mindfulness is we only ask you to attend to what is available in conscious experience?

Spot so don't worry if you don't detect any of that subliminal spread. But here's the subtlety of the of the technique that sort of cleverness of the option.

If you spread your awareness over the whole body.

Zoom out while you zoom in.

Then even if there's not a conscious awareness of the spread of the sensation. The movement of your attention over the whole body greases. The rails for the subconscious processing.

To spread without impeded so you don't may not consciously. Be aware but you're giving the very subtle, spreading tendencies of the body? What they need to dissipate the density of things so.

That's one possible strategy for doing it, so anyway, I tend to sort of try to get the.

The local splash of the global ripple.

And then at some point.

All I start to freak out.

So where does the freak outcome well the freak out is in the subjective system?

I start to go Oh my God, Oh my God, no no OK and I start to get like disconcerting images of being stabbed and burned and you know.

What have you Palm and then the emotions start to come up in the body subtle hint that eeriness?

All local here there's a?

There is a kind of cold.

Spear thing that sort of like pervades the body.

Subtle but subtle is significant.

Those see in here in Feelin reactions are natural.

Uh if you contract them and I blocked them, they won't be a problem.

If you can't.

Then they're going to cross multiply with the physical sensations.

And so instead of.

CN plus here and plus feel in, plus fill out.

You're going to get see in times here in times, Feelin times fill up.

That's why if you ever noticed.

It's like I can handle it, I can handle it, I can handle I know normally I can't handle.

It's not linear right, it's not like.

It grows like this, it grows like this that's because things are starting to cross multiply.

But if you have enough clarity to separate out the strands so that they don't.

Oh.

They don't tangle and reinforce each other than actually it just grows linearly.

And, yes, it gets more more more, but you don't get this sort of like.

Uh.

Snowballing overwhelmed thing.

It just grows girls girls girls girls crumbs crumbs crumbs crumbs and then.

Something happens.

And then

Cons Girls girls girls girls girls red and then it just flows flows flows flows.

And then yeah, you go through another cycle and it's like it's a little more.

And then this follows for us folks what's the whole mind body process.

Um.

It's scary because the ordinary ordering principle is completely unavailable.

The ordinary ordering principle of the body is get comfortable the ordinary ordering principle for the mind is get answers. An you can't do by there that those are just not available. The mind can't process. It's fact here eyes are sort of rolling in your head.

And you're right on the verge of passing out.

Um.

But.

You got a smile on your face.

Because you are moment by moment tasting purification.

And so you're getting an immediate reward.

Um.

Once again this may sound radical, but half the people in this room have done this.

I remember back if you had kids.

Uh.

So it's just a matter of doing it.

And I'll really systematic way.

Um.

So.

That's

That's a really big object the whole mind body self.

But.

If we appreciate it to the extreme.

Just as it is.

Then, at some point, it becomes flowing space.

Gradually gradually gradually work your way up to this snot. It's a homework assignment, you got the rest of your life to turn him.

Um.

And you don't have to do it if you don't want to you can just follow the path of Bliss that John's the absorptions? What have you that works too?
