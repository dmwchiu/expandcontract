<p>Likes to have style with their presentations that is exemplified by the name of the studio sounds true.</p>
<p>In other words, they don't like their authors to read materials that doesn't sound true. They want the author to extemporize. The material so that's how we made the science of enlightenment. It was really cool. We did it in Cala Rado, where their studios are located and what they did is they got.</p>
<p>About a dozen or so of my students.</p>
<p>To come every day for Gee. I think about a week, actually and just listen to me talk all day In other words, they set on a mailing to my students in Colorado, who would like to do this gotta come to the studio everyday an they'll be chairs. And I'm going to talk to you and just give you a brain dump of my understanding.</p>
<p>Of the meditative path, so that it will have that quality of being spontaneous and spoken so that's how we did it. I did have a general outline of what I was going to talk about on cards, but nothing specific certainly not any text or anything, but it's like OK. There's this topic. This topic this topic. So I had those cards and I had the audience.</p>
<p>And I just blabber UHD all day into the microphone for about a week and they came every single day, the same People came and they listened to it, so that there was that sense of presents that I was really talking to somebody so it had that sounds that sound of truth to it that Tammy, who created sounds true, so much values in her.</p>
<p>Products so that's how we did it and in the end, we had twice the length of material that appeared in the actual.</p>
<p>And product so that had to be edited and it took months for Michael Taft, who is this very.</p>
<p>Very sharp and intelligent guy to edit it down to cut it in half of what we had dumped and that became that classic that so many People have found useful I should say that Michael and I are now working on a text version of it hired him to do that. We thought we would just transcribe it and do a little touch up.</p>
<p>Vetting and whatever but it turns out, we're going to need a radical makeover. So it's taken on a lot more time than any of us thought but.</p>
<p>There will be a book based on the science of enlightenment that should come out sometime in the next kalpa.</p>
