You'll remember I describe feel image talk as the course objective system that's the world of thought and emotion. We have internal control over it to a certain extent, particularly talk, we can decide to.</p>
<p>Create a certain talk an repeated over and over again, essentially that's a mantra practice. But it's also a cognitive therapy practice. You can if you have irrational going on irrational cognitions that our word based you can selectively attend to the antidote to that which would be a more rational cognition.</p>
<p>And in cognitive behavioral therapy that's what they have People do well. I would say that that person is intentionally, creating and holding positive talk positive in the sense of rational as opposed to irrational or appropriate as opposed to inappropriate we can also hold positive images. Once again, they can be either more rational images or they can be images of behavior changes or performance.</p>
<p>Improvements that we would like to make or images of outcomes that we would like to see happen or images of symbols archetypes that represent spiritual goals for us or just images of People places objects that make us feel good that activate pleasant emotional feel that would be an antidote to uncomfortable emotions depression fear and so forth.</p>
<p>It's pretty easy for most People to intentionally create a positive dimension in talk and hold that little harder for image. But doable by many People feel is even harder, but it's doable. You can actually learn in a systematic way to turn on positive feel by that. I mean, pleasant feel that would be interest. Joy love gratitude, those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Compassion.</p>
<p>Intentionally creating holding an radiating positive states in one.</p>
<p>Or, a pear or all three of the fit system. I call that approach focus on positive.</p>
