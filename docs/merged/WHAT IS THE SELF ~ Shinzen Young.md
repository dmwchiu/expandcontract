Can you explain to me? What is the self so you have thoughts correct?

And have you notice that those thoughts tend to occur constantly right lot of thoughts you also have body sensations.

Now Have you ever notice that some of those thoughts are visual like you have memory plan fantasy scenes?

But some of them are auditory also right here dialogues monologues.

And your body some of the sensations are purely physical right, but when you have strong emotions pleasant or unpleasant.

You also experienced them as changes in your body sensation right.

So you have mental experience that consists of visual and auditory thoughts and it's continuous.

And you have body sensations, some of which are physical. Some of which are emotional and they're pretty continuous, too right. So you're constantly pulled to mental States and body states.

And nothing mysterious so far, no anyone can see that you've probably also notice that when a thought arises you tend to say this is me, this thought is me right right and I bought your body experience. We even said. You're right these sensations. There me right, especially if their emotional right a brokenly is me.

But a broken heart is in some ways, even more me an emotional sensation. So you've noticed how moment by moment. There's a lot of thoughts.

But we can analyze them sensorially into something visual and something auditory and you've noticed how moment by moment you have physical sensations for sure, and sometimes emotional.

It's incessant and you also notice that as soon as a body stay Dora Mindstate arises.

You tend to say this is me these are my thoughts. This is my body, so to sum it up.

You're going to get different answers, depending on who you ask and those answers are all legitimate.

Of the different perspectives on the word self. But for me. The simplest way to think about self is self is a moment by moment experience.

And that experience consists of mind and body and mind his mental image and mental talk.

Body is physicality and emotionality. So, your mental images your mental talk your physical and emotional.

Experience is what you identify with moment by moment and that is the ordinary experience of self.
