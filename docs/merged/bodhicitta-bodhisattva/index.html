<p>Which I relate to pre Buddhist shamanic things I mean? I've been in sweat lodges with like fully traditional Lakota Sioux.</p>
<p>Telly talking about their experiences in Visionquest, where they would have this vision of all of humanity. And they knew it was there and they would see the People suffering OK and they could see the whole world and then they had this calling they knew it was their job to care, etc, etc. I think this is.</p>
<p>You know something that is by no means this distinct to Buddhism, but in Buddhism is sort of codified as the Bodie Sodfa ideal. There's the rising of Mahayana Buddhism, historically about 2000 years ago.</p>
<p>So about 500 years after the?</p>
<p>The Mahayana literature has 2 themes. There's there's this sort of like OK car analysis important as Prochnau. In other words, the compassion, meaning broadly service. Love you know, etc? What you put out into the world is now philosophically on an equal footing with deliberating wisdom so that's that's one thing that was characteristic of mouhanna literature and the other thing that was characteristic of Mahal out of literature is everything is empty.</p>
<p>There's no one to save that's the approach now part of me to you know that's my on a text the Mahayana critique of early Buddhism.</p>
<p>And our words, they say, Well, there's 2 things wrong with early Buddhism.</p>
<p>One is</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>Although the practice of service may have been there, it was.</p>
<p>Not philosophically emphasized so early Buddhism sounds like spiritual, selfish, hence the term. He now on our small vehicle and then the other thing they say that was wrong with early Buddhism is that they thought that what you get to know self buy.</p>
<p>Teasing apart the Skanda's right, but you have to realize that.</p>
<p>The thunders themselves are empty as is everything so it's not just that there's no thing called itself. There's no thing.</p>
<p>And that's the shooting Nevada or teachings about emptiness so those 2 are Co arise that's like.</p>
<p>We gotta save the world that really not there and sort of getting those 2 clearly that's the bodhichitta.</p>
<p>After the night.</p>
<p>Comes the dawn.</p>
<p>It's a natural cycle.</p>
<p>After the impersonal.</p>
<p>Comes the personal.</p>
<p>The return of the human the same.</p>
<p>But changed for the better.</p>
<p>Focus on positive.</p>
<p>If possible, directly from the nothingness and the Energi.</p>
<p>Let the self.</p>
<p>Be remade resurrected.</p>
<p>Kinder.</p>
<p>More fulfilled.</p>
<p>Rejoicing in service.</p>
<p>At all levels.</p>
<p>Boaty chetta.</p>
<p>Portage it the powder.</p>
<p>The spontaneous upwelling.</p>
<p>Of the bodhisatva aspiration.</p>
