Interviews Shinzen Young</h1></header><article><div><span><p>So to describe the unhealthy way the unhealthy way is that you don't have precision about what's happening where?</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>You're constantly fighting with whatever's happened they might be saying, I'm going to get rid of this. I gotta get rid of this again. It's like no, I don't want this and you tighten around it. Mentale an emotionally OK, so you're fighting with it at many levels of your being both on the surface and then the depths and you're not precise about exactly what's happening where when?</p>
<p>That's an unhealthy turning twords the sensory challenge.</p>
<p>So you're feeding it in a way by doing that. That's a very good way to put it, it's feeding the fire.</p>
<p>Now, most People think well if I focus on it, I will automatically be feeding. The fire fight focus on it, the worse. It's going to get however, that is profoundly not true. If you've been trained in systematic techniques.</p>
<p>The systematic techniques will teach you how to?</p>
<p>Untangle the components of the experience so they don't multiply into overwhelm you'll learn how to separate this part is the physical body. This part is the emotional body. This part is the visual thought this part is the.</p>
<p>Auditory the mental talk. Let's say that a person comes to you and they say I'm suffering at level.</p>
<p>Or you say what's your suffering? How much are you suffering right now.</p>
<p>And they say I'm suffering at the maximum possible what's that number, they say well.</p>
<p>10,000. OK. It's 10,000 it's like totally over the Top.</p>
<p>Maximum possible human suffering.</p>
<p>That's because they are turning towards the discomfort.</p>
<p>In an unskillful way.</p>
<p>If they were to turn their attention towards the discomfort with the discipline skill.</p>
<p>That allows you to separate.</p>
<p>The components.</p>
<p>OK, what they would discover is that that number 10,000.</p>
<p>Is a rising due to 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 because all those 4 channels are on to it?</p>
<p>Not because they're all on.</p>
<p>But because they're all on and their crisscrossing and multiplying with each other? How do you separate?</p>
<p>The channels and go to one at a time. How would someone do that in meditation. We use a technique called mindfulness that will teach you.</p>
<p>In a discipline way out of focus on each one individually.</p>
<p>So you tease them out and then when they happen collectively.</p>
<p>Instead of 10, * 10, * 10, * 1010 times, Tennis Endered, another 10, * 10, is another hundred 100, * 100, is 10,000 right so you kind of pull apart that gets dropped in it's no longer addition, alt it's just.</p>
<p>For things.</p>
<p>And your perception is now exactly what is there?</p>
<p>10 + 10 + 10 + 10 and they're all in one at a time well. You first learn how to have them one at a time, but then you can hold them all at once. But it still just 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 rather than 10 * 10 because now their separate even when they're happening all at the same time, so do the math. If we say that without changing your sensory experience at all.</p>
<p>But by merely changing your ability to separate it into its natural atoms.</p>
<p>If we were to say to a person I'm going to take you from suffering at 10,000 to suffering 40.</p>
<p>I'm going to take a �10,000 weight off your chest, but you will have to carry 40 pounds.</p>
<p>Sounds like a deal it's a big reduction, I mean that's a.</p>
<p>It's from it goes from.</p>
<p>Hopeless overwhelmed, too, OK, I can handle it, and how do you would you suggest they deal with it if say they're feeling the feeling?</p>
<p>What do you have to do?</p>
<p>They have to be trained in specific exercises In other words, it's not so much. I'm going to now describe to you. In 2 minutes and you're going to be able to do it. Yeah, you. You have to find a teacher or listen to a CD that teaches those techniques and you just follow those exercises.</p>
<p>And so I guess that you know, I would say well. How do you get strong the quick answers go to the gym and do the Nautilus cycle but you have to actually go and have somebody show, you how to do. The Nautilus Cycle. So you need a person or an interactive website or to teach you how to do that. But I'm giving you the theory right so the theory says divide and conquer.</p>
<p>So there's a way of focusing on it where you first break it up into its components.</p>
<p>Now you've gone from 10,040. That's pretty good. That means 10 + 10 + 10 + 10. Now let's look at each one of those 10.</p>
<p>Is there really 10 there?</p>
<p>Or.</p>
<p>Is there really one there?</p>
<p>That's being multiplied by 10:00 because of resistance so that's interesting.</p>
<p>And it turns out, it's going to be the going to be that so now we train away the resistance, the.</p>
<p>Learning to tease out the strands is the part of mindfulness that is sensory clarity. The training away. The resistance is the part of mindfulness that is equanimity. You also need concentration power, so you can focus on one strand at a time in order to.</p>
<p>Be able to learn about each one so we teach your concentration clarity and equanimity that allows you to separate the strands and then reduce the resistance to each strand so now we've gone from 10,000 to 4, which essentially?</p>
<p>Says that for all intensive purposes. We have illuminated you're suffering even though the physical pain.</p>
<p>The emotional sensation and the thoughts and the mental talk are still there.</p>
<p>They're still there.</p>
<p>They're not in the way.</p>
<p>It's a miracle it's hard to believe that this could happen. We call it the miracle of mindfulness.</p>
<p>That's a healthy way.</p>
<p>To bring your attention to it.</p>
<p>And it's very fortunate for us, human beings that that strategy exists.</p>
<p>'Cause you may attempt to turn away on to something restful positive rounding.</p>
<p>And you may find your camp do it, it's just so much in your face, saying do it.</p>
<p>Then you've got this other way of work.</p>
<p>Just to recap get the big picture if you have a health situation and he would like to use your focus power to deal with that.</p>
<p>Be clear.</p>
<p>Am I using it to change the situation objectively.</p>
<p>Oramai cultivating a skill that broadly reduces suffering and may change, it, the object of situation too.</p>
<p>Or am I doing both.</p>
<p>I would suggest that a person can do one.</p>
<p>The other.</p>
<p>Or both.</p>
<p>But I would.</p>
<p>Hope that they not do neither and there's one other technique do either is another technique that I think we haven't mentioned that much, which is focusing on the positive.</p>
<p>As a part of the what you've just elucidated so that would be that would come under the category of focus away focus on the positive comes under the category if by positive you being positive mental images mental to remind me again of build Bankston's recommendations to people with cancer was to focus on seeing themselves well doing whatever they're doing because they will so there's no focus at all.</p>
<p>On the cancer is shrinking cancer but it's visualizing themselves doing what they would be doing. Most happily in their lives because they're completely well very good, so I think we've pretty much covered the field. Thank you so much. That's very, very helpful. My pleasure and you have a website that People can link to to help with.</p>
<p>Learn all this stuff. Yes, yes, they can go to basicmindfulness.org it's all there.</p>
