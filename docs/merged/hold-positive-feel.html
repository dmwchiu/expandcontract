<p>A situation in my life that really.</p>
<p>Threw me off course.</p>
<p>My brother went into the hospital, he was taken to the emergency room.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>We were told that his body.</p>
<p>I began the dying process.</p>
<p>Now he is a very young man.</p>
<p>And for us to be told that it was really scary.</p>
<p>We were told that his liver had gone into liver failure.</p>
<p>And that if this body did not start to.</p>
<p>To to show any signs of healing in the next 12 to 24 hours.</p>
<p>He was going to go to the number one spot on the emergency liver transplant list.</p>
<p>And the entire SE part of the United States.</p>
<p>The shock does were like Oh my goodness yesterday, he was bebopping around the world.</p>
<p>And now he might die.</p>
<p>So our family stayed there. The entire day and into the night but then I said to the family. I said, please everyone. Go home get a good nights sleep. He was unconscious. I said get a good night sleep. I will stay here, and be with him tonight, just in case he wakes up.</p>
<p>They went home.</p>
<p>And what they didn't know is that I have this technique.</p>
<p>Of holding positive states for a lot of one.</p>
<p>And I am and I decided to do a yasa, which is where you stay up all night long and you. You focus for myself. I decided to focus on these positive states.</p>
<p>So I sat by his bedside and.</p>
<p>Because of the situation, I had.</p>
<p>A lot of feeling inside of me of love towards him so at first I said there and I radiated love towards him. I just sat there and I just.</p>
<p>Focused on the love going out to him. I'm looking at him laying in it bad.</p>
<p>I focused on the love going towards him.</p>
<p>After a period of time.</p>
<p>I wasn't I couldn't feel the love inside my body.</p>
<p>So then I started focusing on wonderful memories that we had had.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>I remembered great times. We had growing up an I would focus on that memory and then the love and the feeling which is radiate out of me towards him.</p>
<p>And I said there for hours and felt so much love and gratitude for him in my life and.</p>
<p>About two 3:00 o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p>The love kind of went away because of the exhaustion and I started to have talk of you know just Oh I'm tired. I want to sleep.</p>
<p>But then by focusing on that talk and then changing that, to love and so instead of going down the road of the negative talk I focused on positive talk.</p>
<p>An I would just sit there and I would just say love and I'd feel the love going out to him. I'd go love. I love you so much. I mean, I would just any loving thought or talk that I could say in my head to radiate towards my brother.</p>
<p>That's what I did.</p>
<p>You know, I I live my life that I try to love People day today. An I try to be there for them and I try to cherish them.</p>
<p>But I've never experienced a love that deep when I am in such a vulnerable state.</p>
<p>And he's in such a vulnerable state that.</p>
<p>To feel that love radiating towards him hour after hour?</p>
<p>It was a great it was a great gift that.</p>
<p>That, he gave to me that night.</p>
<p>For me.</p>
<p>By using the whole positive interstates.</p>
<p>It truly changed.</p>
<p>The way I feel about my brother. I have so much love and compassion in my heart for him.</p>
<p>And I feel like I love him on so much of a deeper level now and.</p>
<p>And I am just so grateful for for him and for the love and for the time that we that we have shared, he he he has had a full recovery and I am so grateful for that.</p>
<p>I know that without that technique. I would have gone to the hospital. I would have suffered I would have heard all the negative stuff that was happening. I would've heard he was going to die for this reason, or that reason or you know, I mean, I would have heard all of that negative stuff and I would have freaked out. I would have been I would have been in a panic state, I would have would not have been able to focus. I would not have been I would have been so consumed with all the negativity of the situation.</p>
<p>Then I then I just would have been in a huge ball of suffering.</p>
<p>Because of these this technique.</p>
<p>It turned a terrable negative situation in my life.</p>
<p>Into a deep clean of love for my brother.</p>
<p>I am forever, grateful for this technique.</p>
