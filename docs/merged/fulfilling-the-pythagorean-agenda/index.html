<p>There was back in the 6th century BC in Greece was Pythagoras.</p>
<p>And Pythagoras had a remarkable notion.</p>
<p>A notion that somehow, the nature of the material world.</p>
<p>And the nature of the inner world of thought emotion, and spirit.</p>
<p>And the nature of number or somehow linked.</p>
<p>And if you could figure that out.</p>
<p>Then you would have a complete.</p>
<p>Model.</p>
<p>For that would cover all the needs of humanity.</p>
<p>One of the problems that were as I look upon it 3 problems.</p>
<p>One is his notion of the nature of number.</p>
<p>Was too limited?</p>
<p>Essentially, it was positive whole integers, the 2nd is that they didn't have the experimental method to explore nature.</p>
<p>That only developed with Galileo Francis Bacon, Newton in his optics for example, and then subsequent researchers scientists.</p>
<p>And then the other things, the other thing Agent Greeks lacked was methods of developing enough concentration power systematically.</p>
<p>To explore the nature of the inner world, so they didn't didn't know how to make experiments to explore the nature of the outer world and they didn't have the technology of high concentration.</p>
<p>That India did have.</p>
<p>That you need in order to explore the inner world and they didn't have an adequate concept of number.</p>
<p>In order to model either 1.</p>
<p>But I think that we now are in a position to fulfill the pythagorean agenda.</p>
<p>Because we now have a notion of number that's broad enough. Both the outer dance and the inner dance can be modeled with our present number system because it has enough contrasts built in.</p>
<p>To explore the different flavors of expansion and contraction. the W has discovered the concentration methods from the East and we have the experimental method for looking at the outside nature.</p>
<p>There's</p>
<p>A teaching in Mahayana Buddhism that all beings have the put down nature.</p>
<p>The Greek word for nature. The thing that pythagoras.</p>
<p>And Western civilization from his time on wanted to study.</p>
<p>The word was physis and that's given us, the word physics for example, physics is the study of the nature of things.</p>
<p>I think that.</p>
<p>The confluence.</p>
<p>Of.</p>
<p>The empirical method.</p>
<p>The.</p>
<p>Focus techniques from the E empirical means experimental method.</p>
<p>And the ability to mathematically model.</p>
<p>The results of experiments on the outside and now in this century will start to model the results of experiments on the inside Mathematic Lee.</p>
<p>Will be able to achieve the pythagorean agenda?</p>
<p>And as a result of that.</p>
<p>It's easy for me to imagine that there will be a.</p>
<p>There could be I don't say this will happen because who knows.</p>
<p>I just say it's not hard for me to imagine.</p>
<p>That the human condition.</p>
<p>In the next century.</p>
<p>Could change rapidly?</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Globally.</p>
<p>And dramatically for the better and.</p>
<p>I think that everyone of us that follows this path.</p>
<p>Has a little roll?</p>
<p>Perhaps.</p>
<p>In what could be?</p>
<p>One of the most important events in all of history.</p>
