Now I seem to remember last time we talked you were.

Talking about a baby, possibly do you have any questions about my mindful doing burn? Absolutely. Yes.

Could could you talk about?

Giving birth in particular, well, you know how to work in field space. You know how to work with uncomfortable touches. You've done it with your my grades. You know how to work with challenging emotions.

Well, that's all that's going to come up right you've already done it.

You know that things tend to break up into flow that will be.

Even more evident in the birthing process probably or what I mean by probably is there's a statistical tendency for anyone. Even someone that hasn't done practices and whatever there's a force in nature that.

Makes that pushes mothers into the experience of flow when they give birth, but they may or may not be able to detect how nature is sort of moving them in that direction. But you it's highly probable that you will be able to detect that given your background, you know they'll be these challenges and you'll apply the procedures that you're familiar with.

In addition to the fact that it's extremely challenging.

You've also got all these forces of nature that are sort of trying to help you out right because women have been doing this for since the beginning, so the body is designed to go into equanimity and flow states during the birthing process as I say due to various.

Circumstances.

In modern civilization People don't know how to detect that natural tendency, so they may not exactly go with it.

But you will you got the challenge level growing?

But then you've got what your body naturally knows your consciousness actually naturally knows to do, which is to drop in the equanimity and flow.

So those are going to race a little bit and they do in anybody.

But because you have a practice.

That gives a huge advantage to the forces of nature that.

Are trying to make it into a good experience? So it's likely that the equanimity and flow will be able to keep well ahead of the rising challenge level likely OK the contractions start at first their mild and their spaced.

And then they get more intense and closer together.

You understand what I'm saying and that sort of builds to a point where they are extremely intense and very close together nature is trying to create a rhythm.

And get you into a rhythm.

And it starts out very gentle.

An mild and without too much challenge level. If you can get In Sync with that rhythm from the get go by the time it reaches full blown intensity, you'll have become.

The cosmic world space itself, giving birth there's a peak and there's a Valley. There's a peak and there's a valid pin where the change is subtle takes a lot of work to dissolve.

But pain that comes in well defined peaks and valleys much easier to deal with.

Because they couldn't get into a rhythm with it.

And pain that starts out hardly pain at all, and with long.

Intervals.

But then it's going to eventually get to maximum possible. I've been told it reaches the maximum the nervous system can produce.

Yet.

Women do this OK, so that means that the potential for transcendence for permanent transformation of consciousness is just incredible.

But you see how nature is trying to make it easy on you.

It's like it's mild in space.

So you get into this rhythm with it.

And there are various ways that you can get into the rhythm, which I'll describe in specific and then when you finally sort of reached the periods of intensity. There's a high probability that you'll be in an ecstatic state.

So.

What happens when a discomfort intensifies well?

It may spread when a touch.

Expands.

There is a tendency for the mind.

To contract.

And to turn off.

Except if the mind freaks out if the mind freaks out, then as the pain expands the mental reaction expands if you sort of look at what the natural tendency? Is it simultaneous expansion contraction. The body physical sensations that touch expands and there's a natural tendency for the image and talk to sort of go into blank and quiet at that time.

OK, that's a tendency now if you can notice that tendency then each time there's a peak.

So you let the pain expand.

And you simultaneously let the mind contract.

OK.

And so that peak drives you into blank and quiet in mind space.

And then your butt big sensation expanded.

But this is no mind or little mind is little sense of self.

It's OK, you'll be like literally becoming flow. If you can start that rhythm off fairly quickly.

By the time things are getting intense and coming fast and furious each expansion of sensation like.

The body spends more, but the mind contracts into rest more so each spike of contraction drives the mind into a restful state.

Now.

There are also valleys in between the peaks what's the natural thing during the Valley is to physically relax the body?

OK, that's not the pressures off when the Valley comes you go into relaxation, which is totally natural because the pains not there right. So then you, relax and then when the peak comes you let the peak. Dr you into blank and quiet and then during the value go deeper into relax OK and then the peak your in flight quiet. There is a tendency to when touch expands sometimes emotion react to it, but sometimes feel gets turned off too.

OK and that could be a natural tendency feel arising by way of reaction might fear that can happen, but you can also see that it will sometimes turn off field and produce emotional piece is just like only so much real estate in the body.

And if touch is big enough. There's no room for feel anymore. No room for emotion in the body. The cycle is touch expands feel image talk self.

Thought emotion self contracts at the same time, OK, so you're aware of peaceful and quiet.

At the peak and then there were physical relaxation in the Valley. Then you get into a rhythm with it and the body is.

Is now being controlled by that rhythm?

At the peak.

The.

Feeling thinking self.

Is just gone it's just in peace by quiet?

And at the Valley. It's easy to physically relax about the cycle takes you into a state of relaxation peaceful and quiet. You may have trouble focusing your eyes and ears at some point like you're going to pass out and your eyes start to swim.

That creates might and silence.

So the whole thing is just driving it into restful states.

And then the restful states flow and then your expansion and contraction and the universe is expansion and contraction become a single expansion and contraction and.

God.

Gives birth to the baby through you so to speak and you experience that directly.

Beautiful yeah, yeah that's that's how I coach women through the birthing process.

Wow.

Wow.

Or one of the strategies if that doesn't work better other strategies about.

The flow of having a baby wow. All that's beautiful.
