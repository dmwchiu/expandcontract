<p>Usually between one of the techniques. I space out often that'll happen.</p>
<p>And I'm not in a good place to figure out what to do next with.</p>
<p>It during that space out period, but I realized I spaced out So what I've been doing is picking something having something already set in mind that if I put great that's a clever strategy but also you know, my standard thing as soon as soon as you get the hint that you're spacing out if possible. Watt, what do you do? I'll give you the I'll give you the the the I hit SL spoken labels it's not so matter. A bunch of matter of I'm spaced out all I gotta find a new technique.</p>
<p>It's I'm spaced out.</p>
<p>I gotta use my options, with this technique continue on this, but they know that and I often comes to mind.</p>
<p>And I don't want you.</p>
<p>I wish I felt stronger to work with that, or so usually I'll just go back to that beginning text. So let me put a positive spin on I don't want.</p>
<p>That's my job basically is to show that actually everything is going to go out.</p>
<p>All the I don't want to.</p>
<p>Why is why is what's positive about the I just don't want to?</p>
<p>System thing OK.</p>
<p>Well, you're spacing out right. It means that the concentration isn't good. It means that the attention is being scattered now.</p>
<p>And we want to gradually train ourselves, so that our attention isn't scattered.</p>
<p>But what's difficult is?</p>
<p>That what scattering attention is not tangible there's an intangible force that is scattering your attention.</p>
<p>And you're at the mercy of it as long as it's intangible.</p>
<p>Now here's the here's why the I just don't want to use spoken labels.</p>
<p>Is a window of opportunity because if you do speak the labels?</p>
<p>You're gonna not feel good.</p>
<p>In subjective space, the Speaking of the labels is going to be uncomfortable.</p>
<p>That's why you don't want to do it.</p>
<p>And forcing yourself to do it will make you uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Why is that good because the invisible forces that were controlling you?</p>
<p>Now have come up.</p>
<p>As tangible sensations in the body that are penetratable.</p>
<p>OK and so you go to focus in or a focus on feel feel in.</p>
<p>And you force yourself to do the spoken labels that you apply it to.</p>
<p>How uncomfortable you are speaking the labels and that then allows you to work through those those forces in the tangible way so that I wasn't being facetious or cavalier when when I said that actually it is actually window of opportunity to work through the driving forces of scattered nahs so if you're willing to do it, you're going to really develop concentration power effectively.</p>
<p>If you're not willing to do it. It's Penny Wise and pound foolish. You you feel a little better during the set, which are not really deeply training, the skills.</p>
<p>So that's my little motivational should be over.</p>
<p>SL spoken labels yes.</p>
<p>This morning I spent.</p>
<p>1st and 2nd Sith I was really tired from.</p>
<p>And so I use labels that were mouse, yeah, Soto Voci anyway. To do is spoken labels and it's completely affected. It was really good. You whispered the words you use a book. You just move your lips and you don't have any place where you describe the 3 different ways of labeling and record differently.</p>
<p>That's in the next edition. That's that is the biggest Lakunle in there, which I realized my horror what's wrong with this picture, the central technique is not fully described?</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>There is The Hobbit noted label on the Internet OK, but we forgot to put it into the manual OK. So yeah, it's like the thousand pound elephant in the room, so poignantly aware of that.</p>
<p>Thank you resistance.</p>
<p>Do you stop on a dime? I I'm not sure I understood what you're doing you're stopping on a dime and that that character? What happens is yes, I I went through it, fast, so thanks for asking.</p>
<p>So we sometimes are aware of just that there are like in forces driving us in our behaviors driving us to think driving us to talk. Dragon us to move an it's like force just a force that's making me do it.</p>
<p>And it's intangible in the sense that I can't. Locate it in time and space are you many quality to it other than say it's a force.</p>
<p>How long I'm saying?</p>
<p>This is nothing mysterious so far right OK so.</p>
<p>How can we make these invisible intractable forces?</p>
<p>Tangible and tractable so that we can actually penetrate them and work them through while they have to come up to percolate up to tangibility the way they percolate up to Tange abilities through abstinence.</p>
<p>OK, if you abstain from X then what's been driving you to do X is going to come to the surface.</p>
<p>It's going to come to the surface as image talk, emotional body sometimes physical body too.</p>
<p>This is true for any addiction recovery situation whether it's recovery from a substance or recovery from compulsive thinking.</p>
<p>Or recovery from.</p>
<p>Life the ultimate in covering program break the addiction to life and death.</p>
<p>Call separation.</p>
<p>But same is true OK, though the same principle holes you have to abstain.</p>
<p>In order for what's been driving it to come up and be tangible as image talk body OK.</p>
<p>So when that happens now you can apply a technique so the situation that Pam was describing is well, I space out.</p>
<p>And that's ahead and space out and I know that I should go to the spoken labels. But I don't want to do it, so that's another happen, not wanting to do the spoken labels So what I said, is well let me put a positive spin on that situation.</p>
<p>If you do it if you force yourself if you abstain from not life. Speaking the labels OK, so in this case. It's a do the behavior thing if you do that behavior. You're going to feel uncomfortable what we don't want to feel uncomfortable in general, but actually in this case, we do because whatever comes up in Stockton. Emotional body of I hate this, or band here bank here back here that represents the forces that were driving those behaviors.</p>
<p>But now those forces are not invisible forces their tangible sensations. Their tangible visual auditory of somatic experience is what? What is tangible can be quantized and can be experienced completely can be penetrated therefore? What is tangent? What is all well? What is trackable OK? When is tangible is travel meaning that we can apply?</p>
<p>A mindfulness technique to things are intangible that they're not trackable OK, so there's little we can do other than white knuckle.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>What is what is tangible is track of?</p>
<p>Maybe you can noted.</p>
<p>What is trackable is is tractable?</p>
<p>Means you could get a handle on.</p>
<p>So that's the mechanism that I was describing with regards to why.</p>
<p>You what's gonna happen if you force yourself to speak the labels and why that's a good thing kinda.</p>
<p>Not the same is stopping at a time it's very related 'cause when you stop on a dime in daily life.</p>
<p>Then.</p>
<p>The juices that have been stirred up by life come up with a vengeance very quick.</p>
<p>If you can be Johnny on the spot with it, you can actually meditate retroactively.</p>
<p>Hum.</p>
<p>Like you say, well, I thought that's against the rules, you can do. Let's say that you're bopping around in the world and you just like a whirling Dervish near it going here going there. No techniques know aware.</p>
<p>And I'm going to.</p>
<p>Really face what's been stirred up.</p>
<p>In that 10 minutes if you really bring your A game.</p>
<p>You can retroactively process all those hours of unconscious phonetic nahs.</p>
<p>And that's the rhythm of the Cente.</p>
<p>Unlike a vipasana train.</p>
<p>They zende is run around like crazy stop on the run around like crazy stop and I leased Rinzai. Zen Soto Zen. Not so much. But Rinzai Zen, absolutely run around like crazy stop on the dog run around like crazy stuff on the dock all day now that's either going to make you just phonetic as hell or are you going to learn what I just said, which is like when you're running around like crazy.</p>
<p>And then you stop on a dime you can process all that crazy, very, very quickly.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>So it goes so yes, it's related it sounds like a version of this well asceticism is.</p>
<p>A generic term so.</p>
<p>It.</p>
<p>There are many facets to asceticism that could be one of them yes.</p>
<p>Well, what I was running my restaurants. I would every hour go out and sit on the bench in front of the restaurant. The bus stop bench for 5 minutes and I found the great advantage of that stopping like that is that then at the end of the day. You haven't built up a whole lot of sense or as you.</p>
<p>Periodically let government so that your much calmer at the end of the day that was my pepper right? That's a great specific example.</p>
