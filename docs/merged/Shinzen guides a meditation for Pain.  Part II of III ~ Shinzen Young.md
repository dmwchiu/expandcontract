No.

Slow down the label just slightly to give yourself more time to sort of soak your awareness into that.

Secondary sensation.

And if there's no secondary sensation of all the secondaires disappear, you can use the label nowhere.

But if you're drawn to say your whole body like it seems to spread through your whole body and you're aware of that, then you can use the label whole body.

Thumbs.

Or head.

What was happening during the silence there?

Were you focusing in the same location?

Felt like whole body but it wasn't enough to say it. I just suddenly the whole body. Subtle is significant definitely if there's a hint of whole body say whole body.

And just open up the whole body to it.

So if guessing and groping is OK by the way it's perfectly OK to make a gas.

Any questions, so far, it's a whole body. Now there's a lot of whole body. Yeah, OK good. It may be always whole body that's actually it does it seem like it wants to do that? When you say whole body zoom out and cover the spread you know how.

If you

If you have a local pressure and then you let it spread out that will relieve the pressure if you let those secondary sensations spread over your whole body. You may find that that dissipates some of the pressure from the local intensity after enough time that's the purpose for opening up to the possibility that it spreads over the whole body, so that's X once again that's excellent spatial.

Resolution by resolution I mean ability to be clear about what you're detecting so if it seems to be a whole body and it's over and over again whole body just zoom your attention out cover the whole body and just let the sensation ripple and radiate out into space in all 6 directions out from your body does that instruction makes sense excellent so now. I'd like you to continue using the spoken labels once again, I'll just be doing my own.

Practice why you do that.

Hips.

Forearm.

Ankles.

Whole body.

That's perfect.

By that I mean, the tone of voice the pacing and the wording are all perfect.

Once you establish this awareness.

The rest is just a matter of time.

The tone of voice indicates that you have a quality that we call equanimity.

The pacing of the labels guarantees that you're highly concentrated.

And the wording of the labels guarantees that you're bringing sensory clarity to the experience in this case, the sensory clarity.

Is the precision with regards to the location of the secondary spread sensations?

Does that make sense? How what you're doing develops those 3 qualities?

Once you have a momentum of those qualities, then it's just a numbers game, you are setting the stage for nature too.

Break up the suffering.

From this experience, it could happen in 5 minutes or it could take 5 months, depending on the depth of the challenge. But you I can tell by the way that you're labeling that you have a momentum of concentration clarity and equanimity. Once you establish that momentum. Then the rest is just keeping it up and letting time pass does that make sense excellent now I'd like.

You could continue to do that, once again, I'm just going to do my own practice for a few minutes and we're going to give nature a chance give some time for it.

Any questions about what we've done so far makes perfect sense excellent.

Hang with that for a minute and then I'll touch base with you again in a couple minutes.



Eyes.

You can label a little bit more quickly just a bit more.

That will help with concentration a little bit.

You can repeat the same label again.

Ankles.

The.

Whole body.
