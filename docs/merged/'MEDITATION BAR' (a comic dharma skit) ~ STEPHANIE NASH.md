About you, but after a good retreat. There's nothing. I like better than to head down to my local meditation barn throwback a few techniques.

Maybe even take home a good procedure too.

Yeah, there's a lot of good places around here purification pub hochland hatch.

Epoche Attica Nietzsche Annex and the axis of ego, which is too noisy for my tastes just doesn't have a good feel to it.

Oh, and there's the clarification cafe. They got ***** for eating meditation. There, a mechanical hand comes down, and stops your arm right as you lift the food than a voice comes on saying Meditate on that.

Yeah, they got therapists in the next room from when it doesn't workout.

My favorite place is the pass and a vortex used to be called's than it is when it was owned by this guiding Roshi But.

He had a lot of activity and moved on to another level of consciousness.

The for passing a vortex is situated in a way that you can see right through it.

Over the door is a color monitor running dos and black and white and something in Sanskrit or pali. Or maybe it's Chinese. I'm told. It translates apart site through site and insight all fit fits welcome.

Chill greets me at the door, she runs the place.

A Great Dane with a solid gold heart and smiled a match she says.

Is that a guru in your pocket or are you just happy to be here?

I smile and head over the bar for a clarity cocktail. I got some fuzzy aspects. I could use a good buzz.

The Bliss bunnies are circulating and free floating throughout the room, giving out labels.

Sometimes they take you upstairs and show you a rising and falling as usually some flow there, too.



There is my friend well it's got a horse named Charlie Yeah. Wells alot like Charlie Horse, but he'll never see it.

Yeah.

I see Shenzi over his usual booth. He owns the place you can tell his booth by the charts and graphs.

Yeah, he's a geek and Indesign mathematics, but don't let the glasses fool you. He may be able to say somebody in a dozen languages, but he can get your son skates flowing better than nasal spray.

He reportedly has a bank account with the big guy with more zeros than you want to know about.

Upstairs, there's also a Goenka Parlor. They do piercings. They start with the nose and her sometimes known to Pierce through the whole body fear into that kind of thing.

Back when Roshi own the place it was a Zen arcade allowed a parlor games learning their clap with one hand, making faces like before you were born that kind of thing. There was a big flower in the corner and if you could get inside of it and get out without anybody seeing you. You could get a ride on the complete experience which is no ordinary ride supposedly. It is the best thing that ever happens to you.

Except you can't remember a thing.



Yeah, the main Zen thing around here, these days is the merge with us conference call and you can practice the program at home, yeah.

I guess you can now merge it local or long distance race, but Information is always free.

That noise some D construction happening up on the 3rd floor. The place isn't pieces. But I hear they got rid of a lot of unnecessary crap that was gumming up the works.

Here, the view is going to be a lot better now.

Oh.

It's almost time for the last show is a good act a singer with a dress so tight. All you can see is expansion and contraction.

Some undulation lots of good body sensations.

Her name is Melissa Maná.

Yeah, she's a bit self absorbed but she sings a good song.

Sometimes the show was solid sometimes restful, but it always flows and before you know it. It is over gone could put I chill with the solid hang with the restful and go with the flow and when it's over nothing Nada 0.

But that's how it goes.

I'm going back to the bar for a second clarity cocktail before the show. I want to get a good seat.



It's been nice chatting with you.

Or have I been some.

Internal talk and mental image taking you away from being here now.

The only way for you to know for sure, is to wake up.

Good luck with that.
