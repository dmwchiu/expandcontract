A question about just North Carolina.

Um.

I've been doing at practice a lot for last few days.

And.

The first time through.

Fulfilling and rewarding.

Nursing management and

I guess starting yesterday and the more so this morning.

More and more attracted to.

Vashon for the intervals are sure I'm sure sure.

Are you meaning intervals between the vanishings that shorter?

Hearing or seeing or feeling.

Where are you getting closer to?

Um.

A vibration well this started yesterday where I might be hearing interval certain Apple in a bird chirping.

Where it began with?

I comentale node gone.

And then something so fast. Where can barely match?

Alt mentally.

I'm aware of Ghana's be cause I can hear the vibration.

Tripping.

But I don't have the sensory clarity to note.

Well, that's your sensory clarity that you're aware that there's this continuous Godless and then every once in awhile you get.

More noticeable macro Ganz OK that will punctuate the continuous micro gone so that is your sensory clarity is to be detecting that In addition to the Macro Ganz occasionally.

And that's something that I referred to in the manual eyes figure ground reversal. What's beginning to happen is gone is less something you're observing?

And more something that's always, there and it's The Observer that's coming and going.

That's a That's a That's a huge shift in ones practice from that's basically the shift from.

Observing the self to manifesting the self.

Those next question was service in cities because did before they bring I was.

Movie about a pound a other clothes in the room or in my ear, but basically a blogger.com.

In which I could.

Happy down here now there's only know Dan felt more like.

Presence.

Then.

Yeah, yeah that's right right? That's exact that's the figure ground reversal. That referred to in the manual as one of the possible things that can happen as you're doing it. Basically, the intervals of something nahs between vanishings. They get shorter and in between. There's less and less something that's until.

If there's anything in between the Ganz it's just both.

There's in outflow gone in our fault gone in out full gone and the the cleft is as it's like.

You know the black hole. It polarizes but it just then re collapses to the black hole and doesn't decide to do a Big Bang and make a universe.
