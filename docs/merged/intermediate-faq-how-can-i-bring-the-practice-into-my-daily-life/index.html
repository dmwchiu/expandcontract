<p>And the quick answer to that is if you want to achieve that laudable goal like any other project. You have to take measures, it's a combination of.</p>
<p>Yes, doing enough formal practice retreat and self practice, so that there's a carryover into life. That's part of it, but then there are specific things that a person can do to assure that the practice is going to influence their day-to-day ordinary life. One of the things that you can do is you can take short moments in the day stop on a dime and begin.</p>
<p>A mindfulness practice for 30 seconds here or 3 minutes, there when right on the fly. When nothing too demanding is happening. I call that practice in life, you can just start site.</p>
<p>Site.</p>
<p>Feel.</p>
<p>Talk.</p>
<p>Image I just start like that.</p>
<p>The process of noting while one giving the stock OK, so doing that peppering your day with that and then the other thing is creating a challenge sequence where you take a technique and you do it seated ice close seated eyes open standing.</p>
<p>Slow movement are slow movement in an impactful environments, then do the technique while doing a simple test to the technique while doing more demanding tasks. You create challenge sequences in your gradually work your way up until you can maintain the technique in very, very complicated. Circumstances so combination of peppering the day at least a half dozen times every day for just.</p>
<p>Even if just for a few seconds you implement the practice on the fly that plus creating challenge sequences, which are analogous to adding more and more weights or doing more and more reps with in weight training. So you make sort of gradually pick up heavier and heavier weights. You train yourself to maintain the techniques. You use in more more complicated situations gradually so the challenge sequence?</p>
<p>Plus, the sort of surgical strikes during the day.</p>
<p>Plus enough momentum from formal practice those 3 taken together will allow for the practice to begin to.</p>
<p>Inundate your entire life so there's a figure ground reversal at first.</p>
<p>Meditation is one of the things you do in life. Eventually, you have to reach the point where life is something that takes place inside meditation.</p>
