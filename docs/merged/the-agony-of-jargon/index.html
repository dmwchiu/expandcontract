<p>Because different teachers use different language Ng.</p>
<p>For identical phenomenon.</p>
<p>And different teachers use identical words for entirely different from home.</p>
<p>And there's just no way around that it just is because everybody sort of develops their own.</p>
<p>So it is hugely confusing to.</p>
<p>And I'd really feel sorry for anyone that hasn't done 30 or 40 years of practice.</p>
<p>Because it takes 30 or 40 years to see when 2 People are using the same words.</p>
<p>For something completely different than when they're using very different words for something completely. The same just takes a long time typically to develop that kind of sent you know that clarity now.</p>
<p>I don't think this situation is going to go on for many more. Decades certainly not for more than a century or 2 because we're now dialoguing. The teachers dialogue. They didn't in the old days. Everybody had their only futile domain.</p>
<p>Lords of the Castle and they didn't do open peer to peer.</p>
<p>Dialoguing in public or say if anything happened in public. It was just a debate where they were trying to trance. The other guy and even the Buddha use. They look at the Buddhist Literature. It's just the Buddha, defeating one person after another after another with his paradigm that's what it is that's what the Pali Canon is about.</p>
<p>It's not him, talking to other People peer to peer.</p>
<p>OK, so.</p>
<p>But now things are different.</p>
<p>Now, now there's a different spirit, the spirit of science, the spirit of.</p>
<p>Collegial cooperation.</p>
<p>And that will probably gain momentum in the next 100 years or so.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Probably we won't have this agony of jargon and seemingly conflicting Maps and claim.</p>
<p>But right now here at the awkward intermediate period of history.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Let me just try to make it as simple as possible.</p>
<p>If Daniel or Kenneth says AP read that as both gone.</p>
<p>Oh **** then end of story.</p>
<p>OK, we just.</p>
<p>For whatever reasons have this different language in things so that may help clarify alone.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>So that deep experience of space spreading and collapsing as soon as it's arising OK that's your AP.</p>
<p>Experiences.</p>
<p>And one way to that means arising passing in the jargon of some teachers.</p>
<p>It corresponds to dia dia VIA in Poly and it is mentioned definitely mentioned in the pali camp.</p>
<p>And probably in a sense pretty similar to what those contemporary teachers.</p>
<p>One way to measure you know, there's lots of ways to measure progress see. Now in.</p>
<p>In early Buddhism, they measured progress in terms of.</p>
<p>Working through craving aversion and unconsciousness.</p>
<p>That's the different you know.</p>
<p>Stream Enterer once returner non returner are hot and so forth that's that's one metric there's a.</p>
<p>Alternate metric called the 10 oxherding pictures that gives you a picture of about 50 years of practice.</p>
<p>From the first picture to though.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>7th picture 700, yeah right.</p>
<p>It's hard to see that those 2 Maps correspond exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>Don't seem to have anything in common.</p>
<p>Another way to measure progress is.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>For how long through what kind of intensity.</p>
<p>Can you have an experience of both comp or?</p>
<p>Rising passing.</p>
<p>That's another way to measure progress.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I don't know if that's of any help.</p>
