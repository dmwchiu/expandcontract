<p>Yeah, I can see a person inside that Camera that I'm talking to, I mean in some weird way not.</p>
<p>Hallucinate ING way well actually it's a Homunculus, Oh, it's me reflected.</p>
<p>I said that all the time we've been shooting this, but I cover on the lens is that a problem.</p>
<p>I guess this is the metaphor or.</p>
<p>I guess this is the metaphor right now, I guess.</p>
<p>We're filming this.</p>
<p>In Niagara Falls, Canada.</p>
<p>So I have with me the actual icon itself.</p>
<p>Of.</p>
<p>Canada it's also icon for where I live Vermont. I think we're just about as good as this at this as you Canucks are.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Now here's the metaphor.</p>
<p>There is a general pattern of.</p>
<p>That happens on the spiritual path.</p>
<p>Filming.</p>

<p>This is pure product **** **** coming out of the dude.</p>
<p>And let's face it on these retreats. We get a little down. That's good OK actually that's good because that's a sign that you're dropping deep.</p>
<p>How's that?</p>
<p>What are your recommendations for surmounting the 5:00 hindrances in your mindfulness train?</p>
<p>You have to remind me what the 5:00 hindrances are.</p>
<p>Sloth and torpor, yeah that's exactly why you have to remind me.</p>
<p>The **** does that mean?</p>
<p>I just couldn't resist that one.</p>
<p>Join me on the dark.</p>
<p>Oh wait wait wait now this is the true cross is here. And here's Tim Horton's hockey stick, which one do you worship?</p>
<p>Just you around there.</p>
<p>Already twisted enough, I think that was we were even a little further twisted than that don't you think I think is really yeah, no no. We know that it was a little further twisted that.</p>
<p>I don't remember being so twisted, yeah, I do.</p>
<p>How do I know if it's better for me to focus on developing concentration 1st and then applying that concentration to investigation or whether I should go with driver plus not approach.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Does formal meditation ever end?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>OK, I'd like to read a quote you and I'd like to respond.</p>
<p>Another time when someone kept pushing shun ru, Suzuki to talk about enlightenment, he replied.</p>
<p>What do you want to know for you may not like it?</p>
