<p>Where is positive within both golf?</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Haha it's not that sort of the whole point, no positive no negative. This is as close as you get to the nonhuman as as you can get. However, the great parents, so intrinsically there is no love. There is no hate there.</p>
<p>Intrinsically, but still that's hitting a human being OK. We're still in human being and when we get hit by the impersonal.</p>
<p>That tends to trigger a sense of deep human love, but it's not intrinsic to the impersonal. It's intrinsic to the fact that you're still a human being and touching that.</p>
<p>All which is</p>
<p>You know as as his sets strikes down God and the devil simultaneously, OK, so you would think well.</p>
<p>That's a little bit more like the devil, then God, but when when a human because it's like you know.</p>
<p>Where is ethics wears long but when that's the central mystery when when the human touch is the non human the human is nurtured and improved by way of rehashing so that would be touching the non even source is.</p>
<p>When you come back the ripples of love are there that's pretty much it.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>So then the authentic person is in the source, but not in the ripples of love.</p>
<p>Well be authentic currently authentic person.</p>
<p>Is the puppeteer?</p>
<p>The the</p>
<p>The puppet that that invisible hand is inserted into.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Very much we'll be manifesting now love and compassion in the world.</p>
<p>So it's the power source.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>You can think of it on an analogy of broadcasting so there's there's the wattage of the station power that joules per second. That's rate at which enerji is going out.</p>
<p>However, that the wattage is not the only parameter of radio or TV station.</p>
<p>There there's a modulation that goes on. On that wattage that carries a message. It could be music. It could be OK and it could modulate either amplitude or frequency, but the point. Is there's a message that's writing on that Enerji Wave. It's modulated or encoded.</p>
<p>Home but it's not the energycap way of itself, the energy wave is just pure enerji, but but so that's inside the puppet is that energy wave but the surface of the puppet.</p>
<p>Should be?</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Should be unapproachable admirable?</p>
<p>Helpful human being.</p>
<p>That that's what I call classical alignment or Class C in like as opposed to crazy wisdom other things that People do where?</p>
<p>They're not the surface is not necessarily unapproachable admirable helpful an ordinary human being.</p>
<p>So that's how I look at it anyway, so if somebody is in touch with the source and also in touch with being.</p>
<p>Beneficial to other Indians there going source.</p>
<p>Here socio sorcery sorcery or something like that, Well, you can use different metaphors.</p>
<p>You could use an alternating metaphor, but I didn't I sort of like the spatial metaphor of.</p>
<p>There's space inside you that's</p>
<p>All that sort of animating you anima that like this different possible metaphors.</p>
<p>So yeah, so one way to think about it.</p>
