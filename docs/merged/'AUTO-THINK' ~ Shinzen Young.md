There's also a technique that I call auto think which is a way of training a person too.

Uh.

Think without thinking now you might say well, how in the world do you train someone into that? How do you train them use too?

Talk to you how do you train intuition and creativity well?

It's actually fairly.

Involved procedure but I can give you just a brief description. It starts with something that anyone can do you track mental activity in terms of 4 possibilities?

See here see here.

Ann.

Rest so see means you're having a mental image here mids are having mental talk see here means.

You're having mental image of mental talk at the same time, and rest means that the system has not active your mental screen is blank in your head is quiet at the same time.

Ah, or in the most extreme case, it means that both image space and talk space that vanished mind spaces collapse to a dimensionless point. But even if that doesn't happen. You can still be aware of breast or absence of activity.

Which I described as the mental screen is blank in the head is quiet so that's a relative rest and you could also have absolute rest in your mind. Otherwise, your mind is active and that can only happen in one of three ways image talk or both at the same time, so you track that and then you get some momentum and then you can move to a more challenging procedure, which is to cover mind space.

Play some attention in image space, some attention in Talkspace, Mindspace sort of has a front and a back images 10. It's a little more complex in this, but they tend to center sort of in front.

That's all talk tends to be in the head of the year. So just like the body has a front and a pack your mind roughly speaking has anterior and posterior.

Space and so you cover mind space and you just sort of Freud may be called it evenly hovering. There is that a phrase that he used so but he was talking about the outside. We're talking about evenly hovering on the inside so you cover mind space and that's actually.

Not as easy for most people's noting the mind states meeting tracking image talk both or not. But if you're able to cover mine space that could be very useful and then certain window of opportunity might present itself.

There might be a global une fixated state either. It's all rest. All the time or it's active but it's just a subtle vibration of activity or there are surface thoughts. But they immediately go away, so you never carried away. That's a global une fixated state now.

If you maintain a global une fixated state.

Um.

It may evolve into a situation where you're actually thinking again.

But the thoughts are just self organizing there just happening on their own and their creative and their insightful and now you're into a state of auto think you actually trained yourself to do that now that's a window of opportunity. If that opens you use it. But if it doesn't then you have difficulty covering the mind space then?

Finally we just go back to noting the mind states so it's kind of algorithm that loops and branches and then with time will tend to induce in a person the ability to think without thinking or to have thoughts without a thought thinker that sort of self organized and Carrion Enerji of creativity and or insight.
