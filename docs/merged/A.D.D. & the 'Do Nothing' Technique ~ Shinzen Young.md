I would say in theory.

Yes, it is OK.

And yes, you can do just it for the rest of your life.

However, I would.

Put a little addendum on to that.

You want to make sure that your

Doing it in an optimal way.

And the way to make sure your doing it in an optimal way is at least occasionally touch base with someone who is competent in guiding you with that technique In other words, as far as just using that technique. Hey that's a classic path that will take you all the way to classic enlightenment. I mean, all around the world. The what I call the do nothing approach has been discovered and rediscovered and therefore it's known by various names.



Dog chain Rippa Gomez, the path of non meditation. Those are some of the Tibetan names.

Some interpretations of Zen just sitting shikantaza are that papaji calls it call off the search. Krishnamurti called it choiceless awareness. So yeah, it's a powerful form of practice but.

I think you run a real danger if you try to practice. It just on your own, without occasionally having input from someone who is competent to guide your progress with that technique.

So if you have a DD and you find that what I call the do nothing approach works for you and it's the only one that works for you, certainly that in theory, is sufficient go for it. But try to get some input from someone familiar with that.

Once or twice a year at least so that you know that you're on Coors also, if it works.

You.

A sign of that would be that somewhere down the line. You're a DD will have improved to the point where you can implement other more systematic organized techniques.
