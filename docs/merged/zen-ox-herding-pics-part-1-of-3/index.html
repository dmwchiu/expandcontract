<p>Sometimes calls itself.</p>
<p>The.</p>
<p>The School of.</p>
<p>Consciousness In other words, it teaches the nature of consciousness.</p>
<p>There is a</p>
<p>Famous set of.</p>
<p>Drawings.</p>
<p>That show one paradigm or one possible model for the path of coming.</p>
<p>To understand the nature of your consciousness.</p>
<p>And it's called the 10 Oxherding Pictures surely out in Mandarin pronunciations, you use in the sino Japanese?</p>
<p>Neo means an ox.</p>
<p>And the ox symbolizes.</p>
<p>The nature of consciousness.</p>
<p>So they call it the Shinyo OK, the ox of consciousness, the consciousness symbolized by the ox.</p>
<p>But to understand consciousness.</p>
<p>In other words, experience our senses.</p>
<p>Is also enlightenment so the 10 oxherding pictures can be interpreted in 2 different ways. One is they show you stages on the path to enlightenment.</p>
<p>The other is they show you the process of.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Understanding or truly grasping, Watt consciousness is but of course, those are exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>I would like to go through them.</p>
<p>I don't know if you can all see this, but this is the first picture.</p>
<p>And this is called searching for the ox.</p>
<p>Notice that there is no ox to be found.</p>
<p>The Chinese verse that goes with this says the Oxherding Boy is completely lossed.</p>
<p>There's no trace of the ox. There's only the cicadas chirping do you understand who the oxherding boy? Is and what the cicadas chirping?</p>
<p>This is the situation of most People on this planet at this time, Unfortunately.</p>
<p>They know they want something.</p>
<p>But what they think they want.</p>
<p>Is not what they really want there's everyone search it OK like that song goes everybody's looking for something?</p>
<p>But what People think they want.</p>
<p>Is?</p>
<p>Happiness depended on conditions, but what they really want is happiness Indypendent of conditions.</p>
<p>Symbolized by</p>
<p>In the Enlightenment talks or</p>
<p>The consciousness the nature of consciousness ox, but there's no ox at all, not even any trace of the ox.</p>
<p>He's just wandering around searching for something.</p>
<p>Looking for something.</p>
<p>And just hearing the?</p>
<p>The twittering.</p>
<p>Of the cicadas.</p>
<p>Which is Unfortunately the situation for most People?</p>
<p>Some People though.</p>
<p>In their wanderings.</p>
<p>Get fortunate.</p>
<p>They see the tracks of something.</p>
<p>They haven't seen.</p>
<p>The nature of consciousness, they haven't seen the ox.</p>
<p>They haven't experienced enlightenment.</p>
<p>But something gives them an indication that.</p>
<p>There is this possibility.</p>
<p>Maybe they heard a Dharma talk.</p>
<p>Maybe they had some experience when they were little that they never forgot.</p>
<p>Or when they were grown up.</p>
<p>Maybe they had a friend that came to a retreat.</p>
<p>Etc etc.</p>
<p>They get some indication.</p>
<p>That there's</p>
<p>Another possibility.</p>
<p>Beyond the</p>
<p>Trenchant fulfillment of the twittering world.</p>
<p>So this is called seeing the footprints.</p>
<p>Everyone of you has seen the footprints.</p>
<p>Or you wouldn't be here.</p>
<p>You might guess what the next step is.</p>
<p>He sees the tail on the ox, the tush.</p>
<p>And a few hairs of the tail.</p>
<p>Hasn't really seen the whole ox yet?</p>
<p>But can you see, there's the tush and the tail and it's like Oh my God, it really exists.</p>
<p>I haven't seen it all but I have seen a little piece of it.</p>
<p>Most of you are at least in this category.</p>
<p>You've gone beyond. Just seeing the footprints OK, you've actually gotten a little visage of who you really are.</p>
<p>Or you wouldn't have survived 2 weeks.</p>
<p>In silence.</p>
<p>So you seen the ox.</p>
<p>But that's not.</p>
<p>The same at all catching the ox.</p>
<p>You see, he's got he's got the whole locks.</p>
<p>And he's got a hold of it.</p>
<p>Now we could.</p>
<p>Say that this would be.</p>
<p>Perhaps ones first glimpse of no self.</p>
<p>Stream entry or kensho type experience.</p>
<p>You've actually seen the whole locks.</p>
<p>The nature of consciousness, which is.</p>
<p>No thingness.</p>
<p>And you got a handle on it.</p>
<p>But it's still running wild.</p>
<p>But at least you've captured the ox.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>And it's in your Ken.</p>
<p>You can see it anytime you want.</p>
<p>But that's a far cry.</p>
<p>From.</p>
