<p>Sort of divided things up this way.</p>
<p>Said This is what we tend to identify with.</p>
<p>Physical body.</p>
<p>Pleasant versus unpleasant.</p>
<p>Thoughts.</p>
<p>Habit forces and consciousness itself.</p>
<p>But if you divide it up and then you subdivide you can take the physicality of your body and they didn't have modern chemistry. They didn't have the periodic table of the elements what they had was.</p>
<p>Before classical elements or water air and fire they would.</p>
<p>Break the experience of body into those elements.</p>
<p>That was a subdivided.</p>
<p>So if you divide it all up. Then you'll see. It's just this stuff and there's not a thing called a self here.</p>
<p>My modern reworking of that is the focus in.</p>
<p>Take I take the what I would consider to be the core sense of self.</p>
<p>Which is feel which is sort of related to the beta them?</p>
<p>And the image talk, which are definitely related to the Sun Janelle.</p>
<p>But it is possible to have a broader definition of self its body mind self I find that.</p>
<p>Through feel image talk you can. Yeah, you can get a sense of the unconscious forces so anyway.</p>
<p>Same idea.</p>
<p>But it's a little different because feel image talk are all three of them are sensory events.</p>
<p>That can be monitored in time.</p>
<p>And so by I find that if you can separate them out.</p>
<p>Then the something Ness of self goes away.</p>
<p>And when they get conflated or tangled together.</p>
<p>Then you get the illusion of self as thing, so the focus in is my reworking of.</p>
<p>The finding a spiritual self in the sense of becoming free from the limited.</p>
<p>Identity with thought and feeling.</p>
<p>My reworking of that divide and conquer but instead of using the 5:00 aggregates.</p>
<p>I just use the 3:00 subjective sensory elements.</p>
<p>So that's</p>
<p>One way to.</p>
<p>One strategy for finding a spiritual self focus out.</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p>Is based on more of Zen way of working so you having to work all day and you want to experience emerging with your environment well focus out.</p>
<p>Anchor in touch sight sound.</p>
<p>Feeling his talk to contracts touch sight sound expands easy to do, but are not easy, but natural to do as you're doing physical tests with physical tasks all about done sites out so you get the confusion that you get the confusion ethical values of working.</p>
<p>With the Taoist Spiritual paradigm of merge with the outside world.</p>
<p>So my focus out reworks that strategy.</p>
<p>Focus on rest is a reworking of the.</p>
<p>Absorption practices of early Buddhism, the idea. There is you discover a restful self. Actually, a restful selfina restful world.</p>
<p>I do that the restful self is instead of feel image talk. It's peaceful and quiet.</p>
<p>The restful world instead of touch side sound it's relaxation light silence.</p>
<p>So this forms an attenuated experience of self in world. Not quite the absolute no self in the world of the source.</p>
<p>But moving in that direction.</p>
<p>After all, the absorption practices are never claimed to be Nirvana.</p>
<p>But they're sort of moving in that direction, so they focus on rest is a reworking of that paradigm focus on positive.</p>
<p>Well, you're actively manipulating feeling which talk clearly this is related to things like the Brahmaviharas. The Loving kindness practices. Such of early Buddhism is also related to the deity yoga, practices of much later, Buddhism. The Bud Rihanna. What came after my honor.</p>
<p>From my perspective.</p>
<p>It's basically concentration clarity and equanimity in subject of space developed by actively manipulating subjective spaces imposter passively observing the way we do with focus in.</p>
<p>But certainly if you are manifesting.</p>
<p>Positive feel image talk.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>I don't know that it will necessarily turn you into a money magnet, but it will turn you into a People magnet that I can guarantee.</p>
<p>That that People will be attracted to you and that People will want to be with you and find you a source of.</p>
<p>Comfort and inspiration.</p>
<p>A priest Catholic priest once asked my teacher, Sasaki Roshi what his take on Christianity was.</p>
<p>And he said.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>It's about crucifixion and resurrection.</p>
<p>I totally believe in crucifixion and resurrection. Or she said that the price is all happy, all good. It's much.</p>
<p>You believe in resurrection, absolutely I totally believe in Reston.</p>
<p>And he does and crucifixion, but idea of crucifixion is.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>You get crucified by the source.</p>
<p>You get pinned and torn apart.</p>
<p>Stretched and nailed.</p>
<p>By the forces of expansion and contraction with something is within you dies, but then is resurrected.</p>
<p>As positive feel image toca better self because you could go to the source. You could die and it's like born again, but</p>
<p>Big time born again not a little time born again.</p>
<p>It's all about crucifixion and resurrection.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Focus on positive in its most advanced forms.</p>
<p>Actually comes is the new life that comes from the death.</p>
<p>That occurs.</p>
<p>Through focus on change.</p>
