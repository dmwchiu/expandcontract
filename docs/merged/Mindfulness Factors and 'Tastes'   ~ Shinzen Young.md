Each of those, 3 components grows.

On average overtime.

In specific at a specific time.

You could have.

A certain critical mass of concentration clarity and equanimity with regards to a specific experience.

And then that experience would become paradoxical it would be.

So fully present that it was absent, but it might be a fairly small experience and that might happen only sporadically.

On some days on some occasions certain experiences.

You get the sense of.

As it arose it completed so it never constellated into thing and when you look back and ask yourself. Why did that happen? Well, there was an extraordinary degree of concentration clarity and equanimity?

You know for those few seconds or for those few minutes with regards to this phenomenon typically that occurs initially with regards to pain in the sith that quote breaks up.

It's sort of still there, but it's not really there. That kind of thing is what I meant by critical mass.

Looked in the large picture, though over months years decades of practice. There is sort of hockey stick growth curve for all three of these elements, however, that growth curve has local fluctuations of peaks and valleys. Some days, it's your mindfulness factors are more evident other days, there less.

In the small picture, but then there's the large picture.

With regards to how you taste each of these that's a very good question.

Concentration has its own taste. It's impossible to describe in words. But once you experience it. You know what it tastes like. It's the in the zone taste OK, but how do you describe that taste to someone it's been fairly credibly scientifically documented the taste of concentration in and of itself is sensorially fulfilling.

This comes out of the positive psychology work that was done in Chicago by Mike Chick sent me high and others.

So it has its taste than you know you can taste it.

Equanimity has its taste, but it's impossible to really describe in words you develop a taste for it.

If I had to put it in the words, but this doesn't really.

Do it, but it's sort of like it's a knowing that because of the open way that you're experiencing this moment every moment of your future will be more fulfilling involved less suffering and you're also releasing stuff from the past. Some part of you knows that as a quantum eyes is some present sensory phenomenon that's the taste of equanimity.

So what's the taste of sensory clarity.

One is

Untangle ING.

You.

Say work with feel image talk individually collectively and there comes a time when you get a big fit storm.

OK, a big storm of it arises.

And because you have so much momentum of clarity, those elements don't get mixed.

They're just they have all three are happening simultaneously, but they are intrinsically.

Untangled in the arising and that's one of the tastes of clarity.

It's an unmixing flavor.

I don't know how to describe it. It's a D conflating which then.

Uh.

Removes.

There flooding effect that People get when many sensory phenomena are activated simultaneously. They're all still activated at once, but somehow there, not tangling with each other.

And when that reaches a critical mass self as thing goes away it just like evaporates.

So if you have a knot of flat screen, but conventional TV monitor that's a CRT.

2.

Uh.

So you look at it.

And let's say that it's showing a white pattern and I make the claim. There is no white on the screen. It's an illusion.

You say I'm crazy just look there's white anybody can see I say, Oh yeah, there's a magnifying glass. We agree this does nothing but resolve makes.

Clearer things that are falling together in tank it untangles visual experience.

So at some point.

The perception white goes away and the perception red, Green Blue arises.

Was there ever any white there?

That sensory clarity.

It's resolution power it's hi rez.

Higher and higher death.

The other direction that the sensory clarity goes is the ability to pick up faint during features signals.

Which is a power thing?

If you have signals that are very low power.

Very subtle.

There's a dimension of clarity.

Regarding the ability to detect those.

My favorite shibboleth subtle is significant.

So the flavors of sensation.

That.

Drive day-to-day perceptions and behaviors of human beings.

Most of them are initially below the threshold of awareness.

With practice.

They percolate up to specificity so you're able to detect finer and finer arisings, meaning that you're less and less likely to be hijacked by subliminal.

Images talked and especially by subliminal field In other words, Subliminal Fenomena very faint arisings have a huge impact on the subconscious.

On the subconscious without the conscious knowing.

This is the main difference between one of the main differences between the way that the subconscious is considered in western psychology and the weights considered in eastern psychology.

In the instance psychology it. There's a lot to it, but one of the dimensions that differs is you're interested in.

Making the real-time subconscious events.



That our sensory subconscious events. You know specific emotional flavors. Mental images talk that's very fated very subtle that's arising in the background.

That.

Becomes.

Perceptible through developing sensory clarity, so you're not hijacked by that during the day.

There's a third dimension.

Which is speed of detection?

Site.

Site.

Feel.

Already.

Already.

Side.

Feel.



You notice that.

I could start on a diet.

Site video.

There's no like OK, I need 5 minutes to sort of be with my breath, and then I can sort of figure out what's going on no no emphatic Lee now?

Feel.

You got to be able.

To do it instantly right in the thrust of any activity start on a dime.

So it's the ability to also immediately detect.

Do not have to like you know the typical well, I'll sit I'll sit for 10 minutes and then I can figure out what the Hell's going on inside of me no it's gotta be.

All rest.

Touch.

Anytime anyplace.

1/2 of US quarter of a second you're off and running why. Because in a half a second. The terrorists are in the cockpit.





So.

Ah, maybe the speed of detection is another clarity. I'm thinking as I'm sort of obviously making it up as I'm going but so the resolution piece.

The.

The ability to detect subtle things and the ability to immediately be mindful.

Without having to sort of get grounded or whatever People do, maybe those are the 3 dimensions.

But growth in the clarity.
