<p>You said that.</p>
<p>There's like this thing.</p>
<p>That, it only wants one thing it's like monotonic.</p>
<p>It knows nothing it's a force and it's a command and it's one command only.</p>
<p>B.</p>
<p>And it doesn't respect any normal distinctions.</p>
<p>We make</p>
<p>Either normal ones that humans make or the ones that we make when we construct the techniques.</p>
<p>Like OK, we're going to distinguish visual auditory semantic Internet or active restful OK. This doesn't respect any boundaries.</p>
<p>All it says is</p>
<p>We can say it a million ways live.</p>
<p>Get big.</p>
<p>Be everything is not bad?</p>
<p>And there is the.</p>
<p>There is its complement.</p>
<p>It's exactly the same except it says exactly the opposite says die.</p>
<p>It says get small says below.</p>
<p>And up no sooner is one present than the other his press.</p>
<p>That's what you.</p>
<p>You you made a certain spatial metaphor of like OK.</p>
<p>You know you put brushing from this side is pulling up from the other side that particular physics metaphor might not be.</p>
<p>The right metaphor, but it's the right general idea.</p>
<p>Are they generate each other?</p>
<p>Up.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>A man feels more masculine in the presence of a woman in converse with.</p>
<p>Generate.</p>
<p>But their own can't.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>You're absolutely correct.</p>
<p>There.</p>
<p>Eric maybe</p>
<p>They represent complementary flavors of.</p>
<p>Nutrition.</p>
<p>And we're like babies.</p>
<p>And we want to be sometimes. We want to be held by Daddy. Sometimes we want to be helped by Mommy sometimes we want to be held by both.</p>
<p>Sometimes we wanted just crawl off on.</p>
<p>But as long as we can know that we can.</p>
<p>Have look all of those on demand.</p>
<p>We already exercise.</p>
<p>So this is the adult version of South.</p>
<p>Of perfect parenting.</p>
<p>To say.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>The adult is now the infant write an?</p>
<p>Mommy and Daddy are perfect parents from their perspective.</p>
<p>Now from the babies perspective well that's another story because most of the babies.</p>
<p>Aren't even aware?</p>
<p>They've never lost their cosmic, Mommy dead.</p>
<p>So the sense that they kind of want to tear you apart.</p>
<p>Like a kid who?</p>
<p>Doesn't understand like? Why do I need to eat? I'm crying? I'm suffering? Why you kind of feed me that sort of like like strange well.</p>
<p>It is absolutely the case that expansion and contraction will tear you apart.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>It's like being in the hands of the cosmic pizza chef.</p>
<p>Is being stretched and pounded?</p>
<p>Hall and in the process the lumps get work done.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>It.</p>
<p>It does feel like your being torn up hard.</p>
<p>All.</p>
<p>But then as you get used to it, it feels like. Instead, the paradigm shifts from.</p>
<p>Please the forces of life and death are tearing me apart.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>I am giving myself back to</p>
<p>Watt, I'm giving back what I got from father. I'm giving that back to 5. I'm giving back what I got from mother to mother.</p>
<p>And the</p>
<p>The.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>So it's Donna.</p>
<p>But it's what you originally got from them. It's everything inside of you that.</p>
<p>Says Yes,</p>
<p>Joins.</p>
<p>The cosmic yes.</p>
<p>And everything inside of me that says no joins the cosmic now.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>That's that's the yes and then Oh that's big enough to mold this, or any conceivable universe.</p>
<p>And then you become that.</p>
<p>You become that.</p>
<p>For a moment or a longer duration, depending on practice, etc, etc. So at first you think that these forces are tearing it apart.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>I guess we could say there are 2 basic phobias right.</p>
<p>Claustrophobia and adorable it's too small an it's too big.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Humankind to bear.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>But then when we get over that phobia.</p>
<p>The paradigm shifts from father and mother, a tearing me apart too. I'm giving myself back to father and mother, too. I am participating in the activity of father and mother.</p>
<p>And have everything I could possibly.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p>And we're done.</p>
