I will say in appreciation of the Zen tradition.

That there is a certain kind of dynamic vitality in the Zen style of enlightenment. It's just a style, it's not like.

You know all wells. Zen starts where all this other stuff and it's not that way, at all. I think that's just BS to claim that but the way that the People express' enlightenment in their actions has a kind of bouncy vitality to it that spontaneity that is the result of a certain style of cultivation. That's where I see the strongest impact of style.

People can get enlightenment, doing vipasana practice and sometimes it's a sort of inert enlightenment, it that it's great compared to non enlightenment. Crime rates, just open person, but there can sometimes be a kind of flatness to it not imaginatively just saying sometimes.

Whereas the Zen People had this sort of bouncy experience of nothingness that they're able to convey what part of the practice of this is the lifestyle. Zen lifestyle where C basically if I were to contrast free puzzle Enzen Gross oversimplification. I would say that in Vipasa, not you, you observe your experience 1st.

And you come to an experience of the flow of impermanence and then maybe somewhere down the line. Maybe you begin to ride on that flow of impermanence in how you speak to move in the world in Zen before you realize the impermanent nature of experience. The lifestyle is forcing you to ride on impermanence because you have to run around and stop on a dime run around like crazy stop on it run around like crazy stuff, I don't die.

OK and sounds like my life well, no because in daily life that just leads to phonetic. Nesson, confusion, but within the context of Zen training if it works out well. It leads to an ability to manifest and disappear manifested disappear. In your actions and then with time you come to experience that as being the nature of experience so you sort of act it out first and then realize it.

Kind of this so employers it be possi not you realize it.

And then maybe right on it or maybe not so the advantage to the Zen training when it really works is that it guarantees. This dynamic expression of Enlightenment, the possible disadvantages because it is in some ways sort of like daily life. Maybe if it doesn't work. All it's going to end up doing is making you phonetic and confused so there's advantages and disadvantages that be possible way of working.

May not lead to the vitality, but it's like a paint by numbers kit. It's likely to at least we do something like a work of art. Zen is something then it's sort of like here's the canvas. There's the paints now do it. But when it works. It has a stemming vitality to it, but you may not find in the paint by numbers kit.
