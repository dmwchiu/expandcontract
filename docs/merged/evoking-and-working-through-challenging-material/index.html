<p>Percolates up spontaneously that is negatives.</p>
<p>From memories and so forth it can only come up as some combination of feeling which talk so you simply apply the focus in technique to it, you untangle the strands. You open up to them you give it permission to last as long or as short as it wants and that's as you say if that's unfinished business. Then this finishes the business, or at least is part of ongoing process that you know maybe.</p>
<p>A year later, some more has to percolate up, but you're fostering the finishing finishing of the business, or another way to put it is that your.</p>
<p>You're letting the ghosts out of the cellar and you know they dissipate and are gone.</p>
<p>So typically.</p>
<p>That's</p>
<p>How one deals with negatives now when you say?</p>
<p>Focus on negative OK that could have a different meaning because focus on positive means intentionally Holden radiate. The positive OK. So no there is no technique to intentionally Holden radiate. The negatives in my system so in that sense, yes, I apologize it's asymmetrical.</p>
<p>There is something it's not really a focus on negative because you know focus on positive you're attempting to nurture positive content and there's no way we're going to nurture negative con content. However, there is something that People frequently ask about which is well do I have to wait for it to spontaneously arise? Can I evoke something that I know is problematic and then observed.</p>
<p>Then apply the deconstruction of practice to it, the answer is yes, subject to a couple constraints.</p>
<p>The first constraint is I would not make that the centerpiece of mindfulness practice because.</p>
<p>Then you are doing psychotherapy, you're not doing mindfulness, but it's OK to do that on occasion.</p>
<p>The second is to sort of know how to do it, so as to optimize.</p>
<p>The mindfulness cathartic component by that I mean?</p>
<p>If you consider.</p>
<p>Why you have heard the expression like?</p>
<p>What are some of the expressions like OK rattle your cage?</p>
<p>Is when it's a negative or ring your Bell? When it's a positive OK So what does that mean?</p>
<p>If you look at the act if the Bell stands for the sun's car as the storm materials.</p>
<p>So you can with intentions strike that Bell by bringing up some feel image dog typically a negative. You know an issue so you, you strike the body mind Bell.</p>
<p>Intentionally, but then it's like hands off, and you let it resonate and you observe.</p>
<p>You don't strike it again until it completely dies down.</p>
<p>And then you strike it again.</p>
<p>At some point.</p>
<p>You may find this happens.</p>
<p>And that could be actually at the very beginning.</p>
<p>In which case.</p>
<p>You don't.</p>
<p>Evoke that thing the idea is it needs to be something that will resonate on its own.</p>
<p>Readily, after evoking freeing up all your enerji to now apply the technique to it. So you can't be constantly trying to beat it like strike it into existence and deconstruct it. But if you find a Bell that that resumes so you strike it and now?</p>
<p>However, suddenly you can still detect it.</p>
<p>As it damps.</p>
<p>And then strike it again and for some time. At some point it. You can't evoke it anymore. You're done for that session.</p>
<p>So I call that evoking and it's not a focus on negative, but it's a little related to what you broke brought uh.</p>
