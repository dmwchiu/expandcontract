So what did you say?

You said that.

There's like this thing.

That, it only wants one thing it's like monotonic.

It knows nothing it's a force and it's a command and it's one command only.

B.

And it doesn't respect any normal distinctions.

We make

Either normal ones that humans make or the ones that we make when we construct the techniques.

Like OK, we're going to distinguish visual auditory semantic Internet or active restful OK. This doesn't respect any boundaries.

All it says is

We can say it a million ways live.

Get big.

Be everything is not bad?

And there is the.

There is its complement.

It's exactly the same except it says exactly the opposite says die.

It says get small says below.

And up no sooner is one present than the other his press.

That's what you.

You you made a certain spatial metaphor of like OK.

You know you put brushing from this side is pulling up from the other side that particular physics metaphor might not be.

The right metaphor, but it's the right general idea.

Are they generate each other?

Up.

Ah.

A man feels more masculine in the presence of a woman in converse with.

Generate.

But their own can't.

So.

You're absolutely correct.

There.

Eric maybe

They represent complementary flavors of.

Nutrition.



And we're like babies.

And we want to be sometimes. We want to be held by Daddy. Sometimes we want to be helped by Mommy sometimes we want to be held by both.

Sometimes we wanted just crawl off on.

But as long as we can know that we can.

Have look all of those on demand.

We already exercise.

So this is the adult version of South.

Of perfect parenting.



To say.



Uh.

The adult is now the infant write an?

Mommy and Daddy are perfect parents from their perspective.

Now from the babies perspective well that's another story because most of the babies.

Aren't even aware?

They've never lost their cosmic, Mommy dead.

So the sense that they kind of want to tear you apart.

Like a kid who?

Doesn't understand like? Why do I need to eat? I'm crying? I'm suffering? Why you kind of feed me that sort of like like strange well.

It is absolutely the case that expansion and contraction will tear you apart.

Um.

It's like being in the hands of the cosmic pizza chef.

Is being stretched and pounded?

Hall and in the process the lumps get work done.

And.

It.

It does feel like your being torn up hard.

All.

But then as you get used to it, it feels like. Instead, the paradigm shifts from.

Please the forces of life and death are tearing me apart.

2.

I am giving myself back to

Watt, I'm giving back what I got from father. I'm giving that back to 5. I'm giving back what I got from mother to mother.

And the

The.

And.

So it's Donna.

But it's what you originally got from them. It's everything inside of you that.

Says Yes,

Joins.

The cosmic yes.

And everything inside of me that says no joins the cosmic now.

And.

That's that's the yes and then Oh that's big enough to mold this, or any conceivable universe.

And then you become that.

You become that.

For a moment or a longer duration, depending on practice, etc, etc. So at first you think that these forces are tearing it apart.

Um.

I guess we could say there are 2 basic phobias right.

Claustrophobia and adorable it's too small an it's too big.

4.

Humankind to bear.

Um.

But then when we get over that phobia.

The paradigm shifts from father and mother, a tearing me apart too. I'm giving myself back to father and mother, too. I am participating in the activity of father and mother.

And have everything I could possibly.

Forever.

And we're done.
