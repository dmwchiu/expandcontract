<p>My first teacher.</p>
<p>Was this sica?</p>
<p>It was just like summer I actually is like he was really macho and the way you talked and he was.</p>
<p>He was the.</p>
<p>He was the president of the smoke club I mean. He wasn't himself built like the but the smoke club are the students at the University that do small and he was the advisor and usually those kinds of People are soda.</p>
<p>Clohesy militaristic types, you know get into the martial arts and things like So what he would do is when at the end of each set ring the Bell to endless. It just before he would ring the Bell would be sitting there for an hour right. It was then the whole. Zen thing, although he was a shingle and Mumbai Linneage, but he trained in this end tradition an?</p>
<p>Just before you hit the Bell he delivered like.</p>
<p>Some sort of one line zingers sound bite.</p>
<p>And then like hit the belt you know it was like really dramatic 'cause you're the really deep state you know it's like.</p>
<p>It's brainwashing right you're being indoctrinated because it really hits. You right so I remember but it's good brain washing. I'm very grateful that I had that so I remember once.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Looks like we're all sitting on it.</p>
<p>10:30 I doggies servers on my tools on my job.</p>
<p>Go home but what it means is the some the Samadi that you go into and come out of.</p>
<p>Is not somebody?</p>
<p>Meaning so it took me years to really understand. I thought I understood what you meant but I didn't really understand what I thought he meant is OK stay in these states all the time, which is true. I mean that's part of what you meant but the deeper understanding is.</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>When you</p>
<p>When you're in a certain state and it's.</p>
<p>Time to</p>
<p>Start taking care of business, whatever businesses go to the washroom or.</p>
<p>Drive to work or you know make breakfast.</p>
<p>You're in this something and now it's time to the tendency is to want to. In some way go back to the normal way of being.</p>
<p>And then OK I'm going to function.</p>
<p>It's like OK well that was great, but now let's get back to the real world.</p>
<p>And the trick is to just not do that.</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p>Whatever function needs to arise.</p>
<p>Simply happens from that state.</p>
<p>At U channel whatever doing needs to be done.</p>
<p>And if that causes fear or disorientation.</p>
<p>UE quantum eyes, it and you throw caution to the wind and you just function and that's one of the ways that that Zen bounces trained.</p>
<p>So I would say when that happens.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>If you</p>
<p>Have to transition to some action.</p>
<p>Fine just</p>
<p>You know you don't leave.</p>
<p>You may come out of somebody but you don't need to leave somebody in order to function.</p>
<p>And if you come out.</p>
<p>Why do you come out you come out because?</p>
<p>The inner system reactivates.</p>
<p>And if you see where that re activation comes from.</p>
<p>You actually see.</p>
<p>The self being born from the notes nansel.</p>
<p>Then.</p>
<p>You're just fine there's no.</p>
<p>No no difficulties whatsoever and integrating I don't know if that was.</p>
<p>What you were asking about but?</p>
<p>OK, I think we're good for now.</p>
