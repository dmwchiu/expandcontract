<p>Who is a compulsive eater?</p>
<p>Overcomes their eating compulsion.</p>
<p>They don't stop eating.</p>
<p>They continue to eat, but they eat in a different way.</p>
<p>It's not driven.</p>
<p>And it's healthier.</p>
<p>With regards to our.</p>
<p>Mind.</p>
<p>The mind has a certain drive.</p>
<p>To find meaning.</p>
<p>That drive I think is in some way intrinsic to the image talk circuits themselves.</p>
<p>But also is linked to feel.</p>
<p>If we can't define Feliz emotional body sensation.</p>
<p>When the mind finds meaning.</p>
<p>You'll find a smile on your face.</p>
<p>Aura Rosiness in your chest or a free song, a kind of ripple of pleasant excitement through your body.</p>
<p>When the mind fails to find meaning.</p>
<p>When the mind is confused muddled spinning to no avail.</p>
<p>Then you'll find in the body sensations of fear and tear.</p>
<p>And impatience agitation and so forth.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>The drive to find meaning involves I believe a certain intrinsic drive in the image talk circuits.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>A stab Lish pattern.</p>
<p>And then some juice in the body, particularly with regards to the pleasure associated with.</p>
<p>Finding answers and the discomfort in the body associated with being confused or not having answers, especially fear and.</p>
<p>Sadness flavors.</p>
<p>So some combination of forces within feel image talk drive us to have meeting.</p>
<p>We can train ourselves into equanimity with don't know.</p>
<p>It's a systematic training.</p>
<p>The medieval Christians called the Doctor Ignorantia or trained.</p>
<p>Ignorance.</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks call that epic E. Apple Hey in their pronunciation meeting to suspend suspend what suspend the need to have answers.</p>
<p>Inzan it's called don't know mind.</p>
<p>This can be systematically trained.</p>
<p>Meaning that when can systematically work through the forces?</p>
<p>In image talk and feel that drive us to have meaning.</p>
<p>Now, why is it? Why is it important to do that? Well, I would say several reasons.</p>
<p>For one thing inevitably we will be faced with.</p>
<p>The inability to find meaning.</p>
<p>Every new thing we know raises new questions so our don't know grows faster than our do know.</p>
<p>By our I mean, the human species, so we have to.</p>
<p>Except the fact that will always be facing don't know, and in fact, a major theme in modern mathematics and modern physics.</p>
<p>Is the limits of? What even can be known or at least known in certain ways?</p>
<p>Google's</p>
<p>Undecidability underside ability and incompleteness theorems heisenberg uncertainty in.</p>
<p>Physics and so forth point us directly to don't know. In fact point could be made that.</p>
<p>The stability of the known universe in that it depends on Heisenberg. Uncertainty depends on God's equanimity with don't know.</p>
<p>Anyway so sooner or later we and probably God are faced with don't know I'm being somewhat. Metaphorical and humorous. I think you understand on the theoretical level and then on the practical level, Hey, we're going to get old.</p>
<p>Or Gonna and as we get older our mental faculties. Deteriorate I can see for myself. I'm 65 and I can see it's downhill. I'm past my intellectual peak.</p>
<p>But that doesn't freak me out because I have made friends with don't know I've made friends with my own impending stupidity. There was a famous 20th century mathematician that I like a lot. It was quite eccentric named Paul air dish. ERDOS is how you write that name and he wanted to have put on his gravestone. I don't know if they actually did it, but what he said put on my gravestone.</p>
<p>Is at last? I'm not getting stupider anymore?</p>
<p>So I can see I'm sort of getting gradually getting stupider, but that's OK, so theoretically and practically sooner or later. We have to face don't know there is a need to deal with the need to know and Fortunately. There is a way of doing that. The other reason why it's good to be able to deal with don't know is that?</p>
<p>As you remember on the metaphor of the compulsive eater when the compulsive eater has worked through their compulsion to eat it? Don't stop beating in fact, they eat in much more fulfilling new way.</p>
<p>When a human being works through the need to have answers. They don't stop having answers. They start having answers in a deeply fulfilling an radical new way. That's why Christians in the Middle Ages and the Greeks in classical antiquity. At least some of them cultivated this and it's the basis also for the Zen koan practice is like? What's the sound of one hand and so forth.</p>
<p>This new way of knowing.</p>
<p>We have a name for it.</p>
<p>We call it wisdom function.</p>
<p>So both because we don't want to suffer.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that don't know is inevitable.</p>
<p>And also on the positive side when we work through the need to know we get to know in a radical new way called?</p>
<p>Insight or if you wish wisdom or even in its morgue most extreme form enlightenment.</p>
<p>For these reasons.</p>
<p>There is a need to work through the need to know.</p>
