<p>We came here, mostly what we were doing.</p>
<p>Sodom.</p>
<p>Which means work on ourselves for ourselves?</p>
<p>When we leave we should continue our sodom.</p>
<p>I mentioned the factors.</p>
<p>Needed for success.</p>
<p>A short term investment to learn some terminology and concepts a short-term investment to learn one or more.</p>
<p>Focusing techniques.</p>
<p>A long term investment to apply those concepts and techniques. Actually, a lifelong investment to apply those concepts and techniques in daily life.</p>
<p>And the establishment of a rhythm of day-to-day practice.</p>
<p>And periodic retreat.</p>
<p>So this is retrained.</p>
<p>Why do we come to retreats?</p>
<p>Several things not just one.</p>
<p>One thing we build up momentum all day everyday what we've been doing practice all our waking hours.</p>
<p>I've been practicing and stillness in motion in life.</p>
<p>A momentum builds up.</p>
<p>That will often take us to new levels.</p>
<p>But if we didn't back it up with day-to-day practice than those might be peak experiences. But if we back it up with day-to-day practice. They tend to be plateaus from which we can then grow more.</p>
<p>As a tendency.</p>
<p>So momentum is important.</p>
<p>An important reason why People do retreats.</p>
<p>Another thing that happens at retreats is we get social network and social support from the other meditators.</p>
<p>We also get an environment where it's easy to practice.</p>
<p>Relatively.</p>
<p>Of course, the name of the game is freedom. So you have to be willing to practice in environments where it's not easy to practice also.</p>
<p>And then we get contact with teachers.</p>
<p>People that can give us input into our practice, we get private interviews different kinds of contact with teachers.</p>
<p>When I sent the factors that you needed. I mentioned those 4 things you might have might have thought well something's missing communities missing. The teachers have a say no that's implied in retreat for most People. The source of social support and peer support and the source of professional input comes when you do retreats.</p>
<p>And then many teachers will give you a contact that you can contact them in between retreats.</p>
<p>Upon leaving the retreat continue your sodden.</p>
<p>The other side of this practice is safe, a service. We talked about that.</p>
<p>I'm leaving the retreat services very big because.</p>
<p>You're going to be teaching.</p>
<p>You're going to be doing a lot of teaching.</p>
<p>I'm leaving this retreat.</p>
<p>Maybe you're saying wait this is the first feature diver did what do you mean I'm going to be doing a lot of teaching? Well, you know that I define teaching in a very Broadway.</p>
<p>Anybody that changes as the result of doing this practice that change in their life is a teaching that's a sermon to the People around them.</p>
<p>If you are changing for the better as the result of this practice, then that means you are teaching because you just carry that with you.</p>
<p>That's the subtle level of teaching.</p>
<p>Then there's the descriptive level of teaching.</p>
<p>Hopefully you've thought about how you could describe this practice 2 People.</p>
<p>And when People ask you. Hey, what happened at the retreat you can give a coherent description.</p>
<p>Of.</p>
<p>What is like?</p>
<p>That's a kind of teacher.</p>
<p>So you will be teaching.</p>
<p>Some of you are moving into the more explicit role of teaching actually showing People what to do.</p>
<p>And that's wonderful.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Continue your sod in AM.</p>
<p>Continue your safe.</p>
<p>You know the</p>
<p>The.</p>
<p>Idiom.</p>
<p>I hope it was as good for you as it was for me, you all heard this right.</p>
<p>Well, I hope this retreat was as good for you as it was for me.</p>
<p>This was really good for me.</p>
<p>Because of you.</p>
<p>Working with you the privilege of working with you.</p>
<p>Of contributing to your growth.</p>
<p>You folks did a lot of quality work here.</p>
<p>And so it was really fun and empowering and encourage ING and enlivening for me.</p>
<p>To be able to be part of that it's a privilege to do this kind of work that I get to spend time with People like you.</p>
<p>A body Safa in Tibetan there, sometimes called Simba Chambo.</p>
<p>It means a great hero or heroine of consciousness.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I want to thank each and everyone of you for.</p>
<p>Who you are?</p>
<p>What you're becoming and?</p>
<p>For the gift that you've given me this retreat.</p>
