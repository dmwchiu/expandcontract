One of the sensory experiences that you focus on is a restful state, which is the darkness brightness in front of or behind your clothes eyes. I call that I say that represents a blank mental screen.

Now, although that that darkness brightness could be stable in which case actually that can be good. That becomes what's called a Casina and that can stabilize consciousness and become a basis for absorption states on the other hand, very often that darkness brightness is sort of swirling vibrating or whatever.

That's impermanence that's flow.

And most People at least occasionally get that sense of flow in the blank on their mental screen. And if you focus on it. The more you focus on it. The more fluid. It becomes it becomes sort of massages. You it comforts you and so forth so.

My generic term for continuous type changes is flow and then if something disappears. That's gone banishing so in the restful aspect of image space, then maybe flow images come they?

Typically they disappear, so that's a vanishing even when they're rising. They may fade in fade out melt morph so there's usually some even if there's image activity. There's some sense of change what can be really interesting. This doesn't happen to a lot of People but sometimes you can have mental images that they're like they're real. They're like alive. There animated from inside just like living things, the 3D.

And they just move as though God's hand inside a puppet making this thing animated.

Sometimes People get freaked out when that happens, but if you.

Just get fascinated with the flow of expansion and contraction in those realistic images.

Then you're going to go to the source.

That's going to take you to the formless doing that molds, not only those those images, but the visual so-called material world everything.

In other words, If you ever have not that this happens very often, but sometimes People quote see spirits and whatever there's two ways that you can relate to that. One is well it's sort of a message and you can honor its content.

But that's the world of powers and that has its place. But what we would prefer is that you be not be so interested in that message, but be interested in the movement of the medium.

Because when you're seeing spirits you're very close to seeing the great spirit. But you have to let go of your preoccupation with spirits and just see the underlying.

Pure flow of formless enerji that is what is behind making them seem so real?

I know half the People hearing this are.

I'll never experience that I never experienced that OK and the other half is I hope I don't experience that well.

Some People experiences and if you do you'll know how to make use of it as a liberation path as opposed to either something that wigs you out or something that shuts you off into.

A lesser God, let's put it that way.

So, in your visual thinking, either the acted the restful aspect of the blank or the active aspect of image activity. There could be flow. Things could vanish things could change and move in Melton morph and you could decide to focus on that and a sort of ride on that get fascinated with it. The more you focus the more pronounced. It gets that's the theme of flow and go in visual thinking about auditory thinking well. Sometimes it is not too much happening there.

There's a kind of quiet but then there's an underlying current a kind of buzz. That's a kind of Vibra. Tori flow in the subtle auditory processing.

In Tibetan that's called numbed oke oke. Jane they actually have a term for that. A technical term numb dope means thinking and Oak means underneath or beneath and G means us stream.

So I took great pleasure in finding out that this thing that I had always called subtle processing and made part and parcel as you know of the techniques. Sure enough into bed. It was known and they have a technical term for it and somebody told me that Tibetan scholar, a couple of months ago anyway. So you can have that subtle sort of Vibra. Tori flow and talk space and even when you have explicit words in talk space. They may boom in talk space that's expanding.

That's expensive flow. They made grip and hold you. That's contracted flow so in your auditory thoughts. You could have flowing experiences and what's interesting about what I call talk or auditory thinking has some sort of interesting characteristics. One is for most People, the hardest to stop and not that I'm advocating you stop it. But if you try to stop it. It's hard to stop it.

But it's very easy to initiate you can think about anything you wanted talk space. You can repeat a mantra or some litany and there's a lot of control and initiating talk. It's really hard to stop doing it once it gets going the other interesting thing is.

That.

Talk is probably the easiest sensory phenomenon within which to notice abrupt vanishings.

People will often report this to me as though it were a problem. It's like as soon as I notice. My internal talk. It disappears what am I doing wrong. It's not a problem. That's an insight insight into impermanence. So you can note the Vanishings. The Ganz so as you can see the mind is mental experience visual thinking an auditory thinking.

Has a lot of potential for impermanence for focusing on the theme of change about the body? Well, if you sort of zoom out and cover your whole body.

It's pretty hard to keep the whole thing in awareness an perfectly stable. It tends to puff out a little here pull in a little bit there. That's flow.

There is sometimes People get tingling vibration undulation that's flow a problem that People report in the body is.

There's pressure and People usually blame themselves for it's like well, something is trying to expand but I'm resisting it kind of thing they make themselves responsible if you have pressure.

You can ask yourself is it inward outward or bidirectional and instead of making it a problem. Just lookup on it as force flow.

Pressure is actually momentum flux, so you can look up on that as a kind of flow. Einstein did so, instead of making pressures something I'm resisting or I'm fighting or I'm whatever it's just there's an outward force so that's an expansion whether there's even if there's no volume metric change. It is an expensive flavor of flow in that forces.

Blowing out pressure force inward and just yield to it, it might make it worse for a little while, but then at some point.

You get a sense it. Yes, that's not a problem that's part of the flow of nature, too.
