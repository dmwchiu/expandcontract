<p>Never completely separate 'cause.</p>
<p>Neither I nor the Dow what you used to call the int the world, the other.</p>
<p>Other pieces of matter other People and so forth.</p>
<p>You see both the eye and the Dow coming from and returning to the same womb of zero moment by moment.</p>
<p>And how</p>
<p>0 breaks apart and vibrates.</p>
<p>Out and in.</p>
<p>And for men's space into existence and then that space further vibrates.</p>
<p>And begins to think and feel and.</p>
<p>Either either.</p>
<p>Things.</p>
<p>I am a thing.</p>
<p>And is vulnerable.</p>
<p>Or thanks.</p>
<p>I just came from the source.</p>
<p>And is in some sense in vulnerable.</p>
<p>The former case is what usually happens.</p>
<p>The latter case is something called enlightenment.</p>
<p>What we're talking about here is empowering?</p>
<p>Unification.</p>
<p>However, the way I'd like to look up on the path it's based on contrasts.</p>
<p>Empowering contrasts.</p>
<p>One of the contrast is between.</p>
<p>Oneness.</p>
<p>That is a healthy Oneness.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Discrimination, which is a healthy discrimination.</p>
<p>And we don't want to get one sided on one side or the other so.</p>
<p>The kind of Oneness that I'm describing is does, I would say is desirable for humans.</p>
<p>However, it's also desirable to make empowering discriminations.</p>
<p>And to go back and forth. It's a dialectical process dialectical means back and forth.</p>
<p>So you experience Oneness, but then you're not averse to making distinctions again a person that says Oh I only want to be in flow an emptiness.</p>
<p>And I'm unwilling to track feel image talk as objects.</p>
<p>I'm unwilling to track touch sight and sound as an object Oh that will Mayer me in self and Materi Ality.</p>
<p>No tracking in those ways.</p>
<p>That's making empowering distinctions that's making distinctions that allow you to untangle and be free. That's making distinctions that allow you to go from.</p>
<p>Multiplicative overwhelm when things get.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Tangled to additive manageability when things get.</p>
<p>Teased apart.</p>
<p>I like to think that there's this list of categories that contain all and only the most important empowering healthy distinctions that we need to make for psychological personal growth and for spiritual transpersonal growth.</p>
<p>So we can distinguish.</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p>Visual on somatic versus visual versus auditory.</p>
<p>Obviously, an within those we can distinguish.</p>
<p>The more subjective somatic visual and auditory feel image talked the more object. If so somatic visual and auditory touch sight. Sound then corresponding to those 6 ordinary sensory experiences. We have to be willing to put taste into taste and smell and touch. That sort of covers ordinary sensory experiences. Then there's some special restful states, 6 corresponding to the 6:00 ordinary active states.</p>
<p>And those are very useful to discriminate because they lead to very pleasant tranquil experiences.</p>
<p>So those are discriminations.</p>
<p>There are I think are very healthy.</p>
<p>To be able to tease those things out.</p>
<p>To be able to break the thinking process into visual versus auditory so thought becomes tangible and spatial and therefore trackable.</p>
<p>And therefore tractable if you can keep track of it or you can train better. Still more accurately. Still, you train. The depths of your being to automatically keep track of these kinds of distinctions.</p>
<p>Then they become tractable, meaning a source of fulfillment and not a source of suffering empowering healthy distinctions.</p>
<p>Healthy Oneness.</p>
<p>Back and forth, back and forth over and over again marks the path to Psycho spiritual super adulthood.</p>
