There's one other experience that was very dramatic when I did my first.

Retreat in the robot Ken Method, which is body sweeping at that time, I'd had a 10 year very intense addiction of marijuana.

And but they won't let you use substances? Which is fine. I made that I was sweeping through my body and I notice this very subtle little discomfort around my lungs and whatever no big deal, but knew it was sort of associated with maybe all the small guy was booting in there.

But nothing intense no thoughts about it or whatever when I came back from that retreat.

Apparently, the part of my body that was enjoying the marijuana on the part of my body that was being damaged by the marijuana communicated below the threshold of awareness because I had.

Sort of.

Clarified the body for the body and nothing to do with my mind whatsoever.

But when I went home.

That addiction disappeared spontaneously and never came back.

And that was very impressive you know it's like wow. I didn't have to struggle. There was no on the wagon off the wagon kind of stuff or struggling with it, it was gone.

My body had decided was this before or after the.

No boundaries exposure.

There's no boundaries doesn't guarantee that your bad habits go away. You spend the rest of your life refining yourself.

So I would say yeah, those 4 over a period of 40 years. That's like one per decade, there's are good ones, so there's every 10 years.
