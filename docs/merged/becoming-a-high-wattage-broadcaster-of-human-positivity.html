It was a Vietnamese ethnic temple in Los Angelus.</p>
<p>You may remember the news footage of the People like clinging on to the helicopters in Saigon. You're trying to get out and whatever, So what happened was that there was this huge influx of Vietnamese refugees and they were sent to marine camps dedicated marine camps throughout the United States and one of the big places they were set was Camp Pendleton, which is San Diego in Southern California.</p>
<p>And the temple where I was living the international Buddhist meditation center was in LA And.</p>
<p>It was really interesting to see the Marines in action.</p>
<p>They realize that at least half of the People that were.</p>
<p>Coming into that camp would be Buddhist the other half would be Catholic 'cause That's sort of the religious breakdown in the country.</p>
<p>So they?</p>
<p>They could handle the Catholic because that's international you just get Catholic priest.</p>
<p>But they were smart enough to know that there were Buddhists.</p>
<p>Buddhist clergy in the United States and they were smart enough to. In fact, now that they were Americans that had been trained in the Vietnamese stuff, so the US Marines contract it with the temple.</p>
<p>Our temple.</p>
<p>To hire Buddhist clergy.</p>
<p>That would be there when those refugees arrived and they went out and they bought Buddha statues.</p>
<p>And they had these tents set up.</p>
<p>And it was there for these People that the night before it been hanging from the helicopters. They were that organized that was actually quite impressive.</p>
<p>So what happened was that.</p>
<p>We.</p>
<p>A whole bunch of us went down.</p>
<p>The morning after the thing of the people with the helicopters. We went down in a bus to Camp Pendleton.</p>
<p>And we could see People coming in buses, the People we'd seen on the news the night before hanging from the helicopters were being bused into this.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>It was amazing to see the look on their face.</p>
<p>When they saw Americans of all races in Vietnamese Buddhist robes.</p>
<p>And able to chant and do the liturgy.</p>
<p>In Vietnamese because well there's this expression to meet the Buddha in Hell. It's like for them. It's hell writes. The last thing in the world they would ever expect going to the United States on a military camp that the first thing they're going to see is native born Americans.</p>
<p>That are.</p>
<p>Capable of working within their tradition as Buddhist chaplains anyway. What was the reason I thought about this was.</p>
<p>There were among those refugees a certain number of Buddhist monks as you might imagine they were going to get out of the country, if it was going to go communist.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>I notice that there was among all the Buddhist monks there.</p>
<p>There was one that it was young, but no matter where you would see him he would always be surrounded by People.</p>
<p>It was like a People magnet.</p>
<p>And his English was pretty limited, but through a combination of his limited English, and writing in Chinese characters. 'cause I could write Chinese and he they learn how to monks in Vietnam were not right. Classical Chinese so through the limited English and US sort of writing back and forth with Chinese characters. I was able to talk to him.</p>
<p>His name was dumb one.</p>
<p>And I said it's like what's the deal.</p>
<p>You know use People seem to relate to you very differently from any any of the other clergy. Buddhist clergy this year. They said well my teacher taught me loving kindness practice.</p>
<p>From the very get go loving kindness is traditional version of the focus on positive feel so he was constantly from the time. He was just a little kid. He was trained to radiate this out and you could see the object if impact.</p>
<p>It had on the People around him.</p>
<p>So anyway, edit at an advanced level. It's not just going to be in your body. It's going to go out of the body in all 6 directions just like a high wattage broadcast of.</p>
<p>Human human.</p>
<p>Positive iti sound like a plan.</p>
