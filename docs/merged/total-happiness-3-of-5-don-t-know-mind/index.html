<p>The mind also needed to avoid something it needed to avoid not knowing it needed to avoid confused model states in order to be happy.</p>
<p>But in the</p>
<p>Demention of extraordinary happiness the mind can be completely confused.</p>
<p>And that not be a problem.</p>
<p>Now, when I say that the body can be in pain and that not be a problem. Maybe you think I'm cracked.</p>
<p>But maybe you think Well, you know that could happen because I've had some experience where I was once in pain. and I stop fighting it and didn't bother me, so much lot of People have had that kind of experience once or twice in their life so maybe if I say.</p>
<p>The statement, the body can be in pain in that not be a problem. Maybe I just sound a little cracked. I don't sound crack to everybody.</p>
<p>But if I say that the mind can be in confusion.</p>
<p>Even civility even Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>And that might be a problem then People think.</p>
<p>Maybe maybe is already too to be saying something like that.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>Equanimity with don't know.</p>
<p>Is the basis?</p>
<p>An extraordinary new kind of knowing.</p>
<p>This fact has been discovered independently by 3:00 cultures and that indicates to me that it's universal.</p>
<p>Totally independent without any contact with each other well there might have been some minimal historical contact. It was discovered by the ancient Greeks. the IT, meaning that you could suspend the need to know that you could train the mind away from its desperate need to have answers.</p>
<p>And when you did, that it would start to have answers in new ways.</p>
<p>That was discovered in ancient Greece by the sceptical philosophers who are called skeptics because instead of trying to find answers. They just observed skeptic costs, they watched.</p>
<p>So the like what we do, they didn't.</p>
<p>Ask questions like the other philosophers, they didn't debate.</p>
<p>They let go of the need to have answers.</p>
<p>And they discovered that if you do this in a consistent way as a discipline a disciplined suspension of the need to know.</p>
<p>A disciplined confusion.</p>
<p>A sustained confusion for a goal.</p>
<p>Leads to a revolution in consciousness.</p>
<p>They called the epic EEPOCHE, which means to suspend in this case, specifically suspend the need to know.</p>
<p>It was rediscovered in the Middle Ages by Christian monks and nuns who called it dope to ignore anti and now we're going from Greek to Latin.</p>
<p>That, it means.</p>
<p>Cultivated don't know doctor learn it literally cultivated don't know where Catholic center here Carmelite Retreat Center.</p>
<p>Venerable tradition.</p>
<p>So who is the highest authority on the area of Philosophy in the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>The decline is yes, Thomas Aquinas.</p>
<p>Who said</p>
<p>They own Tom Club pair ignorant ium cognis pillows.</p>
<p>In the language of the time.</p>
<p>If I were to paraphrase into fully modern English.</p>
<p>Would be if you want to know God directly. You have to know through a special kind of not knowing.</p>
<p>And then it was discovered in Tang Dynasty, China, where it was called don't know mind and other things.</p>
<p>Bodhi Dharma.</p>
<p>When he visited.</p>
<p>Imper.</p>
<p>Long long booty.</p>
<p>Emperor Wudi up the damn dynasty this master here visited the emperor.</p>
<p>And they had a dialogue the emperor was a great patron of Buddhism.</p>
<p>And the emperor asked Bodhi Dharma.</p>
<p>I fed many monks and nuns built many temples how much merit have I made to which Bodhidharma said none whatsoever.</p>
<p>I would sort of surprised the emperor and then the emperor asked him well. What's the highest principle of holiness to which he said wide open an nothing only.</p>
<p>Which.</p>
<p>Also surprised him very much.</p>
<p>And finally, he said, who are you to which body Dharma said I don't know.</p>
<p>So that's the Zen don't know mind 3 independent cultures have discovered that you can have equanimity with model and confusion. Now you might say well, OK, I can see that as a practice but come on senility, Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>I have had the privilege of being with senile Masters. I have had the privilege of being with Masters, who had advanced outsiders.</p>
<p>So I can report to you what it's like and it's.</p>
<p>It's not like but it's usually like.</p>
<p>It manifests in a very different way.</p>
<p>Because.</p>
<p>Of the practice in the realm of unconditional happiness.</p>
<p>The issue is not getting answers to this, or that for the mind.</p>
<p>The mines experience and the issue is not actually avoiding confusion for the mind.</p>
<p>The issue is getting the answer.</p>
<p>And the issue is avoiding confusion as a problem.</p>
<p>To have a meaningful experience of the meaningless.</p>
<p>So, in the realm of extraordinary happiness even if you were confused there would be a positive to that.</p>
<p>And even if you were.</p>
<p>Clinically, confused.</p>
<p>Due to medical condition.</p>
<p>It was still be on Okayness in that.</p>
<p>That's why we say that the realm of.</p>
<p>Extraordinary happiness is independent of conditions it's even independent of having having a functioning brain.</p>
<p>This is an extraordinary claim.</p>
<p>Independent of what condition the body and mind area if you are able to have a complete experience sensory experience of that touch field image talk state.</p>
<p>Then you will be happy.</p>
<p>In this realm, this dimension of extraordinary happiness.</p>
