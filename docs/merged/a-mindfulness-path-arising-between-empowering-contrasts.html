<p>The way that I present.</p>
<p>Mindfulness is based on.</p>
<p>Significant.</p>
<p>Distinctions.</p>
<p>Or perhaps a better way to put it significant contrasts.</p>
<p>Empowering contrasts.</p>
<p>Viva la difference.</p>
<p>Between Watt Well, a whole bunch of things.</p>
<p>There's a place on this path.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Making discriminations there's a place on this path for destroying discriminations.</p>
<p>There's a place on this path.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Breaking down.</p>
<p>The self in the world.</p>
<p>There's a place on this path for.</p>
<p>Building up the self and the world.</p>
<p>There's a place on this path for.</p>
<p>Bearing down.</p>
<p>And there's a place on this path for easing up.</p>
<p>So that means that the path.</p>
<p>Isn't a path?</p>
<p>It can't be fixated it arises in between.</p>
<p>A whole bunch of empowering contrasts.</p>
<p>Maturity on the path could be defined as learning how to work those contrasts.</p>
<p>How to get rid of the notion that they are somehow contradictions?</p>
<p>See them as complementarities.</p>
<p>And to know how to do.</p>
<p>Watt, at what time for optimal efficacy?</p>
<p>And that's just practice.</p>
<p>Practice practice practice you get the hang of it.</p>
<p>It's a matter of alternating.</p>
<p>If the labeling.</p>
<p>Makes you racy OK then try from dropping the labels see if you could still have clarity.</p>
<p>If that makes you Spacey then you have to label again.</p>
<p>There is no.</p>
<p>Answer to this accepted constantly remind People that there's no answer to this.</p>
<p>In other words, you have to constantly talk out of both sides of your mouth at once.</p>
<p>And say there's a place for bearing down there's a place for using up when a person needs to ease up. They don't hear that you said there's a place for using them they only here.</p>
<p>And Conversely.</p>
<p>There's just no way around it.</p>
<p>Sacular she has this great expression.</p>
<p>Shooting in my grocery.</p>
<p>It means that People tend to apply eye wash to their anus.</p>
<p>Right Medison wrong place.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>At.</p>
<p>The In other words.</p>
<p>If we say there's 2 sides to bear down you can ease up you can label you can drop labels.</p>
<p>You can even not note.</p>
<p>I did nothing for awhile.</p>
<p>Unfortunate.</p>
<p>There's some perverse principle where if we say you know you do one or the other.</p>
<p>Whatever one</p>
<p>Is that both convenient one for that for that person's?</p>
<p>Impurities to grab on to.</p>
<p>That's what bill.</p>
<p>So if they got ego around performance so here I gotta perform.</p>
<p>If they've got ego around. Hey, I need to cool out and just feel good and not work too hard.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Then they'll they'll they'll hear that well. I'm supposed to not do anything so there's no way around it. It always happens that way. No matter how many times you point out do it this way or this way.</p>
<p>There's somebody looking for this There's something learn from that until finally People figure it out.</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<p>The metaphor used by the of tuning the loot.</p>
<p>How do you tune a loot well?</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p>Tighten the string, but then it's a little too. Tight so you loosen you tighten you loosen and in between the tightening and loosening you just get a feel for.</p>
<p>Where the</p>
<p>Loot should be so between these empowering contrasts.</p>
<p>You are able to work and optimally use.</p>
<p>The various</p>
<p>Sides that are available to you.</p>
