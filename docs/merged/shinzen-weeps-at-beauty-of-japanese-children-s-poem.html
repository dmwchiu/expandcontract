<p>Every Japanese child has to learn the euro ha.</p>
<p>The Arrow Hot is the traditional.</p>
<p>Ordering of that Japanese script here are gonna are you aware that Japanese language is written in a combination of Kanji, which are Chinese characters and comma, which are Japanese syllables syllabaries.</p>
<p>And there's 2 kinds of comma, but the one that's normally used is called Hugh to Donna.</p>
<p>And the way that schoolchildren learn here. Dagama is they learn a pole.</p>
<p>A poem that contains.</p>
<p>It's syllable of the Japanese language once and only once.</p>
<p>And that poem is traditionally ascribed to Kobo Daishi also known as Cucuy.</p>
<p>And Cook I was the person who introduced xinggan into Japan from China.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>He.</p>
<p>Developed his linguistics sophistication.</p>
<p>Because he studied a little Sanskrit.</p>
<p>And the sand script Sanskrit Panini and such he was the people in India invented grammar. Really, the world's first scientific grammarian was Panini and because Xinggan uses montrosa lot.</p>
<p>And so they wanted to know Sanskrit, so they actually learned Phone a logical principles. They meaning the monks. The Shingon monks and they learned it based on Indec notions of linguistics.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>There, but there was a indirect.</p>
<p>Impact all the way from India.</p>
<p>All the way to Japan.</p>
<p>When the Japanese written language was first sort of developing in the hand period. It was shingle on monks that did it because they had linguistic sophistication and they created the off the?</p>
<p>Equivalent of their alphabet.</p>
<p>And so where where as you learn the ABC's.</p>
<p>A Japanese child learns this poll.</p>
<p>You know you know you at all cheering Ruble.</p>
<p>Wild Idol target so Soon Amara.</p>
<p>We know Oh Cuiaba, you're correct.</p>
<p>A sucky human BG.</p>
<p>A more cells.</p>
<p>That contains each syllable of the Japanese language exactly once.</p>
<p>All and then you, you memorize that poem and you learn the comma that way. And that's the direct influence of shingles on the Japanese language, which is absolutely indelible every Japanese person knows it.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>What does the pole mean?</p>
<p>It's very interesting.</p>
<p>You know means color.</p>
<p>You know why neo at all.</p>
<p>Although the colors are bright.</p>
<p>Chili noodle.</p>
<p>The flower will eventually fall to the ground.</p>
<p>Well go in this world of ours.</p>

<p>Sunil Laura,</p>
<p>Can expect?</p>
<p>To live forever.</p>
<p>We know Oakley AMA.</p>

<p>This is really incredibly beautiful who is the name of a place.</p>
<p>But it's a pun saw.</p>
<p>We know Oklahoma maybe you know what yama means in Japanese? What does it mean?</p>
<p>Mount Oh at Okayama means furthest mountains.</p>
<p>So we know.</p>
<p>Book we are map kill quiet day.</p>

<p>OK, you probably heard it this things that arise due to causality.</p>
<p>Anything other than Nirvana is a compound in thing. So we know Cuiaba today. We know Kuiama Kilcoyne. Today crossing the farthest mountain of the village of GUI.</p>

<p>No longer</p>
<p>Will I be subject to?</p>
<p>Superficial greens.</p>
