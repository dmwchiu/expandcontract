Get very good point because normally it's like what I have People to do when they're freaking out and paying and emotions and things. But if you do it in positive then it turns into Bliss City.

You can do it with restful also there's uh.

Prime example of zooming in and out at the same time for restful experience each out breath.

There's a core relaxation that takes place in the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm muscle.

And that's automatic on every out breath. You don't need to make that happen. You just need to notice that physiologically it has to happen or the out breath won't occur.

So when you breathe out in that local E in the core of your body there's automatic relaxation.

As that's happening if you sort of spread awareness, to all the whole body is also settled the length of 5 lens.

The two arms and 2 legs in the head. So then that's actually an example of zoom in and out on a restful state.

That the rest fullness from the core spreads and effects the whole body, so each out breath just.

Completely inundate you with physical relaxation.

And that's a zoom in out on a restful flavor that's very natural.
