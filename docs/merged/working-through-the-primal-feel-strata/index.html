<p>And I have a hypothesis that when People are noting those emotional feels that in fact, what's happening in the central nervous system? Is activation in? What's called the limbic system and that there is distinct new Ronald apparatus that underlies.</p>
<p>The emotional type sensations in the body and emotional sensations. In the body are hugely important in my way of thinking in terms of their influence on human perception and behavior.</p>
<p>So as People work with this category of the emotional body or feel space as I call it.</p>
<p>You might think well as the result of meditating as the years go on things get sort of mellow mellow doubt cool doubt that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But actually</p>
<p>What happens is typically is that you get strange changes?</p>
<p>That are sort of weird for People.</p>
<p>And they take the form of things that would really, really, really bother anyone.</p>
<p>Like don't bother you.</p>
<p>Or not much.</p>
<p>But the flip side is that little things can cause these huge explosions of somatic emotionality.</p>
<p>An you want it's like what's wrong with me? What's like sort of happening to me.</p>
<p>So what I tell People is if you work with the emotional body. One thing that you can expect is that things will change.</p>
<p>But you can't predict.</p>
<p>What direction that change will take in terms of are things going to be more mellow more intense are the flavors that come up going to be more appropriate or inappropriate they seem to go through wild fluctuations and it's important not to freak out when this happens and wonder what in the world is going on, I would say.</p>
<p>There are some things that we can say our.</p>
<p>Long term trends absolutely definitely long-term trend uncomfortable sensations are going to become less problematic for you.</p>
<p>And absolutely long-term trend.</p>
<p>Pleasant emotional sensations are going to become more fulfilling for you.</p>
<p>However, in terms of local fluctuations don't be surprised if there's some really weird chaotic kinds of things.</p>
<p>What to do if that happens is?</p>
<p>Simply.</p>
<p>Recycle the reactions, the model that I like to use is that?</p>
<p>We have within us this.</p>
<p>Freaked out.</p>
<p>Infant animal.</p>
<p>Deep down within.</p>
<p>As we meditate</p>
<p>We develop another self, which could be called the meditator self or the concentrated clear equanimous self or the witness and at a certain.</p>
<p>Extreme will call that the no self.</p>
<p>Or the higher self.</p>
<p>So what happens is that?</p>
<p>The this super adult part of us shines its attention on the freaked out infantile animal part that remains.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Integrates.</p>
<p>Or we could say even metabolise is or if we wanted to be a little more poetic, we can say eats up.</p>
<p>Literally nibbles away at the freaking.</p>
<p>Animal infant within.</p>
<p>And as this.</p>
<p>Higher self or no self.</p>
<p>Or meditate herself.</p>
<p>As it's sort of like nibbling away at this freaked out infant animal. It's deriving nutrition from that it's growing.</p>
<p>Which is good?</p>
<p>And the freaked out animal infant is shrinking.</p>
<p>Which is also good?</p>
<p>Except.</p>
<p>As it shrinks.</p>
<p>It drops to even more primitive levels.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>And that's why you get this weird sort of like Oh my God. What do I have inside of me kind of thing so it's actually a sign of progress. The surface of freaked out animal infant OK. It's like getting integrated. It's enerji what the energycap bound up in it.</p>
<p>Is going into the Super adult?</p>
<p>That's good, but</p>
<p>You sort of like nibble nibble away a layer.</p>
<p>So it shrinks it smaller in a sense its influence over you is diminished, but it exposes a more primitive stratum.</p>
<p>And so it goes until you sort of.</p>
<p>Work your way through this aspect.</p>
<p>Which might take awhile?</p>
<p>So as you get closer and closer and closer to becoming completely free. You are now exposing more and more and more chaotic intense levels of pure body emotion.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>This model helps me to have a conceptual framework for why it sometimes seems that that tiny is idiosyncracies of a person our sins, crying out to heaven for vengeance or why, why?</p>
<p>Someone can insult me with all kinds of lies on the Internet and I don't even give it a second thought.</p>
<p>But if somebody cuts me off in traffic, it's like this huge you know it's like you know like I'm going to kill around me at all.</p>
<p>So so it's like weird OK.</p>
<p>Up that seems to just be the way it works.</p>
<p>I just wanted to share that for those of you that are wondering if you're on the way to the booby. Hatch now you're on the way to the source.</p>
<p>But as they say membership has its price.</p>
<p>So you're joining the club many, many, many human beings have taken this path so Welcome to the club, but membership has its price.</p>
