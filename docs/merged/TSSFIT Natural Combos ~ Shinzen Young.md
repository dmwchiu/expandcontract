One of the natural ones is 2 + 2 + 2 equals 6.

So 2 for the body to for the mind to for world, so if you want to go body mind world first of all your clumping them. That way and Secondly you're choosing not to make certain distinctions perfectly legit.

This path is about making distinctions and destroying distinctions. I think I say that every day and the trick is just skillfully make distinctions and to skillfully destroy distinct.
