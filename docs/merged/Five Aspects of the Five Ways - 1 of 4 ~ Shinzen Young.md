When I think of each of those five ways. I sort of think of.

Each one is having 5 aspects to it.

If you think about each of the approaches focus in.

Are you working with your subject of experience feel image dog focus out? Where you're working with your object of experienced outside sound focus on rest or you're working with restful states focus on change because I'm positive if you analyze each one you could see how in specific, they develop these 3 core mindfulness skills.

So on one hand, there's sort of like generic exercise equipment and you can use them as you would exercise equipment. If you think of Jim with five workout stations. Each piece of equipment has sort of like different settings, adjust the settings. One way to use. It is to do a set sequence where it's like OK. I do this that. I do this and I always follow that same set sequence so you can do all five ways or just.

A subset of the five ways in a set sequence another way, People use the exercise equipment is well there. Just go to one.

And they'll do a certain setting and that's what they like to do another way that People use the room full of exercise equipment is they'll do 1:00 and then they'll decide I'm going to go over to this other one and they sort of cut in and out. It's considered rude in a public place. But if it's your own set of equipment. You can dupe around and branches. You wish so if you wish to work within the basic mindfulness system. You can either do a set sequence where you can just have a single stand alone.

Practice that you do or you can Lupin branch, depending on interest opportunity necessities or like.

You know start with one and maybe there's a lot of flow. Or maybe there's a lot of pain and so depending on opportunity on one hand or necessity on another hand. It's like an algorithm and you decide so that's sort of one way to look at the each of the five ways generic exercise.

Behavioral challenges are driven by sensory challenges, so sensory challenges are very primary if you're.

In a challenging situation in the first thing you do is you make an analysis of.

What are the components the sensory components in this sensory challenge and you can also use this not just for yourself but if you happen to be in a helping profession and your guiding some other person. You help them make an analysis of what the sensory challenges.

Once you see what the sensory challenges, then you can start to formulate a range of strategies for dealing with it. Fortunately, there's more than one strategy. Typically, an so you can try different ones until you find? What works for example, let's say you have an issue of?

Hey physical pain.

Like last night, I sat for several hours without moving so at some point I started to get a lot of pain.

Clearly part of the sensory challenge is.

The uncomfortable touch of the pain.

It could happen, though, that you have.

Dis concerning mental pictures negative talk.

Fear agitation pour me feel flavors so the sensory challenge could be more than just painted could involve three other factors.

Essentia Lee there are 3 strategies for dealing with any sensory challenge turned towards it.

Turn away from it or focus on how things change things, meaning any and all things including it. The sensory challenge. 'cause focus on changes one of these unifying.

Practice is it's one of the practices that destroys distinctions.

So a person.

Might if they choose to focus on change strategy. Initially, there might, not be any change in the sensory challenge, but there might be some flow in some other part of there being a focus on that and then it starts to move into the sensory challenge.

So you can turn towards.

And then you bring your concentration clarity and equanimity to the sensory challenge.

And that's one way to deal with it. Another way to deal with it is turned away for example, if you have uncomfortable touch and you're having a lot of feeling that stock reactions to it. You could choose to replace those negative feel image talk with positive you'll either be able to do it or not, but that would be to turn away from the sensory challenge focus on positive or you could focus on restful states or you could attempt to focus on.

Sounds say the Sound of Music you're moving the attention away from the sensory challenge now as.

The problem is that People think if you.

Focus away from the sensory challenge, then you're into avoidance denial and suppression.

If you focus on the sensory challenge, you're just going to make it worse.

And the objection to focus on changes it's not changing it will never change. So then you set yourself up for failure right because all possible strategies you have an objection to.

But let's say you had to take an extreme turn away from its strategy. You're in pain. You have a lot of feelings talk reactions, you decide to focus on the Sound of Music.

Are you really suppressing or denying?

If you conceive of it as.

I am wearing.

The touch feel image talk Just Dance it stands do its thing.

But I'm choosing the background, meaning.

Totally give it permission, but I'm not intentionally focusing on it, I am intentionally focusing on the Sound of Music.

You actually having equanimity with the sensory challenge, you're not directing your concentration or clarity towards it.

But you do have equanimity with and that's an important factor.

Your concentration and clarity is directed toward sound. Ann is being strengthened by working against the gravitational tug of the touch feel image talk. You have to bring yourself back to the sound that strengthening your concentration afterward to detect the sound even though all this other stuff is erupting like a pacuvius that Revs up your detection clarity piece so developing mindfulness concentration.

And you're developing equanimity with what's going on even though you're not focusing on it, you can conceive of the Endeavour that way, and at some point.

The sensory challenge make cool out a bit.

And the concentration and clarity that you developed with the sound of the music in output. If you wish to turn that towards the sensory challenge.

And you've got a momentum of it and now you are doing a term Tord strategy.

And yes, it's true. If you focus your attention on a sensory challenge, sometimes it may exacerbate it.

But.

Sometimes, things have to inflate before they're ready to deflate or the bubble has to get big before it's going to pop that goes with the turning Tord strategy.

So we did yasa last night late night sitting so you get sleepy.

So what's the sensory challenge, the sensory challenge is yucky sensations of sleepiness.

Once the behavioral challenge the behavioral challenges keep your spine straight your eyes open and your consciousness awake. That's the behavioral challenge well. There's a relationship between sensory challenges behavioral challenge that turned towards strategy is turned towards the actual sensations of sleepiness infuse them with concentration clarity equanimity until they?

ARP refused an?

Cause you less suffering and at some point probably break up into a flowing enerji that's a term. Tord strategy but you could do a turn away from strategy. You could notice that each wave of sleepiness causes your body to slightly relax. You could notice that as you get sleepy. You can't focus your eyes external vision defocus is causing a restful state of just light coming in your mental screen.

Also, maybe come have a lot of light and so forth those a restful states. So you focus away onto the restful states that are being induced by the sleepiness and do not dealing with the sensory challenge, but you use that to carry you through and as I say at some point you may get an experience of flow and then that's a focus on change strategy.
