Teachers can't avoid making bad karma either. We describe things that could happen and how to work with them, which then will motivate you give you a sense of what to look for and give you a sense of how to work with it if it should occur either. We do that, or we don't we do that. We've done your service and we've done you a disservice because those things may not occur and it sets up all sorts of comparison mind and.

The Medison then becomes the poison there's lots of different ways, you could define enlightenment.

One way that will help you, perhaps be disabused of the comparison mind. I'd like to tell this story. Most of you have heard this story. Many years ago, I and another American Buddhist monk and a Japanese and Roshi. The 3:00 of us were interviewed for Japanese television, the interviewer asked me the question's authority to lie dine on this car.

Now you might know the word Satori. That means enlightenment in Japanese waking up when you get right down to it. What is it like I turned to the other American monk? Who is more senior than myself.

And he sort of turned to the Roshi.

So that got passed onto the Roshi. This is my zoomy. Roshi, who's lineages very prominent in North America. Here you are a roshi.

Presumably you know what it like my dad said, but now it's for the record for the Camera for half a million People that are watching on television forever, you're on the spot.

Satori toy dine on this car when you get right down to it, what is it like?

So.

Migos.

So.

30 to Saturday, then I don't know.

I guess you could say.

It's the disappearance of the distinction between Enlightenment and modded like Monday.





Meaning.

As soon as you start thinking? What am I going to get enlightened. Why is this one more enlightened than me? Why have and I experienced this? What am I doing wrong you are making a distinction between Enlightenment and not in line with the quickest or to enlightenment right then and there.

But you know what it is.

Stop making that distinction if you keep that in mind, then People like me won't make so much bad karma.

By telling you all sorts of distinctions.

As you

Give nature half a chance.

To gradually nurture your concentration clarity and equanimity skills.

Over the weeks months years.

For the duration there is a good probability that at some point.

Those that triple skill set my definition of mindfulness will reach a sufficient critical mass so that if you chose to work with the theme of expansion and contraction in your senses.

If that was something you wanted to do.

Uh.

But that would be available to you if you read the classic text on the posener or mindfulness meditation. the V Suit Di Maka. It means the path of purification. It was written by put to Cosa. I don't know. Maybe in the 5th century AD and Shree Lanca written in the Pali language. There are some translations. It's not an easy read that's for sure.

Even in translation in any event, you will see he describes A.

A point in one's development.

Not very rather close to.

The experience of stream entry or?

Initial insight enlightenment, if you will.

There's a time when your awareness becomes.

Dominated by the pattern of rising and passing rising and passing.

That is to say things well up and then things subside.

At a somewhat later stage.

You be cut your attention becomes dominated by the pattern of no sooner does it start to arise but it's already passing?

As soon as the time space volume that a sensory event would occupiers arising that time space volume is simultaneously collapsing.

In other words.

Simultaneous expansion and contraction.

And then there.

There.

Neutralization.

Into 0.

Is already explicitly described in the pali literature?

I am quite sure Sasaki Roshi never read those passages, he just.

Experienced it in his own practice, but instead of describing it as something over there that you're where things are dying as soon as they are passing.

Which is sort of like linear OK or 2 dimensional?

He sets it up in this 3 dimensional paradigm.

Where?

You're not observing the simultaneous.

Welling the simultaneous birth and death of space, you're not observing it that would put you in some space over here fixated.

You're not observing it fixated The Observer is arising in the sphere itself.

That just means feel image talk and touch the and the world. Your body mind and your sight sound. If you want to cut it up that way body myself and the sight sound world.

There they are arising.

Both inside that time space volume that that is molding them.

Through expansion and contraction.



That means that.

Uh.

As you bop around in the world as you look here, you look there.

You are participating in.

The activity of impermanence you're participating in the source you're not observing the source participating in the source.

And maybe that's one of the different one of the differences between Zen training and Vipasa 9. Pipasa not you sort of observe impermanence and then if you do that long enough. It starts to inform the way your body moves and you ride on impermanence in then they long before you ever actually see impermanence. You're forced lifestyle and the koans and whatever you're forced to ride on impermanence and then eventually you see impermanence.

But in the end, you want to come to both you want to be able to see impermanence and to manifest impermanence to ride on impermanence.

And.

When you when that happens if you if you wish to use this paradigm.

Um.

The.

The source and the products of the source.

Sources the activity of 0 that polarizes and neutralizes the products of the source are the moment by moment self and world as it arises in sensory experience, I don't know what the self in the world are in any other sense, but feel image talk subjective system and sight sound object if.

They are a rising moment by moment in between expansion and contraction.

Therefore, they are not fundamentally separate from the source.

The products of the source and the source are not fundamentally separate so.

As you're going around having ordinary sensory experiences.

There is this sense that.



You're not.

Uh.

There's not a tunas between the source of creation and creation.
