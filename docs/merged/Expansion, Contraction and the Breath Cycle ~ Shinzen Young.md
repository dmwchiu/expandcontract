One has to.

Really detect expensive contractive movement force. It's not just OK if you focus on the breath. That's expansion and contraction. You have to detect those flavors in it, and I wouldn't want to only do it with the breath forever because the idea is you want to eventually be able to detect this in all sensory experiences all time, but the breath is a represent a representative of this.

There's three ways you can do it, you can just focus on the volume metric expansion on the in and the volume metric collapse on the out breath.

So that would be one way you're alternating expansion contraction in the sense of literally space getting larger or smaller.

You can reverse it, though.

When you breathe in the muscles.

Contract and the linings of the bronchi and so forth sort of get field a tug inward, so remember I always say.



Ink pressure or space or etc, etc or force right. So when you breathe in. There's actually a contractive force. That's detectable and when you breathe out that releases so there's an expensive force so that reverses the opposite polarity of the volumetric expansion and contraction. So one way you can work with breath expensive contractive. Wise is in breath is volumetric expansion out breath is volumetric contraction.

Volume metric pardon my keys. It just means with respect to how big something is how you would measure the volume so you can expand on the end contract on the out or force. Wise you can contract on the end.

And expand on the out or if you want to get fancy you can volumetrically expand annefors. Wise contract on the end and reverse that on the out. So you have a both on the end, both on the out. But.

The roles of father and mother get reversed and secure Oh, she says.

When father finds Mother's native village and mother finds father's native village, then father turns into mother and mother turns into father OK. They flip roles and that's the only way that they can come back, etc, etc. So where you've got whichever one you want to call the native village. But there's if you want to call the volume metric thing sort of like surface and then the other thing deep right.

So you, your surface expands on the in breath. The depths contract on the in breath, but then on the out breath. They flip roles right the surface contracts, but the out the inside the muscle stretch so that's probably part of what he's talking about, but just a very small part.

What I find is that by working with the breath that way which is readily available anybody can get almost anyone can get the volumetric expansion contraction. Most People can detect the muscles doing the opposite. I find that working that way. With the breath sort of Sensitizes to the detection of similar.

Phenomena in other sensory domains.
