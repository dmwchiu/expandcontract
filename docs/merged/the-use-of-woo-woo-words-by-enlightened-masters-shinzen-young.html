<p>They can help and they can really get.</p>
<p>So I don't know sometimes I get a little cynical and think the Wu words are used to drawing students will keep paying their dues.</p>
<p>Well, I suspect that there are there's a range of motivations.</p>
<p>Among teachers.</p>
<p>Give me some inside information on teachers OK.</p>
<p>Teachers have a range of motivations and yeah, sometimes it's.</p>
<p>To make sure the Donna stream is intended and but I used to be extremely cynical an rude about all of this stuff when I started 'cause I basically.</p>
<p>You know, I just thought it was BS. You know early very early on when I was a kid and I was just studying this stuff. It was cool to read about and I liked it and I like the Asian languages. But I really thought that it was all made up by them by the monks in order to deceive the faithful. I mean, I really thought that.</p>
<p>And when I went to Asia and I've heard great Masters speak. I'm not I was privileged. I actually like heard People like Yamada Moon Shibayama Zenki. Maybe these names, don't mean much to you. But these are the gods of mid 20th century. Japanese then and there were still alive when I was there both of them.</p>
<p>And I and I could speak not just add Japanese I. I actually heard these People give talks.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>I when I didn't think they were making it up in order to like increase the temple revenue.</p>
<p>But what I did think is that they were making it up to blow people's minds to like save really weird stuff, it's like it's sort of grabbed you and so I thought it was like a Zen affectation like an affected style of presenting things.</p>
<p>Hum that is just basically it's like you know blow people's minds and get peoples attention whatever.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Now I hear myself, saying this.</p>
<p>I mean, I realize Oh my God, I mean, now I know for sure.</p>
<p>What the motivation in those cases was I can say about the kids the high school kids you know at the gate of the temple that are trying to you know get your your shekels OK.</p>
