<p>Consisting of concentration power sensory clarity and equanimity so to the extent that I am a quote meditation teacher. I teach concentration power because that's universal to any form of meditation to the extent that I am a mindfulness teacher. I also emphasized the sensory clarity and the equanimity.</p>
<p>Then there is the extent to which I sort of have my own distinctive way of going about mindfulness and that is definitely has certain distinctive characteristics.</p>
<p>A lot of it goes to my background, I have a pretty solid.</p>
<p>Amateur knowledge of science.</p>
<p>And Mathematics and that has informed the way that I teach mindfulness in a very, very deep way well. One of the things that you learn if you get into the physical Sciences or mathematics at any kind of depth.</p>
<p>Is you learn habits of precision in expression and thinking habit of precision that's correct In other words in ordinary colloquial English.</p>
<p>Force impulse enerji potential momentum action and so forth.</p>
<p>Then they all sort of sound like the same thing and we might use them interchangeably on occasion. But in physics each one of those words that I mentioned means something completely different and distinct each one is defined very, very carefully and in many cases, it took centuries.</p>
<p>For those for that precision of language to be honed and perfected for example, in the area of mathematics. If you take a beginning calculus. Class you learn the definition of something called the derivative of a function.</p>
<p>And you took that I did I.</p>
<p>I remember those words you may remember some maybe remember mother function, but I can't remember well. You may remember an expression along the lines of for any Epsilon. However, small small there is a Delta such that if Delta the absolute value of etc, etc. Etc well anyway. That's the definition. That's part of the definition of the limit of ratio that's used to.</p>
<p>To find the derivative in any event.</p>
<p>It's defined with this incredibly subtle an incredibly complicated and you have to read it over and over and over and over again until it finally sort of registers and then after you read it. About 100 times. It's like Oh of course, so natural. It's so obvious.</p>
<p>Now, what they don't tell you in your beginning calculus book and what would have helped me a lot if they had told me was that that definition of the derivative was not the one that Newton, who invented calculus used?</p>
<p>That was the result of generation upon generation.</p>
<p>Uh a good seventeen 1819. Yeah, like a good 250 years after Newton of the finest mathematical minds.</p>
<p>Euler Gauss Koshy Fire Staas.</p>
<p>I know most People have never heard of these People. But there among the mathematical geniuses of the Western world. Each one of them contributed. Something to that definition that the others hadn't seen.</p>
<p>That's that is the.</p>
<p>The distillation of 300 years of contention discussion and thinking things over.</p>
<p>The end result of which is this.</p>
<p>Incredibly precise incredibly powerful concept.</p>
<p>Well, you get used to dealing with that level of precision and you get used to the notion that you're going to have to.</p>
<p>Really think about the definitions and read and Reread and Reread Because.</p>
<p>It's worth it.</p>
<p>Because.</p>
<p>An ordinary high school student who is willing to come back over and over and over again will be able to understand this as well as those better than those mathematical geniuses because there's stored wisdom? Is there I like to think of myself as.</p>
<p>On a mission to take the missed out of mysticism.</p>
<p>I think it can be done, yeah, it can using mysticism. Not in the sense of New Age Airy fairy. But in the sense of classical mystical experience as exists inside the great traditions of the world.</p>
<p>Essentia Lee contemplative experience, I'm academically. I said that I haven't good amateurs knowledge of Science and math.</p>
<p>But I have a professional academic trained knowledge of comparative mysticism, and Asian languages and Buddhist studies. And so forth that was my degree in Graduate School my degree program so I sort of bring a very strong scholarship background because of knowing most of the Asian languages in which the technologies internal exploration of the E are encoded then I have this.</p>
<p>Scientific thing, which causes me to be extremely precise about how I define terms. People that work with me have to be willing to put up with that, but it saves them. A lot of time in the end. Well, they're able to eventually communicate and conceptualize the entire path to classical enlightenment.</p>
<p>Precisely, in words.</p>
<p>That's taking the missed out of mysticism. So you ask me what's distinctive I bring the Scholastic background.</p>
<p>I bring a science background.</p>
<p>And that informs the whole way that I teach and then.</p>
<p>I'd</p>
<p>Because I have this sort of Broadview of world meditative practice, I've created a system that is.</p>
<p>How can I say?</p>
<p>It is a framework.</p>
<p>Within which all of the major innovations. In historical innovations in contemplative technologies from the past. All of those major innovations can be formulated within the framework that I've created.</p>
<p>I call it 5 ways to know yourself as a spiritual being each one of those five ways represents a distinct innovation. That happened in history. But I've reformulated it into modern secular language. An placed it all on universal framework within the mindfulness tradition.</p>
