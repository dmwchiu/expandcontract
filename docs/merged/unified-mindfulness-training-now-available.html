I am extremely excited today because it is the official launch day of the foundations program. We are rolling and I couldn't be more excited about it for a couple of reasons. I know that there is really nothing like this out there right now and I know that for 2. Reasons number one shins ends framework. The depth of it, the scope of it the clarity.</p>
<p>The precision the thoroughness, he has taking has done the work for all of us, both in terms of having a breath of experience in his own training being familiar with so many different contemplative approach is being having a scholarly approach so understanding world contemplative practices on that level having a scientifiche rigor because he partners with.</p>
<p>You know hard science to do research around practice, so that gives us a tremendous framework to lean on and it makes our job as trainers, so much easier so there's that, but then there's also the fact that and maybe actually this is connected. There's the fact that in this space right now. You either have to take a deep dive into practice go whole hog and get certified and.</p>
<p>You know spend years in training and years in the certification process, which is totally amazing and honorable. But the flip side of that? Is there really isn't anything other than that track so anybody who is in a helping profession and would maybe like to for example, a psychotherapist offering it as a complementary practice for their patients not their main thing. But something they'd like to share because they think it would be useful.</p>
<p>So anyone basically who is in a helping profession or in a position to share it who would like to their on their own. You don't really have any kind of framework to lean on you have to just kind of watch. Other teachers do it and gather from that how to do it yourself. There isn't anything out there right now that speaks to you if you are either kind of less experienced or you want to you're going to helping profession and you want to offer it just as part of what you do.</p>
<p>Or even if you're more experienced but you don't necessarily want to take a deep dive into full on certification program so I'm excited because this offers you a framework so that you can get the support you need in offering other People. This training so Lastly. It helps you go deeper with your own practice because you bring that level of clarity. Then, in order to be able to tell someone else about it, you really have to know.</p>
<p>What's going on inside you as you do your practice so very powerful on all those levels. Very happy that we've made this available and today is the opening day so check it out.
