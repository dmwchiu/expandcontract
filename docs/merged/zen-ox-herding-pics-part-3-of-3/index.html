<p>These are all have their validity so in the beginning, there could be many.</p>
<p>Causes for us to take on this practice.</p>
<p>But the final cause the RAT what's when you get right down to it? What is it going to be about?</p>
<p>This is my favorite and the last.</p>
<p>Essentia Lee, the Chinese version of Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Roly Poly Guy, the bag full of goodies.</p>
<p>Going into the marketplace handed him out.</p>
<p>There anyone who wants to take him.</p>
<p>Very ordinary OK.</p>
<p>The kind of person you wouldn't hesitate to talk to.</p>
<p>The kind of person you might not think.</p>
<p>Even.</p>
<p>Was in any way special unless you knew what to look for?</p>
<p>This is actually a historical character.</p>
<p>Someone that existed in Chinese history.</p>
<p>He was known as the cloth bag monk.</p>
<p>And that's essentially what he was a bag man, a street person in the capital of China.</p>
<p>During the Tang Dynasty in China, there was this well known sort of St person.</p>
<p>That was a kind of Buddhist monk.</p>
<p>But all he did was play with children all day.</p>
<p>And just hang out in the market Payson schmooze with People.</p>
<p>And everybody knew him and he was just sort of this like friendly guy and.</p>
<p>You know easy to get along with you never really think there was anything all that special.</p>
<p>But it was always just sort of around for People.</p>
<p>Particularly, like to give out.</p>
<p>Gifts to children things like that, and at night, he used to sleep in the snow.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>That should have been a giveaway right there that there was something.</p>
<p>A little unusual about his Physiology that may have been the result of.</p>
<p>Of something he was known to the citizens of chang'an, and they called him the boot. I harsh on booming's cloth. Diamonds bag and Hushang means among the cough bag Monk 'cause. He carried around these gifts to give to People.</p>
<p>The Emperor of China at that time was a Buddhist and meditator.</p>
<p>Who had his own Imperial preceptor his own sort of master right would have been like the most authoritative?</p>
<p>Monk in China of the time they call that the gouache are that's the the teacher of the emperor so one morning, the gotur.</p>
<p>Said your Majesty.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>If you're aware or not, but the most enlightened.</p>
<p>Subject in your Kingdom died this morning.</p>
<p>And the Emperor said, who</p>
<p>And the Imperial Master said.</p>
<p>The cloth bag monk.</p>
<p>The Emperor couldn't believe it.</p>
<p>Brazil's like that was the most enlightened person.</p>
<p>In my Kingdom.</p>
<p>'Cause everybody just took him for granted.</p>
<p>So this becomes.</p>
<p>A sort of ideal for what an enlightened person should be like.</p>
<p>Very.</p>
<p>Ordinary very easily approachable just there therefore you.</p>
<p>Nothing all that special in the Indic Formulation.</p>
<p>Unenlightened.</p>
<p>Being is a God.</p>
<p>Is an archetype?</p>
<p>But in the Chinese formulation.</p>
<p>The enlightened being is.</p>
<p>A sort of.</p>
<p>Pudgy.</p>
<p>Easily approach.</p>
<p>Guy hanging out in the streets.</p>
<p>Available to People.</p>
<p>Uh but with these gifts to give.</p>
<p>So this is called?</p>
<p>This last picture is called entering the marketplace with hand outstretched.</p>
<p>We may start this path for various reasons.</p>
<p>But if we stay on it.</p>
<p>In the end.</p>
<p>This is where we end up.</p>
<p>We end up with what's called the Dow Shin in Chinese, the Bodhichitta.</p>
<p>The intense.</p>
<p>Call to be of service to our fellow being in one way beings.</p>
<p>In one way or another.</p>
<p>It's an automatic consequense of.</p>
<p>Having.</p>
<p>Understood the nature of consciousness, the nature of.</p>
<p>My mind.</p>
<p>Which is the nature of nature the nature of the source it's an automatic consequense of?</p>
<p>Knowing that your source is everyone source, but knowing that for real not in a sort of.</p>
<p>Feel good belief kind of way. But in a very tangible way moment by moment really inescapable in your moment by moment perceptions of things.</p>
<p>We're going to be going into the marketplace.</p>
<p>When we leave here.</p>
<p>Metaphorically.</p>
<p>We have a bag full of goodies.</p>
<p>And we can go with hand outstretched. Not that we're going to lay any trips on anybody.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>You have a gift to give.</p>
<p>The gift of the effects of your practice.</p>
<p>You may never speak about it explicitly but your pores will.</p>
<p>The pores of your skin that's teaching.</p>
<p>That's going into the marketplace, giving a gift to People.</p>
<p>If somebody asks you what you did, in your capable of giving.</p>
<p>A reasonable logical code coherent description of this practice.</p>
<p>You're giving a gift.</p>
<p>To someone.</p>
<p>And some of you.</p>
<p>Already and many of you eventually will discover that.</p>
<p>You will end up actually teaching maybe 1 or 2 People. Or maybe more People, you may have heard the.</p>
<p>The cliche when the students ready the teacher appears.</p>
<p>Well, I don't know about that, but I can definitely tell you that when the teachers ready, the students appear.</p>
<p>And you may notice that happening.</p>
<p>To you.</p>
<p>Do not be alarmed.</p>
<p>And understand that in the end.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>This is the.</p>
<p>The final goal of this practice.</p>
