<p>Specifically, People bearing guru coffee.</p>
<p>The Guru Coffee delivery.</p>
<p>The wisdom water.</p>
<p>Yes, now.</p>
<p>The project begins to flow.</p>
<p>You know, I don't normally talk like this shins in but when I hear you do something like this. I gotta say you're a ******* genius.</p>
<p>Party pardon the French yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, there. There are times when darn just isn't enough.</p>
<p>It's like when you hit your thumb with a hammer you know, saying Oh.</p>
<p>Well, now, I've got local global of pleasant self preferential aprobacion flavors so.</p>
<p>I thank you for that and I can get the spread. I'm getting on zooming in and out. The primary is here, but it's down there there in there, too.</p>
<p>OK, now I'm going to get to use a real real equord in face single person in this room knows what this word means I am going to be immensely surprised.</p>
<p>Now you're always there.</p>
<p>Now mind you there are approximately 1/2 million words.</p>
<p>Not 1/4 quarter, no about 1/2 point, yeah about 1/2 million words.</p>
<p>The word doesn't pop up into my talk space lists and Cephalic SILISSENCEPHALIC.</p>
<p>Our brains got too big for our skulls, so they developed convolutions so we have these.</p>
<p>These gyrion salicide.</p>
<p>But if you look at a rat brain.</p>
<p>Flat.</p>
<p>It's through the surface is smooth, so non convoluted brain type.</p>
<p>I've called this in cephalic.</p>
<p>So why is this related to anything?</p>
<p>Well, the problem is the convolutions obscured the organization of the brain that's like especially in a human brain.</p>
<p>So they have what they call it exploded brains that a computer could do where it makes it into a giant ball. So then it makes you see how it's really organized. It's more intuitive but you don't need that with a rat brain. It's already that way. And if you look at the mapping of the processing areas in a rats brain.</p>
<p>Here's the part that does the body here's the part that does the auditory there's the part that does the visual?</p>
<p>I suggested that we do as a practice at life focus on positive.</p>
<p>You know during this 10 minutes that we've been not talking.</p>
<p>Since I suggested doing it.</p>
<p>To you folks that means of course, I have to do it.</p>
<p>I got this immediate incredibly subtle hit.</p>
<p>Of fear and sadness.</p>
<p>So if you decide to have a positive social emotion with actual other humans.</p>
<p>Don't be surprised if it may resonate with the other emotion.</p>
<p>For no reason what's the weather ever. Other then suddenly had the temerity to work with field space in front of a group of People.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah from myself just Oh my God. I'm going to have to like be in pot. It's not like I don't do it, OK, but it's like now. I have to do it and they're going to do it and there was like this fear, which I can understand.</p>
<p>But why the tear.</p>
<p>And I don't need to know because I spotted it and I quantum ized it.</p>
