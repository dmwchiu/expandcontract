So.

Apropos of sharing my stories in my practice, so you sort of got the impression that I was fairly majorly.

Bummed out by my travel fiasco.

So how did I deal with it?

Practice Wise.

Well.

One thing is the obvious when when things would come up, I did use the focus turned Tech.

I tend to use that when I'm.

Upset.

For the obvious reasons inevitably the self returns right so.

There's 2 freedoms from the self well there's a lot of freedoms from self.

Many faceted.

Many many ways actually but the 2:00 that I like to mostly think about is well there's the experience of.

Quote all rest the non arising of seeing hearing feeling that actually happens.

Much more frequently than People realize one of the reasons that by give you these categories.

Is so that you can start to notice that effect you already are in mind at least microscopically?

Because if you really pay close attention to the inner activation system. You'll see that there are all rest moments and that's a relative no self experience. It may not be clear, an intense enough to cause a stream entry or permanent change, but that is a relative moment of no cell.

Now, if you happen to catch an intense arising of all 3:00 at the very beginning and you completely quantum eyes, it and you catch the moment when all three vanish and subjective space itself collapses to go then actually you will have a stream entry experience.

That's why Sasaki well, she seems like he's very mean because.

He describes how the self arises and passes.

And then he makes damn sure that that's going to happen for you. Bye.

Saying things about you in public and you know, there's no censoring and there's no.

Mercy in that regard.

Um because he's just playing a numbers game.

Hoping.

If he's got enough students here in America.

And does makes People intensely self conscious in front all their friends enough times, someone's going to have what it takes.

To have to actually keep the practice going while that's happening rather than get into the he said she said, You know FU so anyway.

So one form of Freedom is well it doesn't arise and you actually notice that.

Um.

Another form of this also is.

Part of the coin system that uses so 1st. It's like OK, when you see the flower. How do you become free from yourself? He wants see out without any see in here in Florida at all?

And he wants to see out it's even itself to be flown ago.

But then the next question is going to be or not the next but another one somewhere down the line is OK. Good you wonderful you achieve oneness with flower now? How do you separate from flow so you're smiling 'cause actually had this column? How do you separate from flower?

What does that mean?

How does it mean make an object out of the flower were not in the normal sense because the goal is to not need to do that.

But what it means is.

That.

The judging self does arise.

However, it arises as.

A nun fixated flow.

It is completely equalized so that even though it is a self. Asthana rising it is not a self as a thing.

And so you've returned to yourself, but it's not really the self so my.

Language in for this is so well, I'll tell you another story the.



Ah.

I was privileged many years ago to live in the same vihar out the same. Tera Vaada Buddhist monastery as an and the Maitreya on the Maitreya was sort of the Sasaki Roshi of terrabona booties of in some ways, he was the Grand Old man was in his 90s.

From Sri Lanka and.

I remember seeing him so much younger person in a BBC documentary.

Called the longest journey it's a documentary when they went around the world and interviewed spiritual leaders.

And they interviewed him and they said well could you summarize in a few sentances Buddhism?

And you said Well, you can actually summarize it in a few words.

No self no problem. You might have heard that OK as far as I know he's the person that originative that.

However, I have my little console my version of that.

Which so no self no problem? Yeah, the non arising of the self?

No problem.

But also

No self no problem.

Flow self no problem. You follow the self realized perhaps with a vengeance, perhaps firing on all three cylinders.

See you in your own field.

But.

It's a flow so it is a self.

It.

And flow and filled the room with its doing.

It's a room sized personality, which is the diametric opposite of a room sized ego.



So yeah, I sort of used focus in.

I'm yeah, little bit uh sort of process.

But I also did something else.

Which was more in the line of nurture positive cognition?

Uh a certain entertaining of certain thought pattern.

Um.

I think in psychology this is sometimes referred to as an explanatory mechanism.

It's like OK.

Do do happened now? How do you think about you think about this like OK this do to always happens to me or the world is?

Appeared of do, do or why am I attracting this do to myself or well do, do happens.

I am I right side psychology. I think someone, saying yes that there's the term explanatory style or explanatory mechanisms like? How do you use talkspace to deal with stuff?

Um so.

What I use is pro teacher summit product?

But it's actually it's only very minorly and talk space actually.

Not surprisingly incident unit space and I've noticed over the years that this sort of image based cognitive re framing.

Uh is coming easier and easier and easier, more and more naturally.

And I think it has something to do with the whole sensitizing within the visual field that I described to you then is such a major element in my practice.

So.

What I think is I'm putting it into words but as I say I'm more see it then think it in words. But it's like OK well. Yeah, it's in words too. That's true now that I'm saying it, it's like.

OK, I've been doing this stuff for 40 years.

And.

I always make retreat sometime because I believe that the early and if there is a problem. You know, then they get me there at least by the next day.

And then I'm thinking OK well.

There's really been a deterioration in the hole.

Travel experience.

There's

The tension in the airport around the security and I'm going to make your flight and and then a lot of the flights get cancelled and.

So.

What's

Weather behind this.

OK, why, why is their business deterioration well responding many factors.

Oh, and I'm not exactly an economist or very sadly in the political field.

But what comes up to my mind is well this is at least partially a consequence of 911.

An then.

I ask myself what was behind nine one.

Well.

Lots of stuff.

Part of it is.

US policies in the Middle East.

And what's behind that you all know I love Israel OK. I go there whenever but

Well, this is I don't talk about this stuff OK because it's not my area of expertise. I know what it means to know a subject really well.

And one of the great things about knowing a subject really well and by the way the subject is sensory reality.

One of the great things most People don't have something that they know really well like.

As well as anyone in the world.

But I'll tell you one of the great things about that is, it leads to a huge sense of humility.

Because you know what it means to know something really well.

And when I think about all the other things that I would like to Pontific 8:00 AM.

Like relative to knowing something really well like what do I know about politics and economics of national policies and how stuff should be run by governments?

Come.

You know, I know I can imagine what it would be like to really know that, well but like forget about it. I mean, not even remotely so that could lead to assert.

Refreshing humility to realize that that sort of Militates against the tendency to just want to Pontific 8.

On every topic you know it comes up like I see People.

In my health club doing about politics. Oh my God, after the election. It was bloody if you were rooting for the other guy, you were hurting and there aren't many people in Vermont that were rooting for the other guy.



So anyway, so let's not go there as far as but the fact is that.

And what's behind that.

Well, the Holocaust and what's behind that.

Well, the way Germany was treated after World War One.

Which was very abusive?

I mean, if you look at the history?

Of.

Oh my God, senior moment.





What's the?

Star Trek now, what was right after World War One verse. I yeah, if you look at what happened in for side. If you look at the memoirs of some of those People. They knew that they had sown the seeds for a little more, they just knew it, but they couldn't help doing it. They just couldn't stop it because they?

Oh, they just wanted to beat up Germany get even.

So.

And what's behind that well all this **** in the 19th century in Europe.

You know what the French did when they invaded Germany OK.

Wasn't pretty?

Etc etc, etc and you get this sense that there's no one to blame and everyone's to play.

It just

I just put that behind behind behind.

And that means what?

But the world sucks that's not how I remember I said that in this causality, but it also means connection.

So the so the inconvenience that I go to go through and when I have to travel now.

That's my direct direct.

Touching of all of the above.



And it's part of.

The vastness of my true being.

And that's that.
