I mentioned in a previous segment that the terms witness consciousness and non dual awareness are used in different ways by different People so this can lead to confusion and even unnecessary contention.

And I talked a little bit about how the term witness or witness consciousness is used.

Now I'd like to say a little bit about nondual.

This is once again, possibly an ambiguous phrase one might say that a non dual awareness is an experience of the Oneness of subject and object from that perspective. Actually, there are a number of ways that non dual awareness can occur. One of them is that there's a touch or a site or a sound that arises and there's no feel or?

Image or talk reaction to it, so there's just that touch or that site or that sound without a sense of an observer separate from it. And so there's an experience of being that touch or that site or that sound in the yoga sutras that's referred to as?

Sabi just Samadi.

Merge somebody in the sense of merging but there's a seed there Savija, the seed is that there's a thing merged with.

A deeper experience of.

Oneness with some People might call non dual awareness.

Occurs when not only does the field image talk?

Reaction.

Not arise.

But the touch sight sound itself.

Arises but it never fixates it just becomes a flow.

And if any feel image talk arises.

All it also is just a flow and the 2:00 flows merge and become a single wave.

And then that wave dies down into nothing into 0.

The touch sight sound world in the field image talk self.

Arise as an interacting wave on fixated.

In between expansion and contraction. They just sort of vibrate and Interpenetrate and then when they die away in that nothingness is the Oneness of subject and object or the true observer.

From a certain perspective.

So some People might call that non dual awareness because there's not in an absolute sense subject and object have been transcended.

Potentially calls at near be just some anti or merging without an object that is merged with another words of formless merging.

In some Zen lineages. It's called Rio more DO means both and more means disappeared will subject and object of disappeared into.

The one

Nothing.

However, personally I would prefer to use the phrase Nondual awareness, to refer to something else.

Something.

More.

Ambitious.

Then.

The things I've just described which are already very ambitious just to have the experience of just hearing or just seeing that takes quite a bit of training typically to have the experience of formless merging near BJ's Samonte audit training. What's more ambitious than that, well, What's more ambitious than that, and what I would.

Personally.

Like to use the word non dual awareness for.

Is?

The.

Habitual.

Abiding.

In.

The cycle.

Of.

0.

Polarization zero polarization over and over and over again, so that sounds very abstract. What do I mean by that.

OK, so let's say that you have that experience or not exactly you have that experience there is the experience of.

Both disappearing into 0, both the object of world and the reactive.

World of thought and feeling.

They've become a wave and that those 2 waves of merged and they flat and into a oneness that is a nothingness.

And you are that nothingness that is the true self, AKA the no self.

What's next will that nothingness is going to break apart?

At once again polarize.

And in the cleft.

Self and world will regenerate.

When the self and world reappear.

If you realize where they've just come from.

Then the self and world are not fundamentally separate from that 0.

Their arising innocence inside 0.

And there is very quickly return to 0 and then the next arising arises sort of inside zero and there's a return to 0, so that you go through your day. Hundreds and hundreds of times a day, having an experience of touching the timeless the 0.

And then

Time being bored, but not really the fundamentally separate the umbilical cord that connects to the 0 is not completely severed. So you're born but not really born and your world comes into existence, but not really because it's still in folded in the 2 sides of zero and so you come in the words of the Neo Platonist.

Philosophers of Western Antiquity.

You come from the good.

Return to the good without ever really leaving the good in any fundamental sense.

Then this is non dual in the sense that there's not a separation.

Between.

Source and and the daily life that's born from source so you're just bopping around in the world doing what anybody does, but you end your world are born but not really born so there's not a.

A fundamental cleft from a practical point of view between the transcendent and the ordinary.

And so there is not that's the real non duality as I would have it creator and creation that duality has been seen through so a person that in terms of Zen Oxherding Pictures that somebody that is firmly mounted on the ox can never be bucked off the ox. No matter what life throws at them, so you're writing this.

Powerful ox called consciousness or emptiness or source or God or nature and you can't be bucked off.

Buy whatever wells up from the inside or hits, you from the outside you're still never fundamentally separate from.

Nothing I would use the term nondual awareness for that.
