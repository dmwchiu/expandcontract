Sometimes People say a ships and you've got a label from the moment of vanishing gone.

What's wrong? Why don't you have the label for the moment of arising?

I do.

I absolutely have a label for the moment of arising.

That we use.

Ann.

When we do.

The expensive contraction flow.

The moment of a rising at a very deep deep level of understanding.

The moment of a rising is the moment when the space of that experience simultaneously is comes into existence and begins coming out of it going out of existence right label for that is both.

Both expansion and contraction. They've pulled apart and they are molding. The present moment. Both saw both car. Both got both gone. You sum up all those posts and Ganz.

And you have a giant eternal fountain of youth.

That is always simultaneously spreading and collapsing at pervaded with the absolute tranquility of a trillion fashions.

To the extent that you have become that that there's been a figure ground reversal.

That instead of thinking about that or observing that you actually participate in that well. That's an eternal fountain of youth so to that extent.

You become that and



Your personal death.

Is much less of an issue?

Because.

Writing personal that thing being the death of a mind and body.

But to the extent that you re identified with the flow of the source.

That's not going to go away.

So quote you will never go to that extent.

And to the extent that there's been a figure ground reversal.

And instead of observing bomb.



He.

There's just called?

And.

Things come and go from it.

Well to that extent, you won't actually notice the difference between being alive and being dead.

Out as strange as that sounds.

That means that you won't have to die.

Your body mind wife pass away.

But you won't have to die.
