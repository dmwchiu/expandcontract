And this for me that Rick would be like with like most of the time you know the problem is.

Lack of sensory clarity, so most of the time with practices separating.

But there are those huge windows that opened.

Where the practice is unified and that's the dialectic of this practice, it's about that's one of the balance aspects.

The.

It's a dynamic back.

OK, there's a place there's a whole list of empowering distinctions.

And there's a whole list of empowering unification.

And there's a whole list of disempowering distinctions and there are even disempowering unifications totally get that. You got your moneys worth yeah? What's an example of a disempowered? What's what are some examples of disempowering unifications.



Say what



Coda Enmeshment.

Uh.

Week eagle structure where they got borderline issues.

Uh and

Last but not least identification with the aggressor Patty Hearst syndrome.

So there's this whole list of Disempowering Unifications.

But there's also the flip side of all of the above.

Is empowering antifa?

And then there's disempowering distinctions of which the main one is.



My identity stops with my skin.

That's the that's the biggest disempowering distinction.

Distinction between inside and outside and then the distinction between material and spiritual between form and emptiness.

Those are all disempowering.

Distinctions so the name of the game is or the bad news is.

That.

Most human beings are involved in disempowering distinctions and disempowering unification.

The good news is that any human being who chooses to can flip it.

And with a lot of study and practice come too.

Understand empowering distinctions an empowering unifications.

So the focus in technique is interesting for example.

I usually present it to you as a deconstructive technique, but it's actually also a restorative technique.

People that have a?

Are these?

Sometimes it's called borderline or you know.

Boundary problem in the sense that they can't remember who they are when they're in the presence of the looming other.

OK, there's this.

Diagnosis right and I've had People that had like official psychiatric diagnosis.

All of that week ego structure thing and the description that they gave and the description from the diagnostic and statistical manual was in the prop presence of other People. The looming other, they just can't keep contact with who they are.

Well guess Wat the focus in technique will allow you to do that.

And that's what I used actually use this woman had had a lifelong big-time diagnosis.

You know from a professional psychiatry.

And what I did is I just had a poodle just a little different spin on the focus in.

Instead of using it to untangle the IMF.

I had to use it to keep in contact with the fact that she does have an internal life. Even in the presence of the looming other.

And it's very tangible and the clarity allowed her to know she had mental image. Mental talk and emotional body sensations. Even when the looming other was present in the looming other was any other human.

When it started and so that's the sensory clarity. What's the concentration piece is to not lose contact with that content.

In the presence of the looming others just training.

Just training.

So.

That's now using the focus in which in some ways could be thought of as breaking down the small self.

But just put a little different spin on it, it's actually empowering the ability to not lose yourself. When you need to have a distinction between inside and outside so you've probably heard this expression.

Call you have to have an ego before you could let go of the ego, etc, etc. Well I'm not sure that I would exactly formulate it that way. But I would say that there is a dialectical process.

Ah and

I drew a picture OK.

So anyway.

You you know who first came up with that expression about you have to have an ego before you can let go of it.

That was Jack Angler, who is both a mindfulness teacher and A at one time was the head of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, which tells us something about the age and Country Living.

Uh so I told Jack.

This story about the woman with the.

Whatever and he actually immediately invited me to do grand rounds at Harvard Medical School based on that whole.

Paradigm.

I ended up wasn't able to go, but you know historically interesting.
