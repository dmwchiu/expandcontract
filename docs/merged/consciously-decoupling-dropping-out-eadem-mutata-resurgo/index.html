<p>Things like touch sight sound that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Working in the in the object of spaces.</p>
<p>You might say Well, like site and touch if your eyes are open site in touch are always there. I mean, obviously right your physical body is always there, the world's always there.</p>
<p>But what can happen is that you, you can disconnect that's just be couple is just my geek way of saying disconnect.</p>
<p>That can be a if you're let's say you're working in these site type system.</p>
<p>It's possible that you could for a moment disk disconnect from that system.</p>
<p>Either because you're</p>
<p>About to go into reverie.</p>
<p>Or you're getting sleepy.</p>
<p>So for so that disconnect.</p>
<p>Actually, causes a</p>
<p>And it's a restful state.</p>
<p>You're not looking at things.</p>
<p>No, you are sleepy open and you're all those sensation maybe arising in your body your.</p>
<p>Attention is going elsewhere.</p>
<p>So all you could feel that it's there.</p>
<p>OK, so it causes a restful state to rise for a moment and that's your tell you understanding poker you know what to tell is it's a giveaway.</p>
<p>So you know what's going on?</p>
<p>Buy some.</p>
<p>External sign.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I want to train People to detect the moment when they're being pulled away from their object of meditation.</p>
<p>The way you detect that is by noticing that.</p>
<p>For just a brief moment.</p>
<p>Where you have been focusing on active states it's not gone restful because you disconnected and I sometimes?</p>
<p>Sort of obscurely call that deep coupling because it's like in fit in like a magnetic fields. You know there will be a coupling and then they they just disconnect one of its own flux lines D couple.</p>
<p>And you notice that and then you come back to whatever your object is so you've got that you got like.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>One or 2 seconds.</p>
<p>Where it goes restful?</p>
<p>Right before you're either sinking or think.</p>
<p>And if you know that then that will bring you back to your focus space.</p>
<p>Yeah, you were dropping now of course, you have an option if your D coupling and you're dropping into really deep restful states. Then you know, maybe it's time to focus on rest for awhile.</p>
<p>Because you had a conscious drop out because you have the categories, the restful categories to work with.</p>
<p>It was for a beginner meditator would have been a not out.</p>
<p>OK would have been allowed out for a beginner, but because of all the.</p>
<p>Long years of practice.</p>
<p>It was a dropout.</p>
<p>I drop out of the time space Continuum.</p>
<p>A moment with the source.</p>
<p>So when you drop back in.</p>
<p>The world was.</p>
<p>Well, we could say.</p>
<p>It.</p>
<p>With this, but we were in a Catholic place so Latins good. This is Christian Christian phrase, I add them to wrestle.</p>
<p>I I was rent. I was resurrected the same but change.</p>
