<p>What?</p>
<p>What we sit on always or where our feet are planted always whether we're aware of that are not which is the spring of the air, the vibrancy of emptiness.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>To experience that in our inner and outer see, hear feel.</p>
<p>And to ride on that in how we express ourselves in body motion speech and the voluntary parts of the thinking process are triple Karma. So to speak our actions are motor circuits to experience the flow of emptiness in our sensory circuits.</p>
<p>Am to express' that very same spirit in the bounciness and spontaneity of our motor circuits. This is the paradigm that I like to use for how this path works.</p>
<p>Up.</p>
<p>And I mentioned that around the world there are.</p>
<p>Numerous ways and throughout history, numerous fundamental ways have been discovered to come to this, you can sort of deconstruct things through careful observation. I like that because I can turn it into a systematic algorithm that loops and branches. There's in theory, the possibility of nurture positive as a path to that.</p>
<p>Particularly as it's done in the flood Rihanna traditions. The deity yoga, where you eventually learn how to manifest. The deities from the void and at the end of the period of the deity Yoga period of the DD, yoga is called the gerim which means the stages of generation and then that's followed by so prim where it's all dissolved back into.</p>
<p>The emptiness and often they will use special physiological yogik practices to facilitate getting the emptiness down into the cellular level of ones being like the darkness of non rope and so forth if you're interested. So versions of nurture positive can achieve this at least in theory, then there's the whole OK do nothing approach.</p>
<p>Just call off the search.</p>
<p>And then there's sort of be conscious of consciousness self inquiry shine. The light back on itself who am I. What am I kinds of approaches. I think those are.</p>
<p>Sort of the four main highly contrasting strategies that we saw find around the world I encourage People to do it works different things work for different People at different times. I'm a little bit of verse. 2 People that claim. There's only one way that is stunningly better for all human beings that has just not been my experience different things work for different People at different times.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Pick your Medison.</p>
<p>And hopefully if you keep with it.</p>
<p>It will gradually converge or maybe suddenly converge to this kind of bouncy experience of you can call it liberation. You can call it unification. You can call it annihilation or you can call it.</p>
<p>Creation that's my version of creationism OK. My version of creationism is that you see how consciousness creates the inner and outer world moment by moment and you participate in that so form is emptiness. That sort of the first part of the process and then emptiness.</p>
<p>This form is.</p>
<p>Another theme that presents itself as you begin to be able to sort of enjoy seeing the world manifest and the self manifest.</p>
<p>Moment by moment continuous creation, Briard Yashma, iron in the Hebrew. The are the creation nation means both self and thing so the creation of self and thing map from iron the divine nothingness.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I left off by saying that in the Jewish Mystical tradition, the ability to do that is.</p>
<p>Related to an important theme call tekuno lobbed amending of the world. Which of course, is not other than the body's office service?</p>
<p>So.</p>
