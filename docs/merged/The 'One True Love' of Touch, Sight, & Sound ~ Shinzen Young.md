Year but wall-e herbal shirt.

Y UR one day boards all know work year, one day. Boo sure no eat so that was the rule in the chime monasteries that work.

So how are you going to meditate while you work?

They also brought in.

The Dallas notion.

Of Oneness.

The Oneness of the Dow, the one the Oneness of inside and outside the Oneness of humans with nature.

So you bring in the boot I never talked about Oneness.

The Buddha talked about freedom from suffering freedom from limited existence never talked about Oneness, but one this is certainly a facet.

Of.

Of the practice Taoism talked about that a lot, so.

How does that come together well?

If you were to do Zen with my teacher, Joshu Sasaki Roshi.

One of the first koans or questions, he give you is when you see the flower.

How do you become free?

How do you experience one true love?

When you hear the temple Bell? How do you experience one true love?

When you

Chop vegetables. How do you experience one true love notice these are touch sight sound?

Things.

So while you're working what do you need to work you need touches sights sounds?

What you don't need a whole lot of is memory plan fantasy and memory plan fantasy is infiel image talk?

It's in your mental pictures your internal conversations and your emotions around that.

So the idea would be that when you just see or just here or just touch.

As you're working.

Going about the labours of the day.

You could be having experiences of merging of Oneness with inside and outside.

Non dual nahs.

Because.

The feel image talk reactive self contracts as the touch sight sound.

Impact of the world expands so you can have this sort of more taoist experience of the Oneness with nature as you're going about working so it's perfect brings together the Taoist philosophical perspective with the.

The confusion work ethic.

Part of the focus on ordinary that I give you where we have touch sight sound. That's to allow you to sort of do that. Rinzai Zen thing as you're driving the car. You could still be in a deep state of meditation.

How do you experience one true love when you are driving in smog in Los Angelus?

Well.

Just drive.
