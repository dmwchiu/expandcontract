Instead of just observing the subjective system of feel image dog. We've been intentionally finding a creating holding and even radiating what I call positive states so.

Sometimes in the process of just observing it might happen to you, that you get a mental picture that has a deep positive significance for you, it might happen.

Native People value this very much and actually go through various physical ordeals of fasting and other ceremonies in order to get those deep sort of directional images and anthropologists. Call it a vision quest. Although native People just call it fasting if it Indian says I've been fasting they probably mean just spent.

4 days without any food or any water alone on a Hill.

Crying for a vision.

So it could happen as you're.

Just in the course of practice that a particularly powerful image comes up.

Or you could intentionally create it.

Uh so if it comes up spontaneously you can just note it if you're doing focus in and not treated in any way special or you can decide Hey. This is significant. I'm going to try to hold it intentionally.

Go with it and that becomes a focus on a positive image analogously it could happen just spontaneously that a wisdom.

Word or phrase something that encapsulates a certain good direction.

Psychologically behaviourally or spiritually for you, some something comes up in the talk space.

And you might want to just observe it or you might want to hold on to it. So then you could shift to a focus on positive but it's also possible to intentionally create those kinds of words phrases and sentences if you wish.

Positive feel is.

A special case, I would say of.

Of feel in general and its field that typically is pleasant, although you can have compassion type fields that are sort of sad. But in a compassionate way, etc. Quite how one would classify that I'm not sure. But usually the positive fields are pleasant their associated with a positive direction in your behavior or positive aspiration aspiration's for others.

But I also count positive field as pleasant sensations associated with being an highly concentrated states.

Pleasant sensations associated with the presence of flow. Restful states or just an intrinsic joy for no reason whatsoever. I hate to Canada in Sanskrit, miss joy.

That's just our birthright and it doesn't have to have a reason.

This would be a range of things that we could call positive feel, and they could come up once again spontaneously in our as we're just observing things or we can sort of look for it created attempt to hold it and when you look for it. When you decide to hold it if it's come up spontaneously or you intentionally look for it create it.

And then hold it that's an approach called focus on positive.

When you have things that fall under the category of positive come up spontaneously.

Then you sort of have a choice whether to deal with the matter of Factly.

Weather to go for a focus on positive, which is sort of a formal structure where you hold repeat and so forth or whether to go into just discursive thinking.

An like OK, I'm going to explore this and think about this in the normal way that I think about things because this seems like nature is opening an insight door or some window and I would like to pursue it discursively so essentially if something unusually positive comes up visually Auditoria Lee.

Or Somatically in the subject of domain as you're practicing I would say you have 3 choices and sorry to give you so many choices. But they're all good. The basic thing about not being freaked out by choices is to realize.

All the choices are good you're not going to miss out, no matter which one you take so one choices.

You're just going to deconstruct it.

There's famous story about.

You know the Zen Monk is meditating and the gods are so impressed by his practice that they come and like give Flowers everyday you know this goes on for a couple weeks and.

Finally, one day just.

Takes out the case Aqua beats the crap out all the gods and get the hell outta here OK well. It's it's a metaphor OK for being matter of fact no matter what comes up even if the gods give you Flowers and Bayview and whatever seemingly that's just feel image talk so even if you know very impactful think things come up you might decide to simply that's just feel image dog.

That's one decision and then you would be penetrating them. But in the same way that you would penetrate any sensory them. Alternatively, OK. Let's go to hold positive. It's a formal technique. I'm going to repeat that talk as a mantra, I'm going to try to maintain that image. I'm going to try to maintain that feel or some combination of those, 3, you know a pair or all 3 at once.

So then you go to focus on positive 3rd possibility Oh.

Nature seems to be presenting me with an insight window here.

I need to think about this and you start thinking you notice that I go nowhere without a notepad.

When?

Insights come.

I will often go into discursive thought.

And I will write things down, etc, etc. Now I know I'm suspending the formal practice in order to think.

In the normal way because I have to think in the normal way to pursue that insight and it is certainly OK to do that on occasion? What we want to avoid is.

A meditation that is only discursive thought because that's not really meditation, but it's certainly OK to do that when it seems appropriate.
