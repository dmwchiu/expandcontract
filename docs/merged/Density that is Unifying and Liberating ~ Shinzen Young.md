So we're talking about OK, I said, I actually contrast in spacious versus dance.

So for me, dense is just means not spacious.

OK, now here's where it gets where you have to be really careful about words and this is exactly the point you brought up.

Which I was wondering if anyone would bring up actually so good for you?

Um.

When you get into very highly concentrated states.

You can get a sense that things are thickening or getting quote dense.

But it's pleasant.

And it's unifying at all, so liberating.

That's contracted flow.

That's another flavor of contracted flow that Featherlight paper see expansion and contraction are.

Technical terms all what about technical terms, OK, they have very specific meanings expansion and contraction.

In my system.

Comfort a huge range of sub flavors.

The lightness thin this can be parsed as contracted that jonak.

Sort of quote density could also be parsed as contractive and they're both Pleasanton liberating just in different ways, so that's what I have to say about that.

Well, one obvious difference is.

That the

Quote bad debt.

Hurts like hell?

Whereas the good density really feels good.



Uh.

That's an obvious difference.

The reason for that difference if I were to put it in words is that they quote bad density.

Is comes about?

From resisting the contracted force.

Where is the quote good density comes about through deeply surrendering to the contract of course is not that subtle cellular?

Rigidity against contraction.

And the good density.

Is actually?

Halfway to global gone.

OK.

And global gone is a big deal, global gone is the 9th JAMA.

That's sit there for a week and your breasts tops.

Except having different obviously doesn't completely stop, but you know that's sort of Waxy Catatonic Physiological trance.

That's good if you're fortunate enough to be moving in that direction, so that's what I have to say about that.
