<p>The.</p>
<p>Greek adjective that means related to movement change and the underlying forces and energies that could produce movement and change so I like that. Word dynamic that covers a wide range in its definition.</p>
<p>So we can within ordinary or restful experience distinguish a static aspect and a dynamic aspect and we're particularly interested in the dynamic aspect. Not that that's better than the static but when it appears it's something that we can choose to work with and it's continuous side. I call flow and it's.</p>
<p>More abrupt or discontinuous side. I call gone our vanishing in terms of working with change. You can focus on just the flow or just the banishing but if there happens to be vanishings within the flows bursts of flows arise and then noticeably subside. You could sort of combine those 2.</p>
<p>Is that flow or is that just my heart beating?</p>
<p>Its flow because anything where you can focus on the theme of changing this.</p>
<p>Counts as flow, so things that have Vibra Tori, or pulsatory qualities. Whatever their source. Maybe definitely count as flow. A lot of the subtle vibra. Tori flow that People report through their body is in fact.</p>
<p>The pulse well it's the circulation of the blood through the vessels that causes those like Vibra. Tori sensations and you can know that because if you run or something like that. You get more of that stuff, so it doesn't matter if the sense of flow has been produced by some gross physical something obviously material physical in origin. It's not like there's some.</p>
<p>That doesn't count as an instance of change because it's like Oh just by heart beating kind of thing.</p>
<p>There is a wide range of flavors of flow, but basically.</p>
<p>There's various frequencies that I call Generically Vibra Tori, but People talk about how.</p>
<p>Weather words People use bubbly scintillating missed twinkly sparkly. What are some of the other ones for the sort of vibra Tori? Well, Vibra Tori use that generically for all the frequencies. Pulse pulsation for this lower frequencies, so there's sort of generically stuff, it seems like it's vibrating.</p>
<p>Then there's stuff that seems more WAVY sort of lava lamp like seaweed in a tidepool kind of streaming protoplasm. That kind of thing and then there's spreading collapsing outward pressures inward pressures sense of scattering sense of gathering expensive contractive type flavors.</p>
<p>All of the above counters flow so vast range of phenomena and certainly unawareness of the heartbeat and an awareness of the blood making sort of Vibra. Tori flow throughout the body is definitely an instance of flow.</p>
<p>How does TS Eliot put it?</p>
<p>The dance along the artery the circulation of the lymph is figured in the drift of stars.</p>
<p>It's all part of Nature's flow.</p>
<p>As a general principle within the system flow is just something if it's there. You observe it if it's not there, then it's not there. The static aspect is dominant.</p>
<p>Now that's not to say that.</p>
<p>There's some cosmic meditative rule that you're not allowed to do practices that intentionally create or manipulate flow. That's not the case at all. That's integral to a lot of cheap going exercises. Kundalini yoga exercises and so forth and it's completely valid practice and if you want to do those practices and then get things going with that and then you go to a VPS and on you just observe.</p>
<p>Well, that's fine, but I wouldn't consider it part of Vipasa, not strictly speaking.</p>
<p>Yes, with time and practice the resolution can be so great that there's always flow every.</p>
<p>Having said that though.</p>
<p>That's very dangerous, it's one of the things like that statement that are one of the reasons. I'm a bad meditation teacher because I say something like that.</p>
<p>They put their said safe say only what is true and useful?</p>
<p>What I just said is true, it's arguable whether it's useful?</p>
<p>Because.</p>
<p>It could be useful well let's make the case. It's useful. Obviously, I must have thought it's in some sense useful. I wouldn't say it at all.</p>
<p>It's useful because it can inspire People and give People a goal to work towards it's not useful and in fact, extremely harmful.</p>
<p>Statement.</p>
<p>If it sets up in that person, A.</p>
<p>I need.</p>
<p>To have that kind of resolution.</p>
<p>At a sense of failure and frustration when you don't.</p>
<p>That's a general theme in working with flow if you got flow in one area.</p>
<p>It will have a natural tendency to induce flow in other areas and you could sort of.</p>
<p>You sort of.</p>
<p>This is a little weird sounding but so let's say you have flow in one domain and you have solidity over here.</p>
<p>As what the meditator can do is play the role of.</p>
<p>The shot Han you don't know that word but a shadow. Khan is Jewish. Marriage broker you sort of get the flow part and introduce the flow part of the solid part and then you don't need to do anything more. They just have a pretty yeah. That's right. The flow then tends to induce into this. The solid part which is what you would sounds like what you were doing. That's a little bit of an esoteric strategy. But if you interactively guide a person they can often do that.</p>
<p>Can be a little harder to reproduce on your own?</p>
