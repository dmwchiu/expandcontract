Seriously, good.

So tonight's her last night and there were several requests to talk about the iconic representation of human happiness. So I'm going to do that. First, though I want to respond to a question actually Asia gave really good question. And so I just want to briefly respond to that which is.

On this path where does the love come from? I think that was the takeaway piece right?

How yeah? Where does it fit it so I would say that?

The actual word that's used.

In a lot of the Buddhist world is this would be the.

God.

Got forgetting how to write Chinese use it or lose it.





Good enough or right, yeah, yeah, this guys pretty sure this doesn't have that stuff right.

So Bay in Mandarin Chinese G he in Japanese.

This one means love it might 3 in Sanskrit Meta and Polly.

This is corresponds to the lab and God or not compassion.



And these are sort of linked concept so when you say where does the love come from within a sort of Buddhist way of thinking about things that's where does the my 3:00 carnal come from or how does it fit in?

And so that got me thinking.

And it seems to me that within the framework that I present to you procedures and the categories.

There are it comes from 4 sources.

One is it's just natural human beings are born with a natural sense of love. In fact because I'm getting sort of Chinese tonight, but there's a word in Chinese.

That means according to Confucius.

It carries this sense of natural log that everyone is born with pronounce run and it's a character for person, and the character for 2:00. So it's like the natural thing for People is to love each other. That's the way we're born, according to Confucius. So then what happens when what happens is that we accumulate a lot of poison and pain and our primordial.

Sort of instinct to love gets covered over by many physical, emotional mental uncomfortable experiences in the process from infancy process of socialization process, discovering the physical world can hurt you the natural spontaneous love.

Gets covered over so as we work through that store poison and pain as it percolates up in our practice and we essentially don't do anything about it. We just open up to it, and let it dissipate don't reinforce it.

So that stored poison in pain gets worked through.

And to the extent that.

The suffering the seeds of suffering are being extirpated from US to that extent that primordial love just gets uncovered again. It's always been there.

So that's one source of it. Another source actually related by the little different side to it is remember its compassion and love. So they GE so that the struggles that we go through.

When we do this path, particularly in the beginning and.

Gotta be honest, the beginnings about the 1st 20 years, particularly in the beginning, particularly in the beginning of the beginning, which is maybe the first five years. We are very, very typically. We humans who take on this path are very uncomfortable while we're doing the practice. We we do everything we can to show you how to have fun and so forth, but the 18 minutes in the body.

There's the.

Scattered Nahs in the mind, there's all sorts of emotions. Confusions sleepiness within the context of North American repulsing a practice of course, you can take a break. Anytime you want, but within the Asian sort of traditional training and whatever if you're in a monastery. There are no breaks its merciless and it can be pretty damn hellacious.

During those initial years of training.

So you might say Well, Gee. That's sort of like really bad, but the effect of that is to impart within a person.

An unforgettable lesson in the nature of human misery.

You I know you wonder like why do I have to face all this **** when I sit here my personal **** Well, part of it is that later on down the line. When to a certain extent that's gotten worked through.

You will never forget how miserable you were at you realize that most human beings live in that kind of misery.

And you will have a sense of compassion for them because of what you had to go through.

So that's one of the uses you don't realize it at the time at the time it's just like.

You know why does this have to be so hard and why am I so miserable etc etc. But then you look back at you realize Oh I was. I was learning a lesson. That's going to stay with me for my entire life. I really know what it means to be miserable.

I can tell you in the monastery in Japan. I definitely knew what it meant to be miserable 24/7 and it was relative to Japanese standards by no means the most rigorous kind of environment. Now the most rigorous training environment in Japan is mill, Shinji Zen Temple. It's called only Sodo.

Only then soda and Zachary mean the same thing. Only then only in Japanese means demon demon demon meditation. All the expression is for the first three years. The novice never shows the white of their teeth, meaning they never smile. Once in the first three years of the training is just abject misery.

Crucially, Lorenzo Co in Japanese, it means like unending sequence of Miseries.

Uh.

But.

As the result of that it produces People like society well, she my teacher, Sasaki Roshi.

That's where he trained 10 years at least I'm thinking at Mill Shinji.

And now 104.

The activity of compassion does not stop. There's no retiring. There's no vacations. It's although it's like all service all the time.

To anyone who wants to do the practice. Where does that kind of vitality come from? Where does that endless patients come from from those horrific early years where you know you will never forget the misery of the average human being, however, transcended he becomes and he'll care so there's compassion and it's love, so one thing is well as you work through your poison and pain.

The natural love is just there another is that?

In the process of working through your own poison to pin you have to face your poison in pain. And that gives you this sense of compassion for the human condition, that's the gold standard of spirituality is love of the human condition.

Uh.

It's beyond love of humanity. I mean could love humanity. But you have to love the human condition, which is really screwed up.

So that's another source.

Then there's merging there's I've now there's the experience of other as yourself and that comes in 2. Flavors relative and absolute most of you are familiar with the focus out technique where you anchor yourself in the physical senses sites and so forth that causes a relative merging of inside and outside so you experience other as yourself.

Quite literally not as a concept, but as actual sensory event because it's all about expansion and contraction. And so, if the touch sight sound of another expands and you allow the image Doc and emotional body of your subjective world to contract. Then you experience other as self. And if you have many, many, many experiences like that, well that leads to an I thou relationship with other.

As opposed to an eye, it or were still an US versus them relationship.

So that merging that comes about by focusing out that's a relative wannous and so that with which you are one. You naturally feel some love for then there's the absolute merging which is to share 0.

Not only does the subject disappear, the object disappears and you and the other abide in the source.



The dimensionless point before The Big Bang of each moment of self and world. Each mind moment is a sort of little version of The Big Bang, a little Big Bang.

Like little big man or something so we have these little big bags and before each little Big Bang quote before.

There is

What the one the singular the singularity the zero and so having those absolute mergings experiences with People you come to a sense that we all sort of our have our feet placed whether we know it or not. We're all have our feet placed the same groundless ground.

And so that gives you another reason for viewing others as brother and sisters share the room with Formless Moon. That's what brother and sister in Greek Adelphos.

It means our Delphos arming Charan Delfos is move.

So that which which you share the world, the formless wood, the same source. Naturally, there's a sense of.

Love and conserved so those are I could think of within the theoretical and practice framework that I give you that would be 4 places where love comes from comes in.

So.
