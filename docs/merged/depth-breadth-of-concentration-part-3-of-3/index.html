<p>It will always require a lot of effort.</p>
<p>Now it is true that initially.</p>
<p>When you attempt to develop concentration for attention, wanders you bring it back your attention wanders you bring it back. This does require a certain amount of effort.</p>
<p>Initial.</p>
<p>But it is not the case that it's always going to require that effort. A time comes when it's.</p>
<p>Automatic.</p>
<p>And no longer effortful. Yes, you have to be willing to invest a certain amount of effort and even after it becomes effortless. There may be times when you're facing sensory challenges when you have to effort again.</p>
<p>But it's not the case that forever and ever and ever. It's this huge herculean orsus ipheion task that you're undertaking.</p>
<p>You train yourself to be able to maintain profound concentration states while doing in very complex or chaotic environment and that's the dimension of growth of concentration that I referred to as it broadens it encompases more and more of life.</p>
<p>So when I went into that 100 day training.</p>
<p>I had.</p>
<p>Could sometimes get a little bit of flavor of concentration through formal sitting counting the breath and I? Could I could get a little bit of concentration what I would do simple tasks.</p>
<p>I came out to 100 days later and.</p>
<p>I was not the same person I had been fundamentally re engineered. It was a very small price to pay you. I think 100 days. A big price is like a long time. That's a big deal. It's a very small price to pay to.</p>
<p>For a new life essentially after that.</p>
<p>That taste of concentration was always present for me 24/7.</p>
<p>Now of course, as fun as it is to tell these horror stories or war stories about intense training in Asia. It's also sort of not a good thing to tell People why, why is this not a good thing to tell you?</p>
<p>Because if that's what you have to go through to get this. I don't think I'm going to sign up in this lifetime. Natural reactions like what I'm going to torture myself with cold water for 100 days if I wanted to have perennial somebody.</p>
<p>No, not necessary in Buddhism, they have this concept called Upaya or skillful means.</p>
<p>You don't you don't have to rely on brute force methods. You can work smart and get the same results.</p>
<p>And my attempt to formulate the techniques and the concepts of this path in a very precise way is my attempt to allow ordinary North American let's say modern People.</p>
<p>To allow you to get the same results that monastics get without the brute force methods.</p>
<p>So now you don't have to go through this kind of thing in order to get comparable results. You can work smart. And, yes, you may have to amortize it over a longer period of time.</p>
