<p>Both gone.</p>
<p>Simultaneous expansion contraction and their vanishing.</p>
<p>So float float well both at but both is the label for unawareness that there is simultaneous expansion and contraction. That's part of the that's part of So so the quick answers in terms of what's on the grid its expansion contraction flow. That's what I that's what I typically am aware of OK and then when I was reading the manual about that for us.</p>
<p>It was 'cause I love flow and I and so forth, but I also saw that it was like don't forget to stay in see, hear and feel rest. The focused out and it focused him focus then just because there's subtle levels that you don't want to know that you're still needing to process understand so it's OK to have sort of a main practice.</p>
<p>But if you're familiar with the whole grid. I encourage People at least occasionally to touch base with other things, just to get some balance.</p>
<p>But that's just a light suggestion if you're not familiar with the whole grid. Obviously you can't do that. But let's say you're familiar with the whole thing I think it's.</p>
<p>A lot of People have a single thing that they do that's their main practice.</p>
<p>Oh, but if you are familiar with this other stuff. I think it's useful to touch base at least occasionally with it for round rounding purposes. But if you're not familiar with the whole bread, then you just can have just one practice.</p>
<p>But remember that.</p>
<p>One of the ways you push the envelope is by me if there's a particular proceed particular approach that you like you see well. Can you maintain it like in motion and then in daily life etc. So maybe you could get like a lot of flow when you're sitting but can you actually get it while you're talking to People and driving the car that's a wave like pushing the envelope with the practice.</p>
