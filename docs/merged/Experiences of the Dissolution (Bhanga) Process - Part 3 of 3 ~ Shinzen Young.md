What I've been exploring I mean in my own practice is?

How how suffering is created by the free cab by the spasm by the fit space fit fit the fit fit exactly exactly and that's

That feel image talk, the does spasm doesn't, it, you like a spasm of the body. But it's subjective space and you become a hard as a rock and you become a terrified thing.

And you create you create.

You create yourself that's how you in my mind become a billiard ball and how the situation becomes a billiard ball in your just frozen you see that happening everywhere how we relate to the world and the practice let you go from the particular paradigm to the wave.

Should we do so take a moment to lengthen your spine and let your full body settle?



Which is just our old friend physical relaxation?

And, which you say at this time in your body and or mine that there's

Any of that flow going on or think this thing are things pretty triangle. There's there's quite a lot of flow going on.

Is it in the body or mind also?

Asked in the body or mind also it's.

It's in the body.

Uh.

By mind I mean image talk space image talk space. This was always the interesting thing about flow.

Because.

There can be for example of vibrational.

Hum in my body.

I feel it in touch space.

I feel it in in and out in field space.

I feel it in talk space.

I feel it in sound space external sound external sound space and image space also and sometimes.

If the vibration gets strong enough and is often connected to my heartbeat syncopated with my heartbeat. It actually modulate side space external external sales. You get it in internal image also that I've got the screen vibration on that thanks so much actually about waving is not so much. The body is waiting big time. But how about the images do they melt in more mental pictures, not many mental pictures. You don't get so it's not much in image space.

But it's in the other modalities that almost all of almost all the others how about right now is it is the vibra. Tori flavor of flow present in most of those modalities is.

Here's what I'd like you to do.

I'd like you to moment by moment note flow.

And we're going to tune into that, but each time you note flow.

I'd like you to spread your awareness do the zoom out option spread your awareness is broadly as you can through body mind and even external world to sort of do a coverage moment by moment zooming out does that make sense.

You understand what I'm talking about yes and I'd like you to begin by using spoken labels. Note flow say the word out loud to use the tone of voice and the pacing for the equanimity in the concentration.

Flow.

Flow.

Flow.

That's perfect I can tell by the tone of voice that you're in deep equanimity and I can tell by the pacing that your concentration is good is that correct.

Yes, good now go to the standard optional labeling either speak the labels out loud or make the mental or no label at all.

Sort of shifting like years.

Whatever works best for you.

And.

Zoom out each time to cover the flow, as broadly as it may be present in your sensory experience and let it sort of unify and integrate body mind, maybe body mind and world.

How does that instruction makes sense yes it did?

And we'll just see what happens, I'll just do my own practice while you do.

That topic along OK.

Very much OK.

What's OK or good about it?

I don't know.

Stay with it as you speak see if you want to speak slowly. That's OK. So to stay with it as you as you describe it. In this particular instance. It's become more focused in hide, and then I.

Have experienced before perhaps it's

Guidance or

Something but when I say flow.

It's just.

A unified field of Softap Pleasant waves.

And almost every sense except.

Image that's fine and uh and of course, my eyes are closed. So where did tend to affect site space if you open your eyes?

Why don't you do that see what happens D focus your eyes just let light in?

See if it affects visual with your eyes open may or may not.



When I label flow and penetrate with eyes open, I moved from site to light.

Yes, that's good.

Do that just relate to it as line. Now I'd like you to go back to the practice that you're doing, noting flow zooming out the awareness.

And it you can cover.

The light coming in from the outside World, as part of the flow.

Materi ality of the world is now breaking up along with the.

Carnality of your body and the something this of your mind.

And just sort of stay with that for a little while.





How's it coming?

Very nicely.

And is there going to up the challenge level.

I'd like you to see if you can keep some contact with that.

And make eye contact.

What I was going to say?

Excellent.

Able to do that a little bit.

Not sure.

So.



This is what you can do.

Your little gift to the world.

Any questions about that.



OK.



Wow.

Yeah, yeah.

OK.

No, I think we're done.
