<p>May.</p>
<p>Pacific way in which?</p>
<p>Techniques for any specific.</p>
<p>Issue.</p>
<p>Yes, I.</p>
<p>Found out recently or in the last couple of years that I am either allergic to codeine or it.</p>
<p>Doesn't like me whatever and I was having some back issues an my doctor prescribed coding for me in a Tylenol 3.</p>
<p>And I had said to her. I don't think I can take coding because years ago when I was experiencing Gallbladder problems. I started having extreme stomach issues with it and she said Oh that was probably your Gallbladder.</p>
<p>Well, it wasn't in the middle of the night. I went in my stomach went into an extreme spasm.</p>
<p>And I immediately started doing my practice.</p>
<p>It escalated an yes, it became much more difficult. I actually sent my husband downstairs to get a CD. That was how to deal with pain or like I wanted Jensen to guide me.</p>
<p>And while it was extremely difficult. I think it really, really helped I spoke with him. After that because even after my years of meditation.</p>
<p>I thought I could do better at it, but</p>
<p>But he was very kind and said, You know until some of these really, really big issues hit us. We don't. You don't know what you would have been if you didn't have the practice.</p>
<p>Can you give an example of what you specifically did?</p>
<p>I I did I did 2 things I did the focus away from the pain and I also focused on I needed both should send techniques when you're focusing away. I was, I was looking for restful spaces within my body within my talk space. I was focusing away from the pain by trying to find the relaxed.</p>
<p>Rest spot, so that the pain wasn't so intense and then when we get to the point where the focus. I had to focus on it, then I was using focus on the pain and I was watching the intensity. The shape whether it was sharp or dull whether it moved was there a color to it that I could focus on to sort of that. You know that allows the pain to spread more.</p>
<p>Can be less intense in one area that's what I did?</p>
<p>I ended up going to the emergency anyway, but</p>
<p>Yes, it's a coding something you discussed that work out of your system.</p>
