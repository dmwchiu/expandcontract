<p>Uh.</p>
<p>I gave a whole riff on the Jewish meditation tradition and I ended with.</p>
<p>This song.</p>
<p>Lurianic Kabbalistic concept of what a human being or a human soul is.</p>
<p>Which I find delightful since it literally Maps 1 to one with the way that I present?</p>
<p>The meditation techniques.</p>
<p>If we want to define broadly. The self that would be body mind experience so in that case in terms of the standard categories. It's touch feel image talk.</p>
<p>But then as you pay very close attention to any of those or any combination. You begin to notice the presence of change.</p>
<p>And the more you pay attention to rates of change the more you're also paying attention to what might be called underlying forces. This is basic actually basic Newtonian physics don't have to get esoteric with quantum or relativistic invisible force fields can be detected in terms of how they impact acceleration's.</p>
<p>As you're noticing rates of change, you get a sense that there is a kind of fundamental.</p>
<p>Uh and impersonal doing then that sort of pervades.</p>
<p>The physicality of the body, the emotionality of the body, the mental processes.</p>
<p>Zen master wins, I talked about.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Wait run run at love that expression.</p>
<p>The.</p>
<p>The true person.</p>
<p>The authentic person.</p>
<p>That everyone has within them.</p>
<p>That has no fixed position.</p>
<p>Whatsoever and I just.</p>
<p>Screwed up started to write my own name, instead of well, same character. The true or authentic is John in Mandarin Chin in LA.</p>
<p>In.</p>
<p>Japanese so wait to run.</p>
<p>Movie no shinjin in Japanese pronunciation that true person within us that has no fixed position In other words, isn't a thing, but is a doing and I'm not sure if he was rinci or another. Zen master that talked about up the invisible hand inside the puppet.</p>
<p>And would you believe it?</p>
<p>Some of the Kabbalistic Masters had exactly the same metaphor.</p>
<p>As you're paying attention to.</p>
<p>That expanding contracting vibrating field that.</p>
<p>That moment by moment is churning.</p>
<p>The body mind self into existence.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>In a cleft producing a cleft that.</p>
<p>Within which it arises which is totally the Kabbalistic theme.</p>
<p>You become aware that that activity wells up in subsides. It comes from one rich nothing.</p>
<p>In other words, you start to notice how the how there's a rising.</p>
<p>And then there's a neutralizing to a kind of nothing and then there's an absolute continuity between.</p>
<p>The gone and the next arising.</p>
<p>So there's a continuum.</p>
<p>This is non dual awareness there's a continuum between the nothing the polarization of the nothing.</p>
<p>The arising of physical, emotional and mental self.</p>
<p>And then the reabsorption of that.</p>
<p>Back into the Energi that then flatlines again when you reach the point where there's.</p>
<p>Where that is an absolute continuous process?</p>
<p>Then you're doing pretty good in your practice.</p>
<p>And when you reach the point where that happens as your boppin around in the world taking care of business.</p>
<p>Then you're doing really, really, really good at your practice. In fact, you're gets you up there to the Zen Master. The beginnings of the Zen master class of meditator so I have you look at?</p>
<p>Physicality in the body emotionality in the body.</p>
<p>The mental image is an internal talk that are the mind, then the underlying flow.</p>
<p>And it's vanishing into the one zero because all.</p>
<p>Almost all vanishings all zeros are uncreative equal there all the same 0.</p>
<p>Therefore.</p>
<p>To the extent that you're anchored in that.</p>
<p>You your belly button and the belly button of.</p>
<p>All of any other piece of creation overlap.</p>
<p>And you share the same belly button, you share the same womb.</p>
<p>And therefore you have a sense of the fraternity and sorority of all of creation would you believe it.</p>
<p>There, according to the Kabbalistic notion of what a human being is what a soul is a soul. That's the word that often trance late. But I think it's really what a person is the soul is called neuron high.</p>
<p>You have the physicality of the body.</p>
<p>Then you have the emotionality a body rule. Then you have above that nasha mark, which is the mental process so that's image talk touch feel.</p>
<p>This is image taught.</p>
<p>Underlying all and pervading all of that is higher.</p>
<p>The impersonal enerji that would correspond to.</p>
<p>What I call flow but in China they might call chi and so forth?</p>
<p>AT and it is emphasized by the kabbalists that these last 2.</p>
<p>Even though they?</p>
<p>They pervade the person and the person is in intimate moment by moment contact with them, They.</p>
<p>Are not part of human they are the part that links the human?</p>
<p>Specific to the source specifically high eyes. This kind of Energe. And, yes, he da comes from the root a hard, meaning one. It's the one the one Watt?</p>
<p>But one nothing.</p>
<p>The one belly button.</p>
<p>The one zero.</p>
<p>That is the source of the molding force. It's where it comes from it where it's where it goes back to so that's</p>
<p>The gods that's the vanishings that I have the label so if I were to have you say OK. We're going to work in the body mind self and we're going to note touch feel image talk.</p>
<p>And we're also going to note flow and vanishing flow, and gone.</p>
<p>We would be Essentia Lee using the Lurianic Kabbalistic Formulation.</p>
