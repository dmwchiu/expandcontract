Here, the basic formula.

As you'll recall.

Is?

Mindful awareness.

Leads to

6 factors.

That constitute

Let's just say it's for you.

This is the happy pointing to you.

On.

There's 6 things that are thought of as being whoops. Let's do it surface 1st.

Surface or ordinary human happiness.

And remember it was get pleasure in the body avoid discovered in the body.

Get various answers in the mind avoid don't know mind.

In the mind get situations that you want.

And avoid situations that you don't want OK.

This ordinary happiness plus deep happiness.

For yourself.

Deep happiness you remember the difference, OK here, you want fulfillment.

Here you want to you want to elevate fulfillment. You want to avoid suffering you want to get the answer.

And you want to be able to experience don't know mind.

As an OK thing.

Uh.

And then here instead of situations its behavior.

You want a man to love cause and effect positive behavior cut down on negative object to behavior those of the object effectors ease of the sensory factors.

This.

Leads to a motivation.

To help other People.

And I mentioned why that is, and what form that takes so this is a love of the human condition.



What I do there?

It was the heart and this is the Chinese character for humanity.

This is bodhichitta.



This leads to bodhicitta in the Buddhist context.

Which then leads you?

To spread surface and deep happiness to others.

And all of this, this plus this.

And this.

Equals total human happy.

It's this plus this it's not just.

Of learning how to get fulfillment. It's also getting pleasure is not just avoiding suffering. It's also avoiding discomfort is not just getting enlightenment answers. It's getting this too.

These together the situations you want.

So this plus this leading to this.

Leading to this.

You'll have to have happy in every way.



So that's details about happiness.
