An acquaintance of mine wrote a book called 10% happier Dan. Harris is on the Nightline right and I think ABC.

Good Morning America or something like that right, he's like a Taco, but he's one of us.

He famously had a panic attack on Camera all at some point in his career, which you can actually see it's on YouTube. It's like will be there forever right? That was his wake up call that he had something was radically wrong with his life. Major part of his recovery was to take on this practice mindfulness practice.

But because he's in the position of being.

You know prominent television personality. It's sort of cool for us, so he he wrote. This book called 10% happier.

And he's got a whole program that goes with it actually is partnering up with one of my facilitators. Jeff Warren from Canada. There on tour now in the US sort of bringing the message of mindfulness says so cool that were that mainstream at this point anyway.

That the title of that book got be thinking about my own life.

So you know 10% happier and I started to calculate in my mind did the like of a thought experiment.

OK, at my current age.

What would the picture be?

If I hadn't made that decision at the age of 25 two.

By Hook or Crook Meditate every day of my life.

What if I hadn't done that? What if I just been one of the million other things that I could have been.

As a non meditator. So where would I be given who I was at 25.

Extrapolating, where would I be and then where I know myself to be as the result of that decision.

And.

Objectively, I just had to say.

It's it's not 10% happier it's 10 times happier.

I mean, Object Ivli Easilly 10 times, happier or put the other way. I would be 110th as happy, which actually would be like pretty miserable so anyway, I encourage you in that regard.
