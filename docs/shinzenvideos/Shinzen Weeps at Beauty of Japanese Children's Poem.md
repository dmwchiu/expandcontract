Every Japanese child has to learn the euro ha.

The Arrow Hot is the traditional.

Ordering of that Japanese script here are gonna are you aware that Japanese language is written in a combination of Kanji, which are Chinese characters and comma, which are Japanese syllables syllabaries.

And there's 2 kinds of comma, but the one that's normally used is called Hugh to Donna.

And the way that schoolchildren learn here. Dagama is they learn a pole.
