Right.

Most People.

At least occasionally in their life have had the experience of.

Just sort of starting to flap their lips and magically something self organized.

I call that auto speak.

Um so I wondered is there a way to sort of trained People so that that's more likely to happen in their daily life.

So one way to do that is through a process that I call auto chant you take something that you're very familiar with some People use Mont Resource, Scriptures, but it can be anything that you're thoroughly familiar with and chanted out loud and you just sort of let your speech organs self organized so it's the auditory analogue of the auto walk now.

We want the techniques that we can use in a secular context say in a clinical medical situation or in a school so we won't encourage People to use things that are explicitly religious or from a foreign culture. When we go into these mainstream situations. But I mean, if you belong to a certain religion or like a certain culture. You can chat things like Ohm, Namah Shivaya or?

Oh money Padme home or um pattern Upstair Ave Maria. Whatever appeals to you. But in a secular context. I like to use something simple. So maybe numbers so here's auto chant by the numbers.

123456789 ten 123456789 ten 123456789 ten.

Wonder they will rise eleven 8991 knew they were rising 11 eight nine nine one dollar. They are rising. Eleven 991 River rising 79 and 103 more wise eleven 89. Now I'm sort of tuning in to the fact that there's just air blowing across my teeth and tissues are flapping and they sort of know what to do and it's fun. I should say that in some religious traditions. They have what's called glossal lately out.

And by the way that's not Justin Charismatic Christian things in North America. There are analogs of that. In other cultures. I saw it in Japan at Mount Koya. For example, and something like that happens in Sioux booed which is in Islamic context in Indonesia. This is what's called speaking in tongues now? What's significant about the Glossa Lalia.

Or speaking in tongues is it's audible so actually there right. It is sort of the spirit now. Sometimes there's a belief that there actually speaking grammatical human languages like Aramaic or?

What have you Unfortunately that is apparently not the case so but so the content may not actually be human speech but the contour is truly the spirit so there's a validity to that and it can be honored as that so that's

Auto speak.
