How about if we took everything as our object well that's actually not that much bigger than my body just sights and sounds.

So answer People usually find pretty easy site that's a lot more challenging.

But with practice you can start to sort of get us complete experience or something near a complete experience of the sites in front of you.

And that's very rich and also very transparent.

So it sort of seems like.

This just this shaft of knowing.

That goes from your eyes.

Sorry I don't know how to describe it goes through the back of your head out through your eyes.

Out to the farthest regions of the visual space.

And it's just like.

This this shaft of.

Clarity.

That.

It like it, it bores a wormhole from void the void.

Through the something iness of the surrounding seen each time your AI ships here here here here, you're actually.

Sort of seeing the world, but you're also seeing.

The source.

I would like looking in from all sides at once.

All.

So it's very rich and very.

Freeing and empty.

So I'm looking.

Being known.

Um.

Known to death.
