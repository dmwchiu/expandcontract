<p>Anything you'd like to just tell me briefly about those issues before we start to work in terms of what it is, and what your goals would be in working on it? Yeah.</p>
<p>What I'm working with now is a strong?</p>
<p>Feel component that has.</p>
<p>You might call it touch. I sometimes called secondary field with that tension that comes around the field can lock into quite a dramatic degree when it first arose it seemed triggered by external event. But what I as a response emotional response to an event. But I think it became clear that as I processed it that it kind of worked as a magnet to draw years.</p>
<p>To? Who knows what other stuff up with it that matched that.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Emotional frequency and then for awhile now several days. I've been working with it there. I let go of their having to be any talk image component and it's just a huge amount of Field Which.</p>
<p>I have techniques and ability to process but it's.</p>
<p>Quite a a significant event an I thought Ah time to call in the big guns. An I thought you could help me with this and maybe someone could benefit from it help. Let me ask some questions so I can make sure I understand the situation.</p>
<p>Ann you're having a lot of emotional type body sensation like all feel right. But I think that you're saying that you have.</p>
<p>A muscle tension reaction to that feel when it arises when I think there's a very, very strong field and because it is so non stop.</p>
<p>An intense that the body just starts to tighten around it in a way that I'm working not only with the field. But I have to kind of work with the tightening that comes around it. And so I might work with one then work with the other, but there's no question the core. It's feel, and everything else is just because it bends so intense for so long. The bodies just starting to and I'm literally now experiencing physiological.</p>
<p>Things in the body just simply from that tightening around the field does that make sense and so you want to work with this sensory phenomenon. The underlying emotional sensations or feel as we would put it in the technical vocabulary body sensation. That seems emotional and then there's a kind of physical response in the form of muscle tension an that muscle tension. Some People consider that to be a fit a yearly physical sensation.</p>
<p>But because it's so linked with the emotions. Some People considered to be in it to be in and of itself. An emotional sensation that we can parse it. Either way to hang on? What's natural for that person.</p>
<p>I have a few other questions to ask you it sounds to me like you've already been working with it in the way that I would be that I would consider optimal by that. I mean that you're sometimes focusing on the tension reaction, sometimes focusing on the underlying feel itself, which is the general strategy of dividing conquer so and I've been I've been using a lot of.</p>
<p>Flow is probably where my natural strength is and so and I can work with flow and almost immediately have some kind of response to that of going into it, but then it re arises in Rican deal. so I thought OK. I've gotta maybe more deeply or maybe you can just help me well probably the strategies that you are using?</p>
<p>Are already optimal but that's my guess?</p>
<p>At, it's simply a matter of continuing with them.</p>
<p>But let's just do some interactive stuff and we'll see what comes up. I'm not sure that there's actually anything new to add content wise it may just be a numbers game of continuing what you're now doing but like I said. Let's see what happens do you have a couple more questions? Does the tension reaction that you're referring to?</p>
<p>Does that?</p>
<p>Tend to come up.</p>
<p>In a pronounced pattern.</p>
<p>In real time or is it more of an going sort of situation. By that I mean, is there a clear sense of they'll be an eruption of field and then there's a tension eruption of field. Then there's attention or is it that attention is sort of there.</p>
<p>In a fairly on going way or does it tend to fluctuate moment by moment with the fluctuations in the field. I a little bit of the second a little bit of 3rd that the field is pretty continuous pretty intense. But there is a rising and falling depending on if I'm able to give it.</p>
<p>You know if I'm able to stop and go into it, sometimes it might multiply and effect times 10 and become quite.</p>
<p>More than what you wanted to deal with, but I'm assuming that's a part of the process. Sometimes my work with it will help it flow. The tension does not correspond directly to the field and I've and what I'm calling the tension is just from the field, having been so consistent. There's a kind of uh not breathing in a tensing in its creating stuff in the back end.</p>
<p>So it's not really a moment by moment tensing.</p>
<p>Physical muscle tensing around emotional body sensation. It's more, the result that the emotional body. Sensations have been on going for so long that you're getting this secondary sensation, yeah, OK now let me ask some other questions.</p>
<p>The.</p>
<p>You talk about the field, breaking up into flow and I'm assuming that happens with some consistency. You know whenever I focus in on it. Yes, that that's about the tension reaction does it break up in the flow?</p>
<p>If I'm focusing twords that yes, yes that can break up Ken Break up into flow, as well. They all do kind of.</p>
<p>Like a rubber band snap back into place a lot. It just feels like. There's just been a momentum of break up into float, but then they can re solidify so you can actually have the tension.</p>
<p>And the feel both turn into flow with your practice can you have you attempted to do that during practice in motion like walking minute practice and so far pretty much? Yes, I. I have to otherwise I wouldn't be able to function. I wouldn't be doing this today, if I wasn't so you can already get them both to dissolve into flow, which is.</p>
<p>Pretty but when I'm doing in action In other words, If I'm stopping and all of my awareness is going into that I can go total flow. But when I have to also do this activity or talk to this person or do something like that. All of my attention isn't on it, so there's some congealing. All you know, I can do enough flow to function, but I'm not you know floating on clouds.</p>
<p>All the way through I do have periods where something like there's certain activities that help the flow. When I'm doing a laughing meditation or or when I'm facilitating somebody.</p>
<p>I literally don't.</p>
<p>It pretty much all goes flow during certain activities. But the rest of the time. It's having to kind of keep some awareness there in some awareness here just to kind of function couple more questions? Yeah.</p>
<p>Is the?</p>
<p>Which is?</p>
<p>The source of the greatest distress is it the feel or the tension real feel absolutely so you're not so concerned with dealing with the tension well. That'll go when the field. So yeah, so the core issue is intensity of activation of emotional body sensation absolutely OK. That helps me hone in a little bit more on what are?</p>
<p>Target right have you attempted?</p>
<p>Well, I should say as you know a basic principle in mindfulness is divide and conquer case in point you have divided this experience into OK. There's the emotional body sensations. That's one component. Then there's the muscle reactions to those at the second component, so that's already a divide and conquer and that is already given you some relief that the average person wouldn't experience under comparable circumstances.</p>
<p>As you remember a second axiom is if that, if divide and conquer doesn't work.</p>
<p>Remember, what I always say subdivide until you do conquered in this case have you attempted to break the feel into specific flavors. Anger fear sadness In other words? Have you applied the noting feeling floating feeling flavor technique to this intense arising? Yes, I have? what I have found to be more helpful is.</p>
<p>The investigating.</p>
<p>Where exactly I'm feeling what OK it's a clinching here? What are the boundaries? Is there more pressure in? Is it pushing out you know? am I coming to the more I'm kind of investigating it without necessarily putting a label of the quality. That's been a little more successful in helping me go through it. The that I could tell you the quality the subdivide principle can be applied with regards to either the.</p>
<p>Quality right which is the noting feel flavors so that gives you the spectrum anger fear sadness interest. What have you. But the subdivide principle can also be applied to the spatial aspect of things. So then you're from? Now let's just let it go just could happen during a real session, so divide so you can subdivide into.</p>
<p>Flavors but you can also subdivide into locations. So it's an application of the same principle. So you're saying that sub dividing it by individual body locations has turned out to be more productive your location and quality.</p>
<p>Of sensation you mean so it's a little. Both yes, I never an location getting specific about. Those yeah, so you've already made the major thing that I would first try because you've internalised the algorithms and you say that that does help do you note the location like with the location word face now haven't been doing that out loud?</p>
<p>Been tracking the location and then it sounds like you're staying up for a little. While in a location naming my awareness around inside of inventory kind of what it's like when I'm inside of it. It's so much easier than when I'm outside of it.</p>
<p>For me well that.</p>
<p>Once again sounds like pretty optimal strategy.</p>
<p>Tell me what are the range of flavors involved it's primarily fear flavor primarily to a almost terror panic?</p>
<p>Play sphere an intense fear and there's absolutely sadness. There's absolutely, yeah, is there any reason for it or is it just erupting in the box. I have like? I said I think there was an event or 2 that triggered it on the outside, but this was out of proportion of that and I saw that and as I kind of worked with it, I found that the particular story the surface story.</p>
<p>I yeah, even news, silly, but as as I let go of their needing to be a story. I kind of just wanted to. This quote huge feel an as I've gone down in layers. I'm seeing kind of flickers of like Oh fear of annihilation that I'll be killed in any moment. There's not a logical right in other ways. Internets not really coming from the object of external. I think it taped. I think whatever this was on the outside hula fear tapped.</p>
<p>Everything like a magnet, I think it drew everything up that resonated at that frequency and it's just kind of really throw me at how huge it is an they say in Ohio, you juice was a huge but really it's it's taken all my technique or skill to be functioning, so we're having a huge upwelling of.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Fear potential an sounds like sadness and are they equally strong. The fear in the sadness.</p>
<p>I'd say the fear is probably it's probably like.</p>
<p>The fear is the cake in the sadness is icing that's also going down through the cake food analogy actually that's probably a pretty accurate description because that's what happens they tangle and interact.</p>
<p>And you say very little mental image or internal talked accompanying this first. There was a lot. But as I go down. It's almost pure body? How 'bout very subtle image or talk activation set liminal that balance of some with subliminal stuff is where that Annihilation came up OK that is starting to suggest some strategies. Let me ask you.</p>
<p>Further I say annihilation, but the thing that comes up with big killed like like anybody at any moment could kill you know, and that's all but it's fear and this is good. You've heard me a million times talk about how before we break through. These things they need to become my phrases continuous and ubiquitous.</p>
<p>Continuous means unbroken in time ubiquitous means everywhere in the body.</p>
<p>And we have to going toys, if that's happening, yeah, then a process of.</p>
<p>Permanent purification is happening so people of course.</p>
<p>Are averse to the notion of letting something like fear sadness become continuous through time an Omni directional in the body ubiquitous through the body. But at that Penny Wise and pound foolish because being unwilling to pass through that temporarily keeps them. Always sort of Damocles of fear hanging over their head and likewise with the other negatives like sadness anger and so forth so.</p>
<p>You have to reach a point where it's completely irrational completely over the Top intense.</p>
<p>Doesn't stop in time and is in every cubic centimeter of your body if not of the known universe?</p>
<p>You know In other words, perceived as larger than the body.</p>
<p>And say OK I would allow this to go on forever.</p>
<p>It's at that point that you're getting optimal catharsis in the sense of cleaning out.</p>
<p>So what it's taking awhile but I'm getting a clearer hear me say that makes me feel better.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, not I start work, but you know it's kind of just helpful to have somebody say, 'cause I've just been working on about myself without talking when you want in that it's really helpful to hear it. But just helpful to hear that you know, yeah, I would say that this. This is the stage before People become free.</p>
<p>It's interesting too because when I had a physical issue a year ago, where I had excruciating pain in my body? What happened was it felt like my skin all over my body was burned with singeing very hot and the neurologist. Everybody, said it was probably in response to the pain. They couldn't. They said it's just your bodies into an alarm alert mode. That's getting activated by this fear so like I have that In addition, so you talk about hot Northland.</p>
<p>You know, I've got that on the outside. This kind of thing in that that will definitely that directly corresponds with the intensity of the field, OK, so is that that's enough isn't it?</p>
<p>It's a lot to work with, but actually I need a little more information do you think that it's?</p>
<p>That is interacting with subtle levels of talk or image.</p>
<p>Very very So what do you mean interacting by that I mean that fear?</p>
<p>And sadness might be intensified by.</p>
<p>Subtle subliminal activations of visual or auditory thinking.</p>
<p>What I think is happening and this is just having been working with it now for awhile? I think it's like if there's a deck of cards. That's all the images and thoughts that we have in a pool that one hit something and it went down and if there were like little shavings of metal. I'm sorry. I went back away from deck of cards with shaving all of those came up in each one of those is an image or it could be image or talks stuff, but it's just like in so you might get little flicks like of popcorn, but it might not be enough.</p>
<p>To go Oh yes, that's what that's when I was thoughts exactly and when that comes up. It can poke it can it can it can kind of like add a little little bit of a wood shaving to the fire, but it's like the feel called that up and then that might poke in the feel a little bit. But if I stay with the field. They just kind of hang out so the answer to the question is yes. There is interaction with subtle.</p>
<p>Her Twitch OK is significant, yeah, and also characteristic of Catharsis.</p>
<p>Although it may primarily come up as body feel flavors. Subliminal auditory and visual thinking often enters into the gestalt, especially the visual.</p>
<p>Because People don't usually hear hell they usually see hell.</p>
<p>Although in theory, you can hear it, too, but image spaces where the monsters are.</p>
<p>That might be linked to all of this so that gives me some of the more information that I need OK now believe it or not yet more questions OK. We do as well. We gotta see what's really going on and I don't just doing your house? Yeah, Well, you would be very warehouse. MD is called differential de answer by huge diagnostic skills.</p>
<p>OK, so.</p>
<p>The let's see here.</p>
<p>Have you ever had the experience of having strong fear that was pervasive through the body so dissolve into flow that it no longer cost you suffering.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>How about sadness?</p>
<p>And every done OK, so then you've already done what we're going to be working towards but you're going to be working towards that experience.</p>
<p>Yet again because it's a matter of I mean basically.</p>
<p>What let's see 1234 maybe there's 4 kinds of human beings? I mean there's a lot of ways to classify humans right.</p>
<p>But maybe one way to classify all human beings is.</p>
<p>There is most human beings.</p>
<p>Who have never had the experience of physical pain?</p>
<p>Flowing so completely that.</p>
<p>It turned into a flavor of catharsis rather than a flavor of suffering. Most humans have never had that experience so that's most humans. Then there are the humans that have at least had that experience once.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Then there are the humans that have had that same experience, but with regards to rage terror and more grief.</p>
<p>That's a whole other thing then physical pain.</p>
<p>In terms of what it's like when that breaks up so we've determined and I think harder.</p>
<p>Incomparably, harder because pain is just pain.</p>
<p>The emotional sensations have been honed by evolution to grip us and control us and destroy us. They've been honed by evolution for that task that's what the hell is hell is.</p>
<p>Rage terror grief shame flavors that have become so activated that they are able to.</p>
<p>Convince you</p>
<p>That not only will this be all you ever experienced from now on there actually able to convince you that you never experienced anything else.</p>
<p>There have that much distorting power, so that it seems like eternal in both directions.</p>
<p>That would be helpful.</p>
<p>Purgatory is when.</p>
<p>You've experienced those sensations enough that they can't cause that illusion anymore. But they're still there and you're working with them.</p>
<p>And then</p>
<p>The Inter, the threshold between purgatory and Heaven is when it turns into flow.</p>
<p>We've been talking about so believe it or not one other question besides feared sadness.</p>
<p>Are there hints of any other flavors in there?</p>
<p>Like anger or shame, yeah, I actually look specifically for them. I think the shame flavor.</p>
<p>Can like if something happens in the extra word that embarrasses me? I feel that shame and that can trigger all this.</p>
<p>You know it's irrational it's irrational to the present Bush told the shame flavor or is it pretty much we're dealing with.</p>
<p>Sad and had if we call fear had hasn't had for alliteration. So I could use it. I know you go for it.</p>
<p>'Cause there's mad sad glad and had your changing my feel favors here. It's OK don't come back that will get back to health. Here's what's interesting you know that heat. I talked about in the body. It shares territory with shame and embarrassment in terms of the flush and so it can trigger it.</p>
<p>So they all kind of interlinked in that way. It's all information that I need to do the guidance OK. Let's do it, OK, so take a moment to stretch up and settle in and focus for just a second physical relaxation into the pasture.</p>
<p>OK, we're going to start by working in the fierce sad system.</p>
<p>So at any given.</p>
<p>Instance instant rather, they'll be exactly 1 of 4 states.</p>
<p>Just fear just sad both.</p>
<p>Or another.</p>
<p>We're going to ignore everything else. We're just going to penetrate that one system of affective so much thesia.</p>
<p>My wife talking makes sense.</p>
<p>Quit until the last 2 words, I don't recommend I know Greco Roman for emotional type body sensation King. I love it. Though I know OK, so I'd like you to note fear sad fear an sad or none. One of those for it. You might fear Ansett or both. Let's use fear and said with a boolean.</p>
<p>And and operation so will get the four logically possible states of the fear sadness system.</p>
<p>Any questions about that.</p>
<p>Out loud for stars.</p>
<p>Fear and sad.</p>
<p>Fear and sad.</p>
<p>Fear and sad.</p>
<p>Fear and sad.</p>
<p>Fear and sad.</p>
<p>Now go to mental labels, but thinking the labels rather than speaking.</p>
<p>Is it still mostly both at the same time? Yes take up?</p>
<p>Now we're going to work just with the fear.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>I'm assuming that there is one or more areas of local intensity for the fear is that correct yes is it one or other several disconnected. There's probably one primary one that spreads out and it has little branches to it and then there's.</p>
<p>A little bit of a journey to a secondary one for the most part.</p>
<p>OK, so.</p>
<p>The primary ones spreads branches how bar the primary. One is right at the center of my chest like right in between my rib cage? How broadly are the branches spread through the body.</p>
<p>It kind of comes down around to the side and in there, but it kind of spreads out a bit like like the core center is kind of there in a kind of big odd shape and then there are ways in which I think it kind of reaches suddenly like subtle veins. Kind of going out around to the middle of my back, OK excellent detection skill. I'm assuming that the.</p>
<p>Sutler ramifications are of less intensity? Absolutely. Here's what we're going to do.</p>
<p>We're going to just work with fear each time you note, said I would like you to zoom out.</p>
<p>To the subtle ramifications focus on them, only every 10 minutes. Add I'm sorry every time a note fear OK go out to the subtle ramifications and work towards perfect equanimity with those subtle sensations because there's subtle. It may be possible to have complete openness with them. Even though you can't do so with the local intensities that are at the epicenter of it. So we're going to use the zoom out option on the noting.</p>
<p>You're going to zoom out.</p>
<p>To cover the subtle.</p>
<p>Spread and work towards perfect equanimity with that and don't concern yourself with the local splash at the center at all just with the global ripple in a rhythm with the mental labels of fear.</p>
<p>Word fear any questions about that.</p>
<p>No, you want me, I'll just repeat it back. I'm zooming out. I'm going to keep noting fear with mental labels. But I'm going to when I note fear zoom out to the sutler tributaries, so to speak of the.</p>
<p>Of the experience of fear in my body, not tuning into the.</p>
<p>Main Grand Central Station part of it. It's perfect. And yes, it by mental label. I mean think, to myself fear to indicate that that's the flavor and then you zoom out and then I'm just going to have to do that on your own for a few minutes OK.</p>
<p>Able to do that pretty good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is there any hint?</p>
<p>Our flow in.</p>
<p>The global spread of the fear Oh yeah, it's pretty fluid. Yeah, it flows it, it's interesting.</p>
<p>I kinda be flowing in general, but when I worked with this, it would it first I got like little bits of knowledge. Like I started feeling not other flavors, yeah, and then then a little ticklish. But if I just kind of kept with it those which is.</p>
<p>You know if I just kind of displayed with them dissipate so you're able to get the global component in the fear flavor to flow.</p>
<p>Yeah, OK.</p>
<p>Connect flow spread into the local intensity. After that, you get a local global flow with the fear you know, I think I started to naturally start to do that and I think that's when the nausea started. I think my body. But let's go for local global so that means you'll remember that there's my Standard formulation of the noting technique zoom in zoom out screen freeze. So we're going to zoom both ways out to the perimeter.</p>
<p>To make sensations, there an ride the momentum of a flow. That's there and simultaneously zoom into the core intensity and see if you can get them to get that local splash global ripple.</p>
<p>While keeping the zooming so simultaneously zooming in and out.</p>
<p>Into the core out to the perimeter and you're doing that.</p>
<p>Precisely to facilitate.</p>
<p>The spread of the global.</p>
<p>Flow into the local intensity.</p>
<p>So the awareness is moving in, and around at the same time, it got it. Slight you have a phrase that you came up with the lighting slide, both ways. You're going to slide out with your awareness and let it facilitated global circulation of fear and you're going to slide in and let that.</p>
<p>A facilitate a local circulation of fear, so you get both the intense areas and the peripheral areas.</p>
<p>As a single fear flow.</p>
<p>I will look at little sense of that.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, so that's</p>
<p>That's a catharsis of releasing of fear it creates this kind of center of this.</p>
<p>It's kind of a deep joy that kind of comes up the center, but then I get really hot, yeah, let the joy be there, then the Heat. Be there that these are all really actually stupid Catharsis And if the Heat produces more fear than just dissipate that interfere except that we're going to let go of the fear now and can set.</p>
<p>And don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out what we're going to do right same procedures start with the periphery of these sadness flavor work with that.</p>
<p>See.</p>
<p>If it's amenable through zoom out process to an experience of a global flow.</p>
<p>In the sadness.</p>
<p>If that's feasable do that, and then go in and look for the local flow in the epicenter and you're going to get a local global flow in the sadness if indeed that's</p>
<p>Sort of doable at this time, I'd like you to explore that do ability of that.</p>
<p>With regards to sadness just give it up.</p>
<p>Sometime.</p>
<p>Able to get a little hint of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, since the sadness doesn't have the same vein network of spread. I just kind of instead of since I didn't quite have the subtle area. I just want around the boundaries of that's exactly correct that corresponds to the subtle. It's just less widespread that was made the boundary soft and then treated that that's what I would have had to do so. You're able to get a little sense of that, yeah, OK good now.</p>
<p>I'm going to have you.</p>
<p>Do a fairly intricate concentration.</p>
<p>Where are you going to attempt to experience simultaneous?</p>
<p>Lee.</p>
<p>A kind of River of fear.</p>
<p>And a kind of River of sad.</p>
<p>That flow through each other.</p>
<p>Interpenetrating without interfering.</p>
<p>So it's almost like you say that again Oh yeah right?</p>
<p>There's the sadness flavor and it's a sort of like.</p>
<p>Giant liquid drop that sort of expanding and contracting right right and there's the fear flavor and it's a giant liquid drop doing the same ascential dance now you know how.</p>
<p>Like in ghost movie.</p>
<p>You see that, like the ghost can walk through the wall right right, but goes passes through the wall. The wall gives no resistance. Now imagine you didn't have a ghost in the wall, but you had 2 ghosts.</p>
<p>And they were both.</p>
<p>Doing their own thing.</p>
<p>But they could pass through each other without disturbing each other.</p>
<p>When they occupied the same place at the same time, so you can have these 2 ghostly waves.</p>
<p>One flavored fear the other flavors sad and there, so did dancing except in unlike physical dancers. They parts of them even all of them can occupy the same place.</p>
<p>So they?</p>
<p>They're constantly waving and the waves pass through each other without disturbing each other without developing pressure areas where they would clash does this metaphor makes sense. Yeah.</p>
<p>Have you attempted to do this with the fear and sad not in this not this round. This may be the middle part of the missing piece because you could get them individually default. But then the next step is collectively default because if they both flow at the same time, interpenetrating wherever they need to without interfering then.</p>
<p>They won't multiply together into over well.</p>
<p>And that so the ability to have more than one flavor.</p>
<p>And to separate the flavors have all the flavors flow and then have the flow fields. Interpenetrate without interference is a sequence that I take People through when they're going through big challenges that are.</p>
<p>That are Poly Chromatic.</p>
<p>IMO the Poly Chromatic.</p>
<p>Body distress, meaning a lot of different colors in the body then we need to train. The colors to flow through each other time and into quickly dance, it's an interesting.</p>
<p>Intimacy between them.</p>
<p>It's like they're dancing through each other as well as with each other and to the extent that they're both flowing.</p>
<p>You'll get an even more powerful flavor purification and and hopefully a significantly deeper sense of relief.</p>
<p>Cape Cod House had coming.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>But in Watson.</p>
<p>When I when I allow them both to share the same space and not and I'm recognizing how I've been keeping them separate and keeping the line between them in an when I allow them to just kind of do that kind of joy. I talked about before with the fear it's very intense version of that and then it kind of seems to ignite this kind of.</p>
<p>PT like enerji up the body and it gets very hot, but it's getting it's it's enraptured with fear itself is rather counter intuitive facial expression proves it. Yeah, it's really interesting because, as it does, I find myself wanting to comment on it, and I'll go up and talk and minute and then and then it loses it a little bit, yeah, in yet to come out.</p>
<p>We've done purely in the yeah, it's because the comments and then it does it triggers of little tacos to go visit there all about it in your use of practice allowed you to say that in not sort of go down that yeah well. Press least motivation to kind of stay with this, it's kind.</p>
<p>It's it's intrinsically rewarding no next step. See if you can have the fear in the sadness.</p>
<p>Dancing with, and through each other with your eyes open.</p>
<p>And it may find D focusing the eyes initially.</p>
<p>Helpful.</p>
<p>So we can maintain it somewhat into more ordinary experience.</p>
<p>It's interesting when I.</p>
<p>'Cause I kind of go in and out here as I do it and I'm going to talk all keeping my eyes open, but</p>
<p>I'm getting to where I'm horning in on the one specific place in the body. They both share in a powerful way an if I can just kind of keep track of flow there, letting it be, whether it's red or blue you know.</p>
<p>It.</p>
<p>It kind of helps maintain it with my eyes open market.</p>
<p>And I'll see if you can keep some contact with that.</p>
<p>Even after we make some eye contact.</p>
<p>It may be a little trick here, but</p>
<p>Up this.</p>
<p>Is what we just did here is probably one of the missing pieces in the?</p>
<p>Of the solution to the situation that you described not sure it's all of the missing pieces. I've got a few other ideas. Besides this, but I think for this is a good night for this session, one one. One Epiphany is where half price of admission. I leave that money on the table. The you haven't done this before this well, I remember.</p>
<p>Inter digitation was a word, You used to use and it's so interesting as soon as you guided me on this, I thought.</p>
<p>Oneguide somebody else in this.</p>
<p>I'm glad somebody else in this but I didn't think of it for me. I was just holding remember to do this. You remember to get the flavors to do that. I have other People didn't remember that you could do it for yourself. I was just all my circuits were just so full. I guess or you know that goes to a very general principle in the way I set up my approach to meditation, which is that the assumption is.</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>When People face real challenges.</p>
<p>Even People without a background in practice if you interactively guide them will be able to have pretty dramatic experiences pretty consistently dramatic positive experiences. It is also been my experience that People that are quite good at meditation when they're faced with realize life challenges can easily forget.</p>
<p>But all you need is somebody to do this right. Oh yeah, I knew how to do that, yeah, and then now you're set. You know this is one session. We don't need 20 years of therapy here. It's OK now. You don't know what to do so. I think that's excellent, but I will for subsequent sessions.</p>
<p>Remind me that I had some other ideas of why can actually just tell me now and they're like nicely play it and go member. You gotta finish it so the other thing is that OK one missing piece was well. The 2 flavors have to simultaneously flow and through each other another possible missing piece.</p>
<p>Is that you're getting significant interaction with subliminal thinking?</p>
<p>Right and you might wanna look in that direction and the way you look in that direction. what I was going to have you work through work with is a special exercise that with all the years we've done. I'm not sure we've ever done. This one, but I'll ask you have. We ever done, noting feel sources. What that means is I have note if there's No Fear. You say No Fear if there is fear but it's not triggered by anything you're aware of you say just?</p>
<p>Fear and then you specify if the fear has been triggered by fear from image fear from talk fear from sound field from site or fear from touch. Now we have never built noted fear. I call that noting field sources and field. I mean can be generic or specific that that was the next thing I had in the Hopper to try after this, because what may be happening is that you're getting significant triggering.</p>
<p>From from other senses that are activating the fear in real time and usually what you know how I always say.</p>
<p>OK, what is science in a nutshell? How much of what? When an where interacting in what ways and changing at what rates typically. I emphasize the what the where the rates of change, but some of the special techniques are designed to elucidate the interactions specifically what's triggering Watt and I find that when People are going through significant?</p>
<p>Intractable fear experiences or emotion in general, but especially fear literally a few minutes of noting.</p>
<p>What is triggering that fear in terms of broadly of the broad sensory categories so we could not detect No Fear fear but not a triggered by anything OK? Don't fear fear fear from image fear from talk and especially subtle image and subtle talk, the subliminal stuff. The way you know that's happening is you get a tug twords image space or towards talk space.</p>
<p>No content awareness at all but the next instant. There's a spike in the fear and the body now. You know that the sun. Quite aware of having that yeah, the subconscious well. It turns out if you ask yourself if you constrain yourself in real time to note did it come from image talk sight sound or the physicality of the body 'cause. It's gotta be one of those one of those, 5 right that.</p>
<p>Keeping track of the of the whole system somehow that vastly reduces the over well.</p>
