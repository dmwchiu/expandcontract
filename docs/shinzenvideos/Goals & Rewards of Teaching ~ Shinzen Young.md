So what is the most rewarding thing for you as a teacher.

Not hard to imagine it's seeing progress of People that study with me.

That's the most rewarding thing.

Um.

And that progress takes various forms.

Some People experience little progress little pieces of progress.

Every once in awhile somebody actually has.

A major insight.

So that's what's rewarding for me as a teacher's seeing the progress of the students. I only judge my worth as a teacher in terms of the progress of the student Confucius said not to learn is the students fault.

Not to teach is the teacher's fault.

I disagree.

If.

If the student doesn't learn it's not the students fault.

It's The teachers fault it's my fault.

In other words, it's the job of the teacher to make it possible for the student to learn.

We can't say, Oh well, you don't have the right karma or whatever it's like if they're not getting it. It's on me, it's not on that.

So to find the way to communicate with that, you're talking about communication skills. Well, yes, well so you ask nicely doing a transmission that you asked me what's most most rewarded in general? What's most rewarding is when the students make progress.



If a student happens to have a classical liberation experience.

Now, which happens occasionally the sudden kinds of things.

That of course, is really, really good.

So that's extremely rewarding.

The other rewarding thing is for me.

Is if I can figure out something new something that hasn't been tried before that works like you do on a daily basis is coming up with something new well go around with a notebook.

I mean, I would say that.

Although I've been guiding People for some 35 years I learn something new everyday.

And I take notes on my own process.

And you know every once in awhile I get these epiphanies of creativity with regards to how you can teach People.

And when I get one of those that's really, really good.

That's extremely fulfilling my try it out and it actually works.

My ultimate goal as a teacher is that anything I have personally experienced.

I could lead anybody else to that experience that's what I set for myself as as my goal.

Goodwill.
