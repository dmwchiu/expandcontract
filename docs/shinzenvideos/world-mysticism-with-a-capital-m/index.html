<p>That is the opening lines of the yoga sutras of potentially that mark alluded to.</p>
<p>It's quite extraordinary.</p>
<p>Sutra in the Buddhist sense.</p>
<p>Sometimes generically just means scripture like Chap, the sutras and so forth Poly pronunciation is suit up.</p>
<p>Although in a more specific sense sutra means the discourses of the historical put up to certain section with him. the Buddhist literature. However, within the broader context stuff index civilization. Sutra has a different meaning.</p>
<p>It's a literary form and the point of this literary form is to condense a science into the.</p>
<p>Shortest possible.</p>
<p>Exposition in terms of numbers of syllables.</p>
<p>So the yoga sutras describe what's called Ashtangi Tioga or the 8:00 limbs of yoga. Apron yoga, sometimes called Raja Yoga and you'll also notice that Buddhism is Aria I strongly Buddhism has an 8 fold path also.</p>
<p>Now even the words at the same, the 8:00 elements are not the same but.</p>
<p>Clearly there's influence going back and forth.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>But it says in Sanskrit is.</p>
<p>Yoga is cheap to Brittany Rotor.</p>
<p>It is the cessation of the fluctuations of consciousness.</p>
<p>About the rest are attacked at then and only then.</p>
<p>Does the true observer abide in its nature?</p>
<p>It.</p>
<p>Presents a practice that is very similar in many ways to Buddhism.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it presents a conceptual framework that in some ways, is the diametric officer.</p>
<p>Because it's what we call gone.</p>
<p>Is Nero to that's cessation?</p>
<p>But whereas in Buddhism, it's interpreted as no self.</p>
<p>In.</p>
<p>US Hindu context. It's a particularly in the yoga, sutra context. It's interpreted as the true self the true observer.</p>
<p>If you are just involved in.</p>
<p>Concepts.</p>
<p>Like a scholar.</p>
<p>Or a</p>
<p>Devil teen.</p>
<p>Then it's an endless argument.</p>
<p>Who has the right formulations?</p>
<p>But if you're involved in practice.</p>
<p>You realize that there are many alternative ways to.</p>
<p>Describe.</p>
<p>What we the effects of the practice?</p>
<p>And it is also true that sometimes identical vocabulary.</p>
<p>Is it referring to the same thing at all? So to develop a kind of sensitivity? Where you know that you can detect when the same words refer to something different.</p>
<p>And you can also detect where very different words may refer to very similar things that's.</p>
<p>That takes a little bit of practice.</p>
<p>I was there was a request to.</p>
<p>In the notes for me to talk about Jewish Mysticism Tonight Apropos of Shabbat.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>And I I love to talk about that. But I thought I would frame it in a somewhat larger context and talk about world mysticism.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>And then come Jewish and other ones fitted and how what we do fits him.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>What comes to your mind?</p>
<p>When you hear the English word mysticism.</p>
<p>Something pop into your head.</p>
<p>Oh no mysticism.</p>
<p>What else happened so the same thing doesn't happen so regular People like something very special this is interesting?</p>
<p>Other People what pops into your head and hear that contemplation.</p>
<p>Say goodness.</p>
<p>Now we were mentioning.</p>
<p>The word mysticism. It's got it is am on it, OK that word specifically.</p>
<p>Interesting OK.</p>
<p>Did you say direct experience of truth?</p>
<p>The whole collection of traditions spiritual traditions cool.</p>
<p>Well let me tell you what?</p>
<p>Pops into my head as soon as I hear that word.</p>
<p>All pops into my head is.</p>
<p>Ambiguity it is.</p>
<p>Dangerous to talk about mysticism.</p>
<p>As simply a word.</p>
<p>Without realizing that it is used in 2 very different.</p>
<p>Census.</p>
<p>And the two senses that it is used in is actually rather interesting.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>In the sort of colloquial sense.</p>
<p>It.</p>
<p>Car notes.</p>
<p>New AG.</p>
<p>Realms of power kinds of unusual experiences.</p>
<p>Visions psychic powers that that sort of thing.</p>
<p>But as a technical term that would be used by scholars. Historians People who specialize in academic study of religion.</p>
<p>It refers to something quite different.</p>
<p>It refers to the contemplative Endeavour what we're doing here.</p>
<p>So the first thing, one needs to be careful about if you're having a discussion with someone about quote mysticism.</p>
<p>It is to be sure that you're talking about the same mysticism because.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>You could end up in.</p>
<p>A lot of.</p>
<p>Misunderstanding.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>What's the relationship between the 2:00 meanings of mysticism.</p>
<p>Well, the way that I sort of look at it.</p>
<p>You can think of the Mystical Path.</p>
<p>As a journey from the surface of consciousness to the source of consciousness.</p>
<p>And in making that journey.</p>
<p>You some People encounter some weird unusual stuff.</p>
<p>Um in the intermediate realms between surface and source. The Intermediate Realms are those of the realms of the archetypes. Those are the realms in which gods ghosts ancestors. Angels can actually be experienced.</p>
<p>Sensorial perhaps vividly.</p>
<p>So, in passing from surface to source in going through that intermediate material. Some People or in passing through that intermediate realm. Some People have weird experiences.</p>
<p>That's mysticism with the I call it mysticism with a small amp.</p>
<p>Not everyone who passes from surface to source encounters weird unusual stuff.</p>
<p>But some People do.</p>
<p>Now, when you touch the formless source.</p>
<p>The salient defining characteristic of touching the formula sources that it profoundly changes your notion of who you are.</p>
<p>It's like a paradigm shift.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>That's mysticism with capital M that's the way I describe it.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>As several People mentioned all around the world.</p>
<p>We find actually both kinds of mystical experience.</p>
<p>Oh, the mysticism with a capital M is of course, what we're mostly interested in here.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Many People.</p>
<p>Mystical experience in that sense comes about as the result of systematic practice. However, it is important to realize that sometimes People come to these experiences without any formal practice at all.</p>
<p>It just happens.</p>
<p>Couldn't maybe once or twice a year I get an email from someone who had done any meditation.</p>
<p>Uh but just one day like one person put it one day I was just big or another one day.</p>
<p>In all the world at myself became paper thin.</p>
<p>And there, but not there.</p>
<p>And and it's permanent.</p>
<p>It just happens.</p>
<p>Now that indicates to me that this is a natural phenomenon.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The other thing that indicates to me that it's a natural In other words, the fact that it just happens without cultivation to People.</p>
<p>The other thing that indicates to me that it's a natural phenomenon is the relative universality of.</p>
<p>Baba booey contemplative or mystical practice around the world.</p>
<p>So if you take the yoga sutras for example, it divides into these 8.</p>
<p>Uh steps.</p>
<p>Yama Niyama Asana Pranayama Pratiharas Deanna Semantic.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>The first couple steps are about religious customs and ethics sort of like getting your act together as a human being in terms of character.</p>
<p>And that roughly Maps on to what in Buddhism is called Sheila.</p>
<p>And that also Maps on to the first few stages of Saint Theresa's model.</p>
<p>Which is in a book called last moradas the interior Castle?</p>
<p>It starts with this sort of like working on your behavior working on your issues that kind of thing.</p>
<p>All that in the in the yoga sutras yet proceeds through up and force. This is what makes the index system in some way superior to the western system. It talks about Ossama Proma, so that means working with the breath and postures.</p>
<p>That the notion that posture has an impact on consciousness was not appreciated in western mysticism. The way it was in the E.</p>
<p>OK, so then.</p>
<p>I'm going to skip some details but.</p>
<p>Then you go through a sequence of ever deepening concentration.</p>
<p>And that's also what's in Teresa's interior Castle after you so they got their act together.</p>
<p>Then she gives many benchmarks over many years decades of developing more and more concentration power.</p>
<p>Now the yoga sutras describe the same thing.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>And it's that corresponds roughly to the Buddhist Johnna System, the absorption system.</p>
<p>So we can see that these Maps in general will have a component of working on your character. They have a component of building concentration power?</p>
<p>Then they'll have a component.</p>
<p>Of something else.</p>
<p>But here's where things could get very confusing vocabulary Wise.</p>
<p>Because in Buddhism.</p>
<p>That something else is looked upon as a kind of transformation of consciousness, a new way of understanding who you are.</p>
<p>And it's called crunch, yeah, so in Buddhism, it proceeds. Sheila some anti personnel.</p>
<p>When you read Saint Teresa, her interior Castle proceeds exactly the same way.</p>
<p>Work on yourself as a person then all these different stages of ever deepening absorption and then what's amazing is to read very late in life?</p>
<p>She had this experience.</p>
<p>Of.</p>
<p>And you can see that she's struggling to convey.</p>
<p>How different it is from everything she experienced before?</p>
<p>And she refers to it as an intellectual vision, OK, but she says that that's not really what I'm talking about because it wasn't a vision.</p>
<p>And it's not intellectual, but something shifted and the salient feature of that.</p>
<p>Was that?</p>
<p>Well, the way that she put it.</p>
<p>The Self forgetting is so great.</p>
<p>That, it seems as though the soul no longer exists.</p>
<p>I mean, anyone with the Buddhist background immediately sees.</p>
<p>Insight into know so and it's permanent.</p>
<p>It's permanent.</p>
<p>But along with the paradigm of nothingness.</p>
<p>Comes also the paradigm of Oneness, there related.</p>
<p>So she also describes this experience as she says the?</p>
<p>The The Oneness with with God is like.</p>
<p>The wonders of water in water.</p>
<p>Now she's writing in the 16th century. She's actually writing for the Inquisition. You know that they would.</p>
<p>Approve what she had to say 'cause, yet that like get everything passed right by the thought. Police Catholic Europe and it had no difficulty passing in fact, it became the standard model used by the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>To this day.</p>
<p>And when I first read this and I saw my God, this like mats on.</p>
<p>Quite so clearly to Buddhist experience. It totally blew my mind because this is 16th century Spain. This is a completely different world while I should this.</p>
<p>Mount bond is something that someone wrote in 6 century, Shree Lanca.</p>
<p>These worlds had no contact whatsoever.</p>
<p>And yet they're describing roughly similar map so that's mysticism with a capital L.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>What's good? What could be a little confusing is?</p>
<p>That in the yoga sutras, they don't explicitly talk.</p>
<p>About the wisdom function as being in some some way different from the concentration process.</p>
<p>However, it's implied in there.</p>
<p>The steps it the last three steps in yoga or call Donna Dianah Semantic.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>So Donna means holding that's the stage in concentration where?</p>
<p>Your attention Wanders and you have to bring it back your attention. Wanders and you have to bring it back. You've probably noticed that states that start on that.</p>
<p>Johno.</p>
<p>Your attention doesn't wander anymore.</p>
<p>It the description in the yoga sutras is that it's like an unbroken stream of Sesame. E oil when you pour oil OK. If there's a continuity there. So, your whatever your object of focus is your attention stays there.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>That's called job.</p>
<p>That is the word that corresponds to Poly Word JAMA and clearly there's a relationship, although they don't. It's not exact one for one correspondence, but they're pointing to similar general directions.</p>
<p>Then there's the final stage in the yoga path Roger Dover Path.</p>
<p>Is called Samadi OK so remember I said?</p>
<p>The trick is to know when the same word refers to different things have been different words refer to the same thing OK could be very tricky to have the sensitivity to be able to.</p>
<p>Smell what's going on?</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I've I've seen endless arguments between yoga People and Buddhists.</p>
<p>About somebody.</p>
<p>So my knees where it's at so he's not where it's at somebody is where it's at somebody's not working.</p>
<p>Not realizing that they're not really talking about.</p>
<p>Quite the quite the same thing it's confusing because it's the same syllables.</p>
<p>And it's closely related.</p>
<p>But not exactly the same it within the Buddhist context. While I showed you the 3 steps in Buddhism, she loved somebody progeria.</p>
<p>That's called the traineeship shining the threefold training. It's away another way of organizing the Eightfold Path.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>So within this context and in general within Buddhism.</p>
<p>As a general principle, Samadi is a generic TER.</p>
<p>Anything from a light.</p>
<p>Focus to a concentrated state so profound that you don't need to move for days.</p>
<p>Add your Physiology is so altered that.</p>
<p>He might be mistaken for dead.</p>
<p>OK anything along that whole continuum in Buddhism is called somebody. But in the yoga sutras only the deepest part is referred to that some anti.</p>
<p>And there's actually 2 kinds of somebody distinguished in the older system.</p>
<p>There is</p>
<p>Somebody just somebody and nearly just somebody.</p>
<p>Somebody with a seed and somebody with policy.</p>
<p>So what is the seed a seed is a sensory object that you're focusing on?</p>
<p>So let's say for example, that you were focusing on.</p>
<p>Music you wanted to make music your path to enlightenment.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Your.</p>
<p>You start listening to music, I went through a period of about 3 years where I was like really bored with meditation and the only way I can get myself interested was by listening to classical music.</p>
<p>But at least it's sort of kept me going you know, so you're listening to the music and your attention. Wanders and you bring it back your attention wanted you. Bring up that at some point your attention doesn't wander so much anymore.</p>
<p>Then, at some point, so that you know bring it back that starner.</p>
<p>It doesn't wander anymore. It just stays there. That's down not in the Yoda sense of the word job.</p>
<p>But then you can have this experience, where there's just the music.</p>
<p>And no sense of and I listening to the music.</p>
<p>You become the music.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>That's somebody just somebody well.</p>
<p>How does that come about from the paradigm that?</p>
<p>We've been using here it's simple.</p>
<p>There's only so much real estate in consciousness.</p>
<p>If 100% of the awareness is going into the music that leaves zero awareness to go back to see in here in Feelin.</p>
<p>OK, so.</p>
<p>The.</p>
<p>So it's identical to Sasaki Roshi's.</p>
<p>To the first part of Sasaki Roshi's Co op? How do you become free from yourself when you see the flow?</p>
<p>Well, he wants you to have a visual experience of just site.</p>
<p>And no reactive self.</p>
<p>So that's something just Ahmadi.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>It's essentially well. Yeah.</p>
<p>That's what but there's there's beach. Uh there's there is a sensory event there. There's just.</p>
<p>All of the all of the attention.</p>
<p>Is allocated to that sensory event and back? Where there would have been a self? Where there would have been seeing here in feeling there. There isn't that there's just the sea out where the hero. But you still seeing a flower you're still hearing the music sound.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>A deeper experience.</p>
<p>Is near be just semantic?</p>
<p>Some anti without are seed.</p>
<p>That's formless amounting.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>What in the world is that?</p>
<p>That is Samadi I'm gone.</p>
<p>That is cheaper, it in errata that is the cessation of the fluctuations of consciousness.</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p>Have such a complete experience of the sea out of the flower or they hear out of the music that there's no fixating of the site or the sound into a thing.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>There's just the Godness.</p>
<p>Of.</p>
<p>The cider sound.</p>
<p>And there's just the godness of the self and they are the same baldness.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>As I say in.</p>
<p>In the yoga sutras that is described in terms of semantic.</p>
<p>Whereas in Buddhism, it would be described in terms of insight into no self and emptiness.</p>
<p>So that's the source of the argument between Buddhist at the yoga, yoga practitioners. It's an inability to realize that.</p>
<p>Sometimes the same word is used in different ways.</p>
<p>And sometimes different words are used to point to essentially similar things so if you attain.</p>
<p>Near be just somebody you have also obtained.</p>
<p>BAE call an abiding.</p>
<p>Contact with gone.</p>
<p>Well, not exactly in a biting contact you can't have binding contact.</p>
<p>You can only.</p>
<p>Have a self that returns.</p>
<p>And looks back and knows that an instant before it was one with everything it was 1.</p>
<p>In uh nothing.</p>
<p>Experience but that's the re occuring of a self enlightenment is actually a kind of self. I know that's like hugely confusing. When I first heard Sasaki well, she say that enlightenment is a kind of stuff. It's like Oh wait a minute. That's totally contrary to what Buddhism says in like? What is no self right well.</p>
<p>Enlightenment is is an experience of no self, but in the moment of experiencing gone.</p>
<p>Or near be just some ality.</p>
<p>In the moment of experiencing that there's no experience are so there's actually no conscious awareness of it.</p>
<p>But a second later.</p>
<p>Uh a self returns.</p>
<p>And it has seeing here in Phelim that represent.</p>
<p>The no self experience that it just had and as the years and decades proceed.</p>
<p>That returning of the self.</p>
<p>Um as an enlightened self.</p>
<p>It becomes clearer and clearer and clearer it has a clearer mental image. It has clearer way of being able to describe and it has clearer emotions.</p>
<p>Around the experience of no self that it just had.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>In the yoga tradition, the goal is to attain Sajas Ahmadi. That's at least according to some of the books. What is saja. Meanwhile, sajer means on the natu natural so in this case it means in daily life, it means as you're bopping around in the world.</p>
<p>Thousands of times a day.</p>
<p>You have an experience of.</p>
<p>The one that is the nothing the completeness that is.</p>
<p>The sensation.</p>
<p>And then you have a clear experience of coming from that.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>And you know where you just came from.</p>
<p>And you know exactly what your job is.</p>
<p>Ah, how how to get back.</p>
<p>How you get back is by not trying to get back but by completely affirming saying yes to the re arising of the personal self.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>This is equivalent to.</p>
<p>In our system.</p>
<p>The.</p>
<p>Working with gone M and seeing how.</p>
<p>I come from in return to that moment by moment.</p>
<p>But it's not formulated as I say in terms of a wisdom or an insight quite as quite specifically so it can be confusing was very confusing to me 'cause I thought well.</p>
<p>The yoga system just culminates in in high concentration, it doesn't culminate in enlightenment.</p>
<p>So it's inferior to the Buddhist Formulation, but then later on, I realized that that was just an artifact of the language and the way things are described.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Um all around the world.</p>
<p>There is both mystical experience with the small M, the new AG sort of Mystical SH. Mystical rubble power stuff and then there is mystical experience with the big camp.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>But the different traditions might the components as far as I can see are all the same components are always there, but they may be language differently or there may be a different emphasis that obscures the fundamental similarity.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>In the Christian Mystical tradition.</p>
<p>Oh, and I should say well, what are the components? What are the universal components? Well, I just gave you 1 formulation? Which is she let semantic prochnow so you work on yourself and you develop high concentration and then you have something that in Buddhism is described as going beyond concentration and also Saint Teresa of Avila described it that way it's going.</p>
<p>Beyond concentration states it's a change in your your paradigm about.</p>
<p>What you are what you're made of literally?</p>
<p>But in the the yoga system. It's just called new beaches, Samadi and you might not realize you might think Oh that's just.</p>
<p>More concentration, but if you attain cheetah Virginia Rhoda, the cessation of the fluctuations of consciousness. Whether you talk about it in those terms or not your paradigm your model for what self is will change and there will be a wisdom component. There so one way to look at at what's universal? Is there's work, you do?</p>
<p>On yourselves for years, so there's there's sort of like work you do too.</p>
<p>Improve yourself.</p>
<p>Then there is always a description of the sequence of stages of concentration and then there is.</p>
<p>Well, in Buddhism is described as that which goes beyond concentration where you gain an insight, which in Buddhism is called emptiness or no self.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Within the Christian way of working.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>The generic term for the states of high concentration is recollection, meaning not to remember but to collect back OK rain means back com means together and leg are a means to pick up or together. So Recollect Dio in Ordinary, English, it means to remember but as a technical term in Christian contemplative.</p>
<p>Usage recollection means what we in Buddhism called Samonte.</p>
<p>But if that recollection is.</p>
<p>Up is very deep, it's called infused contemplation and that pretty much corresponds to Tiana. That kind of thing, so very deep experience. Now, one of the things that's a little bit confusing.</p>
<p>Is that?</p>
<p>There is</p>
<p>A link between concentration, which is simply the ability to.</p>
<p>Hold the focus there's a link between concentration and calming and tranquility, and indeed in the Buddhist system. There is a term shamatha in Sanskrit or psamathe in Poly that has both of those connotations. It mean it literally shum is means to tranquilize.</p>
<p>Uh and Top means to fix it OK, so it's trying it as a single word that connotes both the tranquilizing aspect.</p>
<p>And the concentration aspect that's why in Tibetan Shamatha was translated as she name.</p>
<p>She means tranquil near means abiding OK, meaning you're able to hold the focus where you want. However, strictly speaking, but calming aspect and the concentrating aspect, although there are obviously very related they are not identical things.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>But you need calming is common OK but you need some com in order to be able to hold the focus Conversely if you're going to hold the focus things tend to mellow out a little bit. But in my way of thinking they're not identical. That's why all the techniques that I teach you have concentration, but the focus on rest technique emphasizes the calming or tranquilizing aspect.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Within the Christian way of working the tranquilizing aspect is very much emphasized and so another term that's used is prayer of quiet.</p>
<p>Or at your quiz.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>The emphasis is on getting into these deep tranquil, States and the paradigm for what happens in those deep triangle states is the sole unites with God.</p>
<p>And that is certainly a legitimate paradigm that's a way to think about it.</p>
<p>On.</p>
<p>Within the Islamic mystical way of working we find the same elements.</p>
<p>What's Islamic mysticism called?</p>
<p>Sufism.</p>
<p>So we find the same elements.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>The paradigm for what happens.</p>
<p>Is also similar?</p>
<p>What is supposed to happen is something called phenac?</p>
<p>FANA.</p>
<p>And what that means in Arabic is.</p>
<p>Nero to it means it means annihilation.</p>
<p>So the sense of personal self.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Is seen through Anaya lated an one experiences phenom phila? Which means disappearance of the something this of self that allows you to melt into other into God.</p>
<p>So let me see.</p>
<p>Something roughly similar to the Christian paradigm sort of like.</p>
<p>Merging with God concept.</p>
<p>What about Jewish mysticism well Jewish mysticism has 2 paradigms?</p>
<p>One is something called Devette Coot.</p>
<p>Or in the Ashkenazic Pronunciation Vegas. You know that there's 2 there's 2 pronunciations of Hebrew.</p>
<p>I was right on the transition my.</p>
<p>First Hebrew classes when I was a kid, we learned the Eastern European pronunciation, then, when Israel achieve statehood.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>And decided to go with the Safar **** so that they they shifted if my synagogue and I'd like thriller. The whole thing again and suck that bad but it really didn't. It didn't sound like he poop, but anyway, so divine quote is the proper Safar. **** Israeli pronunciation. And that could is I guess it would be written in English DEVE.</p>
<p>KUT.</p>
<p>That's the one most paradigm OK, so that is there.</p>
<p>And it's talked about and the idea is that you can achieve their coot with anything OK. If you fully focus on anything that you're doing, you can have this sense of this, it becomes a merging experience.</p>
<p>But there's another paradigm that's used in Jewish mysticism that I personally find extremely interesting.</p>
<p>Because.</p>
<p>It's you don't see anything like it in.</p>
<p>Christian mysticism, you don't see anything like it in Islamic mysticism.</p>
<p>This second parent Lee.</p>
<p>But where you do, find this second paradigm.</p>
<p>Is?</p>
<p>In Sasaki Roshi's formulation of Buddhism.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Years ago, I am I was in Montreal. We were having a Sachin's then retreat at this, then center that.</p>
<p>Is like half of Leonard Cohen's house? He was born in Montreal in so he gave half of his house that he owns there to make a Zen Center and then he kept the other half.</p>
<p>To leave him so he and I were staying in the half, where he lives and so I like woke up one morning and.</p>
<p>He was like studying looking at the town would OK.</p>
<p>And so I started said you know what?</p>
<p>What are you doing and he said well?</p>
<p>These Thomas that's like you know the Jewish sort of.</p>
<p>I'll be darn I guess you could send him to mix metaphors, he said.</p>
<p>These guys.</p>
<p>We're trying to get to what no sheet is teaching or something to that effect.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>There is this paradigm of.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Bryza Yesh MetLife.</p>
<p>That as I say among the western forms of mysticism.</p>
<p>As far as I know only Judaism has this one. So Judaism has the merging with God that could thing that as I say is so characteristic of the other Abrahamic religions Christianity Islam, But.</p>
<p>Judaism as this other thing and this other thing is actually the main paradigm.</p>
<p>What does briand aschman iron mean well Bree are means creation?</p>
<p>Yesh means existence.</p>
<p>Or something.</p>
<p>Or self as all of those connotations.</p>
<p>And mappings from.</p>
<p>And I and means divine nothingness.</p>
<p>So how is it that?</p>
<p>The infinite sum things.</p>
<p>Of self and world.</p>
<p>Arise from the one.</p>
<p>Very special nothing.</p>
<p>That is God.</p>
<p>To understand clearly that process.</p>
<p>Is the central goal of Jewish mysticism?</p>
<p>I remember years ago, having here in La having lunch with hot bod rabbi which is a form of quote Ultra Orthodox.</p>
<p>Um and I said sum it up for me.</p>
<p>What's your trip about I don't think I use the word trip It was something like OK, you lay it on Main.</p>
<p>What's what's the?</p>
<p>What's the final goal here? Is he said. Well, the final goal is in ordinary life.</p>
<p>Up to be able to in each moment of experience.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Experience how that moment is coming from and returning to.</p>
<p>God and one.</p>
<p>One way that that's formulated is what I just said Pre Aisha Iron.</p>
<p>Another way that it's formulated is in the phrase Shifty Ha Shem Lanik D tommyd?</p>
<p>This is really, really interesting.</p>
<p>Phrase in Hebrew. I spent actually literally an entire morning in Israel with one of the Top biblical scholars. I mean, secular type. Scholars objective scholars on on the Hebrew language.</p>
<p>Discussing she just like filled in all of these.</p>
<p>Rich connotations of the phrase that I just said in Hebrew, So what it means is.</p>
<p>Literally.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>You can't even translate it into English, but it means to.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>To always equate.</p>
<p>What is in front of you?</p>
<p>With God,</p>
<p>So what does it mean to equate?</p>
<p>Well, there's a superficial way that that's done in Jewish mysticism. And then there's a deep way that that stop.</p>
<p>The superficial way is that you use the associations of the Hebrew language.</p>
<p>To constantly have things remind you conceptually of God.</p>
<p>So that's a sort of intellectual way of trying to be thinking about God all the time.</p>
<p>But from that's just the beginning of continuous contact, though the deeper experience is not sort of using all of these associations. It's not this intellectual endeavor, it's a perceptual endeavor.</p>
<p>So the deeper, meaning of shifty ha. Shem Lennick Detombe need to have God in front of your eyes. All the time is to like literally have God in front of your eyes, so that means that you're experiencing what's quote in front of your eyes and In other words? What's in your senses what you see here and contact for your body you're experiencing the inner part of that itself and the outer part the world your.</p>
<p>Experiencing that coming from and returning to the source moment by moment.</p>
<p>In order to be able to have that experience how is that achieved?</p>
<p>Well, you have to be willing to go through a process called Betul High Ish.</p>
<p>Which in Hebrew means the annihilation of the something this within you sound familiar?</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Then you're gifted.</p>
<p>Um or put in our terms.</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p>Have to see.</p>
<p>The Golan of self and world.</p>
<p>Many many, many, many, many times.</p>
<p>Before, you start to.</p>
<p>Have a clearer perception of how that gone.</p>
<p>Manifest.</p>
<p>How that nothing manifests all the one nothing manifests the myriad somethings?</p>
<p>Of self and world.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Does that occur?</p>
<p>Well, according to the Jewish Formulation in Coppola.</p>
<p>It occurs through the the IT, meaning the manifestation of self and world.</p>
<p>It occurs through an interplay of two forces why am I not surprised.</p>
<p>Hazard and glue ha has it is affirmation.</p>
<p>Expansion.</p>
<p>Hula is negation contraction.</p>
<p>And Uhm.</p>
<p>In between.</p>
<p>These 2 there is something called Simpson they pull apart.</p>
<p>And they create a cleft.</p>
<p>And in that cleft.</p>
<p>Self and world arise moment by moment so this should sound rather similar.</p>
<p>It is utterly extraordinary to me.</p>
<p>That Sasaki Roshi's paradigm map song.</p>
<p>This closely with the kabbalistic POV because, although he's well studied within the Buddhist tradition.</p>
<p>I'm I I know I I am sure he has no knowledge of the Jewish meditative tradition and certainly the Jewish meditative tradition. That was formulated centuries and centuries ago in Europe and the Middle East never heard of Sasaki Roshi.</p>
<p>So it's like it blows my mind, how similar it is.</p>
<p>With so.</p>
<p>Within the Buddhist tradition if you've ever studied them you probably learned the heart sutra OK. This is a famous.</p>
<p>Sutra out there in the sense of scripture that chanted.</p>
<p>And the lines go Congees Ibella Saga Logian on ya. Haha mythology show can cone. Kaiku Dory Cycle, Yahoo Charlie. She she carefully cuckoo. Felicia OK OK. So when the body suffer of a low key taste far I was practicing Prochnow para meter.</p>
<p>He slash she clearly saw that all the.</p>
<p>That the 5:00 aggregates are empty and that that was the secret for passing beyond all suffering and then have a little taste for it begins to speak to Sharon Poutre. So who is Shariputra Shariputra was the historical Buddha's chief disciple.</p>
<p>And Shariputra is associated with the uh be Dharma and the Abbey Dharma is this formulation in Buddhism that classifies.</p>
<p>The world and sensory experience.</p>
<p>With the point of view of.</p>
<p>That you can if you sort of untangle these elements. You'll be able to become free so that's actually very true but the problem is that at some point. People started to just read the Abbey Dharma and not practice meditation and they they equated learning these lists of categories with enlightenment.</p>
<p>So then Mahama arose by way of reaction.</p>
<p>An and said Hey just learning these lists of elements isn't going to enlighten you. You have to have a correct experience of should get of emptiness.</p>
<p>So all the look he takes for representing the Miana POV.</p>
<p>Speaks to shariputra representing the sort of Scholastic Hinayana POV, an what does valocchi taste far is saying he says.</p>
<p>Shiki Phooey Cuckoo Phooey shaking.</p>
<p>Form.</p>
<p>Is?</p>
<p>Uh form is emptiness emptiness is form.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>The Zen People.</p>
<p>Riff on that line big time because.</p>
<p>Of the way it's phrased form is emptiness emptiness is form.</p>
<p>When does M teacher gives a tracial on that portion of the scripture inevitably.</p>
<p>They will say that.</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p>Summarizes.</p>
<p>The entire path.</p>
<p>And that the phrase form is emptiness, she keep who EKU and the phrase Koo Huy Shiki.</p>
<p>Emptiness is not different from 4:00 that these are 2 sides to the practice.</p>
<p>Form is emptiness is Betul High Ish.</p>
<p>It's the experience of the annihilation of something nahs.</p>
<p>In terms of our system it's flowing go.</p>
<p>OK, it's dissolving back into Floanne Nirodha cessation.</p>
<p>Form is emptiness, but then that's only half of enlightenment.</p>
<p>The other half is to understand.</p>
<p>In specific.</p>
<p>How emptiness manifest form?</p>
<p>Form is emptiness emptiness is form.</p>
<p>So how does emptiness manifest form?</p>
<p>Well originally there is 0.</p>
<p>But 0 is inherently unstable.</p>
<p>Because there is no actual 0.</p>
<p>0 is just what comes about when all the Yeses and all the nose needed to create this or any conceivable universe all balance and cancel.</p>
<p>That's why the nothingness of the Mystic is a rich nothingness because it contains.</p>
<p>Infinite positive and negative in a cancelled out condition. So originally there is nothing but nothing but there actually isn't a nothing.</p>
<p>There's just the canceling of affirmation and negation.</p>
<p>So nothing is inherently unstable and it breaks apart.</p>
<p>And part of it only knows to affirm and that expense and the other part only knows to the gate and that contracts.</p>
<p>And that creates a cleft which is the time space volume for each moment of sensory experience.</p>
<p>This is how society or she describes.</p>
<p>The passage from emptiness 24.</p>
<p>And it happens to be as far as I can see the way that the Jewish Mystics describe it. and I haven't seen this description anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>That blows my mind, said well this is really cool.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Been up been off.</p>
<p>Means to know in the sense of separating things.</p>
<p>To make discriminates discriminative noise.</p>
<p>Dodd is to know in the biblical sense to know in a penetrating park.</p>
<p>Like you know by it's like carnal knowledge EU.</p>
<p>You have soaked into the thing that's the Top and a hallmark is the wisdom.</p>
<p>That is a spiritual paradigm shift its enlightenment.</p>
<p>That's exactly the 3:00 meanings in the word vipasa MA.</p>
<p>We personal means to separate out the strands vipasana to see separate but Vipasana also means vipasana to see through or into.</p>
<p>So I teach you how to separate the strands of experience and then how to let your awareness soak into them so that you can see that they're just made out of vibrating space.</p>
<p>Expansion contraction bolds, the moment by moment and if you see that clearly enough you have.</p>
<p>V Pasola in the sense of insight.</p>
<p>Or wisdom.</p>
<p>So, in Poly Vipasana in Sanskrit Depressional. It's one word with three connotations.</p>
<p>In the Hebrew language. They actually have 3 words for each these each of these kinds of not one for each of these kinds of knowing but they yes combine it into a single acronym. At least with this particular group of Ultra Orthodox Jews. It's come up that's what they're about so once again the the.</p>
<p>Parallels rather striking.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>When I have lunch and I said, OK, what is it?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>You know what's your thing about you, said well reallocation that I am.</p>
<p>Through beetle high edge to to annihilate the something Ness of self, which will then allow you to experience.</p>
<p>A special nothingness.</p>
<p>So that's the part of the path that is form is emptiness and the Orthodox way of praying.</p>
<p>Where you its body player, you move OK the idea is that you're trying to become like a flame without any fixation whatsoever.</p>
<p>And hopefully at some point in that process. God will blow out the flame.</p>
<p>Which is exactly Nirvana now isn't that exactly what that means the fling it's worn out so the actual that Orthodox Jewish body prayer that I love so much better than mine prayer.</p>
<p>Is that's the whole goal here actually trying to be like move like a flame and become so flowing that at some point, it will get blown out and you'll experience between my age, so that's</p>
<p>The part of the path, which in terms of our system is.</p>
<p>Sort of related to the gods right.</p>
<p>Then so but in Zen Formulation that she keep phooey coup that's form is empties.</p>
<p>Then when that becomes clear then you can see the other side of the picture.</p>
<p>How it is that that gone?</p>
<p>Breaks apart.</p>
<p>And vibrates self and world into existence and you know where you just came from.</p>
<p>Now that person that knows where it just came from and knows where the world just came from Sensorially That's called an enlightened person.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>So that the goal, according to this rabbi was you.</p>
<p>Heroically.</p>
<p>Throw caution to the wind.</p>
<p>And let the source and I'll link to something is within you.</p>
<p>AB tool high edge as the result of that you'll be gifted in daily life.</p>
<p>With.</p>
<p>Bree I ishma iron.</p>
<p>And as the result of living your life that way.</p>
<p>You optimally contribute to something called Tick **** Obama.</p>
<p>The mending of the world.</p>
