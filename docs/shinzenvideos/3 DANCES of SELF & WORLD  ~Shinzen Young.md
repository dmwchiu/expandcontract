So what we have here is.

Summary of

Self in the world's 3 dances.

Plus, the still point.

There is the dance of our humanity, which is A3 jobs.

Appreciate self in world get over the self and world improve the self in the world.

All right.

Tools for doing those jobs are.

Our attentional skills concentration sensory clarity equanimity.

Those skills are applied to and cultivated within.

Are visual auditory and somatic sensory experience?

Here we have the dance of nature.

From expansion contraction interplay in implied by Planck's constant at the very small level of things.

This is the Friedman.

Equation.

Cosmic density.

Which is the interplay of?

Expensive matter and contractive metal expensive matter energean contracted matter Energi.

That determine the ultimate size and shape of the universe and so forth.

This stands for numerous structures in between the largest and the smallest that.

Have.

Can be looked upon as having expensive contractive?

Enter play like a star is.

Formed by the interplay of.

The outwardly directed photon pressure from the heat and the inwardly directed force of self gravity, and numerous scales.

We see this.

So this is sort of the dance of expansion contraction contrast with in the material world or nature.



And that's reflected by mutually canceling polarities within the mathematics of the complex number field.

Which allows for addition?



Scaling which is multiplication by a real real number and sort of Twirling, which is imaginary exponentiation or Fazer.

This is the stretch squeeze aspect of generalized, multiplication and this is the turn to the right turn to the left, which called a Fazer. Fazer aspect of multiplication, which is the Twirling.

And this is the.

This is like a dancer that you know moves forward moves backwards stretches out pulls in toils to the right turns to the left so we have this abstract dance.

Of the numbers.

And we have the?

The material the dance of nature itself.

Time space matter and energy.

And then we have our senses.

And our sensory attention skills.

Which allow us to do the human dance?

This was put in a center in the center is the still point of the turning world.



Which is the source?

Of all of it.

And this is.

A way of.

Summarizing in a modern way.

What I would characterize as the pythagorean agenda?

Pythagoras had this revolutionary idea lived around the same time that the book done did.

I could be off by century or so, but roughly.

You know, 5th 6th century BC that kind of thing.

This revolutionary idea.

Bet.

The endeavor of the human soul.

And.

The nature of nature.

And the nature of number or a single unity.

And so.

This is a modern way to think about.

Um.

I.

Vindicating the pythagorean agenda.

And down here 3 dances.

3 dances in the still quite.

What sort of cool is that?

The Pythagorean's.

We're often represented.

By the pentagram the 5:00 pointed star that's where this all comes from.

So.





This is all Maj to my.

Ancestors already Israelites so we have.

We have the

The Greeks and the Semites all this 3 dances.

3 dancers at the still point of the turning world.

Neither movement from North Taurids.

At the still point there, the dances.

But do not call it fix a T.

Where past and future are gathered?

If not for the point.

The still point.

There would be no dance.

And there is only the dance.
