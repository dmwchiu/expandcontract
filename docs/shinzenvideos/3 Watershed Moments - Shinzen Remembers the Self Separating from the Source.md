There is the very instant when something starts.

Um.

And.

That's the primordial perfection of the source acting.

And that is the world that we lived in.

In infancy.

I have vague recollections of that time sake and years of practice to to remember.

What it was like I remembered?

Free watersheds.

I have a vague recollection of when I was just expanding contracting effortless space.

Instead of having object defied experience of self and world I can remember that I can remember discovering.

The power of crying.

That if I cried.

That like I would get this attention, but that was like really like major epiphany and then I remember this horrible horrible thing happening.

And it just sort of came on it, came out of nowhere.

And it just came on like gangbusters.



I started to worry about this.

I started to have thoughts.

And fears.

Um.

And I don't know how old you know, but I'm.

Imagining.

234 something like that.

And it was like What is this? This this wasn't here before.

And suddenly I was worried and afraid and thinking about stuff well. That was the arising of the inner system S itself.

And I can remember it coming on and it's like? What is this? What's happening to me.

It's like white why am I scared and thinking of course. I didn't have those words for it. But in retrospect. So I could remember those watershed, so we can go back.

As adults with our adult competency.

And at the best of both worlds. We can experience because the our first world is never really lossed our very first world quick now here now always.

Always the condition of complete simplicity.
