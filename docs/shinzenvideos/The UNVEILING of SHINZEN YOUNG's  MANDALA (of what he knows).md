It's pretty isn't it?

Now like I say you can't see the symbols from where you are even if you have a good vision, but.

And then pass out something that you can look at but.

Here it is.

Here is your senses.

Write your conduct.

A life treats you.

And the answer to the question what is mindfulness concentration clarity equanimity?

Why practice mindfulness total human happiness?

What's in? How do you practice mindfulness techniques?

Daily cycle yearly cycle daily cycle have a good time. What's the history of mindfulness show monic. Prius prehistoric show monic origins, historic meditative traditions? Present research also blamed new Donovan New Age.

Uh.

This is the basics what why where when now the details details on Watt.



What is concentration?

Well, I've given all the lectures. I'm not going to go into it. But you know, there's is what it is what it is it instances, the deep view and the taste and the same information for sensory clarity and the same information for equanimity details notice. It lines up wonder one details about this you store here.

Details about this There's the noting board.

There's the focus on positive board iconographically represented positive affect is smiling positive behaviors legs positive. Cognition is a brain ideal or archetype is holy figure positive situation is a dawn similar to this, but then this is other and you could do it in the visual auditory somatic. We don't show the do nothing bored 'cause it's nothing.

And this box tells you the four kinds of information you can extract from these boxes their strategies for formal practice their ways of classifying cutting up the pie of sensory experience their ways of formulate of figuring out applications for certain jobs in the world? How can I deal with this? How can I do deal with that you can formulate your strategies at your tool kit and also it gives you a detail view of the history.

That's a a sundial you remember that, we went through this whole thing and we outlined the whole history of world contemplation based on these categories, so these are the four types of information you can extract from the game boards.

Uh.

So details about this.

Details about this.

What up here details about Mister Happy Head?

OK.

What surface happiness?

Avoiding pain getting pleasure, avoiding pain? What's deep happiness experiencing pleasure times, mindfulness and what instead of avoiding pain, you can experience pain divided by mindfulness, reducing suffering.

What does the mine want it want stuff to shine it's light on all these different problems but what does it really want to shine it's light?

And the socket that it's connected to what you think you want is to avoid.

Don't know mine, but what you really want is to be able to experience don't remind us and empowerment what? What you think you want, which is valid is good situations, sunny weather. Not bad weather. But what you really want because it leads to these things is positive behavior.

So if you get this for yourself, you're going to be very happy. You asked me what's the definition of enlightenment, so this is a figure with a :) but the outline is very diffuse. There's no separation between inside and outside Thingness to separate.

And the consequences of that is that you want to serve you want to serve materially. You want to serve by this is a mouth teaching mindfulness mouth, not fit you give Donna you support those that serve materially and you support. Those we teach so this gives you more information about this now, let's go deep.

This is deep this is basics.

Detail detail detail this is just for decoration.

But but it's sort of cool because this reminds us that our sensory experiences again young thing.

And we see that in detail over here.

This reminds us that our path. I techniques at a deep level arise through an interplay. Maybe not exactly in Jan. But there's a little expensive contract. If so this reminds us of the deep view over here. This is practice. This is the deep view of practice. The interplay of active versus passive work with the parts work with the whole make discriminations break discriminations.

Manifest itself.

Go into the Nosa.

So this is.

This is the sort of the yen. Yang, the inner game of practices here and the sort of yin. Yang of sensory experience. The basic molding forces. The tug of subjective versus object if activation. The surface manifestations of expansion and contraction. The deep manifestations of expansion and contraction and the effortless activity of time itself rising and passing simultaneously.

These are the forces superficial and deep that mold sensory experience, so this.

This is this is the doorway to the deep view on this. This is the doorway to the deep view on this and this is the doorway to the deep view on the universe.

Displayed here.

The.

The title of the universe is.



Omega.

Which is that like that related to the Cosmo logical constant that big it's the number it's the interplay of expansion and contraction that molds the universe as a whole. Then the universe is at the finer scale. The smallest times smaller spatial scale is the plank and then this thing with the dot. This Sir component represents all the structures that arise in between the universe as a whole.

And the Planck scale the cosmic space scale and they plunk spatial scale. There's all these structures. That sort of seem to reflect a contract if Corrine expensive cloud or something along those lines and what are they galaxies supermassive black hole in the center effusive cloud of stars sons? We talked about it or an in between the expansion of thermal photon pressure in the contraction of self gravity.

Planets.

Core mantle atmosphere interactions cause certain in and out of the core and mantle cause. This surface continents to flow rising and falling of thermal currents caused the weather to flow.

The human being anatomically.

Scott asleep but it's got nerves that input this process in the brain.

Motor goes out.

The heart.

And the Kappel Aries, it's an expansion contraction thing, we have similar kind of structure and in our complicated of all creatures. We are the ones that are most aware of the input output in terms of cause and effect. So we live very much in that world. Also, the cell. I gave a whole talk about how this cell is formed by lipid bilayer.

OK, with the with a polar ends sticking out into the watery environment on the outside and the watery environment on the inside.

Creating an inside outside situation, then macro molecules like proteins with nonpolar core.

And surrounded by polar atoms are polar radicals. And So what did those polar radicals do well. They can migrate into this membrane and start to create very complex interactions that are input output of energy and matter and information into the cell.

That same sort of deal contractive core surrounded by this Halo and then atoms work very much in some ways like galaxies and at the base of it.

Is the mathematics?

The operations of mathematics.

Which all have the same basic structure just different flavor? It's an intertwining of 3 kinds of polarizing and canceling activities. You have movement you have you have?

Step forward step back, don't move you have stretch out pull in.

Don't move you have world this way world that way don't move.

All the movements of the dancer.

Are represented by the mathematics and?

Therefore the

The fact that the mathematics seems to have this polarization cancellation type of situation.

Shouldn't surprise us because we've discovered it in our own sensory experience seems to be something very fundamental about the way so it's sort of at the base of what models all of this there was a famous bio famous bio mathematician named how Dane HALDNE as an Englishman and this was back and I guess the Victorian Oregon.

Guardian period. Maybe not quite that old, but back there early 19th century, he was active someone once asked him.

Based on his study of mathematics and biology had, he been able to discern any characteristics of the creator.

Could you say anything about God's personality based on development of this field of file mathematics and he said yes as far as I can see the main characteristic of God is that he has an inordinate fondness for beetles.

But actually I would paraphrase how they?

I think God has an inordinate.

Fondness for

By contrast, and cancellation.

That seems to be the pattern.

Let me see very broadly.

And that is everything important that I know.

I hate you.

No.
