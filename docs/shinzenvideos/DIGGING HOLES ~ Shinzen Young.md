We can say you know what my path to enlightenment.

Is going to be see it?

That's it theoretically you could do that.

Assuming you have had enough image activity to warrant that.

And then it's all about the see him.

It's about having a complete experience of CN.

So complete that it bores a hole through the time space Continuum and.

The whole.

The whole field just gets sucked into that nirvanic black hole through CN alone.

Could you do that in theory? Yes.

Could you do that with any of these atoms in theory yes? Could you do that with any of the modalities or any of the themes.

Yeah, you could.

Because remember appreciation, which is just my poetic way of saying Experience Mindfully.

Uh.

Appreciation.

And experience mindfully is experience with concentration clarity and equanimity.

So quick way of saying all of that appreciation taken to its limit the under certain threshold.

Of skill.

Appreciation becomes transcendence.

At points to the formless.

So that is just say that, although we have the possibility of working at using this sort of microscope with three magnification pieces, Adams systems. Everything that is not to say you have to do that. It's just to say that a person could do that.

Now you probably heard the expression Oh well, you should you shouldn't dig a hole lot of holes you should just take one deep Oh.

Well.

Um.

For some People that's probably true.

You should just.

Have one thing and just stick with that, but not inevitably and I would rather use a different metaphor. Then the lot of shallow holes, which is pejorative. I would say you can learn a couple of ways, one ways, yeah, OK did all the way down.

From the form to the formless.

1 hole.

But you're still going to have to deal with all the rest of this stuff.

It gets dealt with by getting sucked down that hole, but there's still that process. Technique was you never do anything but this but still all this stuff has to be dealt with.

Through that technique.

Who is Nirvana means?

That the hope you you literally fold up the board the games over for awhile anyway. You fold up the board and goes into the closet.

Oh don't worry, it will come out again.

Uh.

So instead of the Pejorative Ova, Oh, you're digging a lot of shallow holes. Let's use a different metaphor.

You've got a backhoe and you're just clearing the whole field to a certain level and then you clear the whole field to another level until when you finally get to.

Bottom.

Then there's no where in the surface that isn't now contacting the bottle.

So just another way to think about the working.

OK wait are strategies to work So what strategy should you use? What's fun and interesting and productive for you is which strategy to use?
