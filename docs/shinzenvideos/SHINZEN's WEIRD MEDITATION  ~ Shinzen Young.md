So I've been told that People like it when I talk about myself, my own experiences and things like that. So just for the heck of it since I listen to your reports about your meditation for what it's worth it be interested in hearing my report about my meditations. Now, this is just one person's experience so remember so.

The danger in this is to think well that's you know that's

That's what shinzen does so that's what I should be doing, but not.

Mount the case profoundly not the case.

My.

Standard answer to the question what how should I meditate you know what? What's my standard answer primer whatever works.

Mom claims are made.

IT systems have strong points and weak points and even a given individual may relate to one system. At one point in their spiritual itinerary. They may relate to quite a different way of working later on, so I'm not about to.

Give I want to avoid giving the impression that there's a certain way that everybody should be doing practice.

So I had a really intense, and unusual experience during the process as I was guiding you and meditation in your practice today.

So I wasn't following my own guidance.

I got off on this other riff, OK and So what happened was is.

That I was.

Sort of doing a version of outer see rest OK, so that's the like. Looking out, but not at sort of the D focusing of the eyes that you know about. But I did a variation on it. It was sort of like a combination of see out and see rest in the sense that I.

I experimented to see.

House with making a very, very small aperture. But just enough of an aperture that pretty vivid patches of color would appear OK.

Um.

And so it was sort of like see out because it was color, but it was right on the cusp of.

This urge to look at it as an object right on the cusp So what I saw was this field of patches of different colors that was.

The room and all you folks.

And then and then I Sorta.

Collapse the distance between me and those color patches.

And those color patches where like paper, thin, but very vivid. It was like really you know it's interesting the word in Sanskrit Rupa.

Is ambiguous it means both color and form?

So it means color it means form, but it also means matter in the sense of Materi Ality and you have to be a little careful it when reading traditional Buddhist literature that sometimes.

Like in the phrase Nama Rupa in this case, Rupa means matter as opposed to an AMA which is Mont.

But in other cases, it literally means color or form, etc.

So I was looking at Rupa in the sense of just patches of color.

Uh.

So it was like really vivid.

Bright.

But like paper sil.
