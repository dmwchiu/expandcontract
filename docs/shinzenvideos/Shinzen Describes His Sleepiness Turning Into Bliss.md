Uhm actually I got really sleepy during the afternoon set today.

You know, I mean, I've been doing this for decades, and decades and I learned something new every single time.

Uh.



It's it's amazing So what I did is.

I got really physical with it, it was just like the physical sensations of sleepiness and I did. The thing that I described in the group process this morning about zoom in and zoom out so the primary was one primary here and one primary here, I get this sort of yucky sensation. Here then I get this painful. Yanni hypoxemia sensation here, so zoomed into the center and then I.

I was able to have this expansive concentration where I could really feel the whole body at once. I mean, like really in a lot of detail but just that one flavor. The sleepiness flavor, so like zoom in and then cover the whole thing and do the same thing here man about halfway through the sit.

It just

It just turned into this like slow lava lamp thing.

And it just got like really integrated and really blissful.

So anyway, so you know.

In gotta make a start somewhere and you learn and then you learn more and you learn more and you grow with it.
