Question yes, you could you could find which mean by enlightenment in this case history metric stream entry to find that for long, long, long piece on the Internet on my YouTube channels, but you would like the executive summary executive summary is.

That.

You have a kind of let's see that you realize that there is no thing inside you call the self.

Sometimes that realization happens suddenly and you can read about that invokes like 3 pillars of Zen. They've got all these testimonials in there about People for whom it happened really suddenly but it's my experience that it usually sneaks up on People. Sometimes they don't realise quite realize how enlightened they become because they gradually acclimatise but the Buddhist definition of Enlightenment is that you realize that there's never been a thing inside you called itself.

Now there is certainly an activity inside you called a personality and paradoxically the more clearly you realize that there's nothing inside. You call itself more freed up the wave inside you called personality becomes.

That would be the executive summary.
