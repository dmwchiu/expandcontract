There are.

Many ways.

2.

Come to optimal happiness.

Um.

You can.

Carefully observed phenomena.

Break them down into finer and finer distinctions until you see the vibrant void.

That is their nature.

That's sort of the observing and we use that a lot here.

There is a another strategy that can be successful.

Um.

Which is more than nurture positive kind of thing?

If you go all the way.

And develop a?

Absorption level of concentration on positive image talk and emotional body.

You literally become that and your former identity passes away.

Or at least is suspended for awhile so I reckon that at least in theory.

Nurture positive could be a path.

2 radical freedom and in fact.

It is this is one of the major claims of a driana practice in Tibet that the so-called deity yoga practices.

They're not just concentration exercises.

They are a

Component by component replacement of the inner see here of the ordinary human see, hear feel with alternate archetypal identity.

The reason to do it is not to go insane to think that you're a myth. The reason to do it is not. It's not show monic possession. It's a very different critter. It's done systematically in order to gain insight into the arbitrary nature of self identification.

Um.

So part of my.

Of the influences on me in.

Developing the way of teaching that I teach well. I'm very influenced by early Buddhism that took the divide and conquer strategy.

Um.

Which is OK, you break it down into pieces of pieces and eventually you sort of know it to death and love it to death. An you become free the IT in this case is self.

Uhm OK, so that's what sort of leads to the focus in approach that I use.

Um.

However, the nurture positive working explicitly with image talk, emotional body am in Vajrayana. You also work with the physical body by making Moodar's.

Um.

Working with those components if you develop enough concentration. That's why they call Aditi yoga, yoga has many meanings. One of the meanings is exercise another meaning of yoga is merging.

Or becoming

So you merge with.

You actually become the archetypal content that you create and as I say it's not to go insane. And it's not too. Shaaban eccle channel something it's to gain insight into the arbitrary nature of self identification. If it's like playing with with with identity like with Lego toys. It's like a Tinker toy kit.

You put one identity together they take it apart. Now then you put another one together. Then you take it apart is it's not just one deity yoga, it's like a sequence of deities.

An I take that as a pathic could in theory, give you insight into no self so that's a whole way of working.

Then there's sort of.

Zen, which has a lot of different aspects to it, which I won't go into but one just one of the aspects in Zen is.

A merging of inside and outside by pouring all your attention on the physical sight, physical sound physicality of the body. There's only so much real estate in consciousness, so if all the water sloshes out that inner world.

Contracts and vanish is.

And you merge you become one with.

What was formerly out?

So that's a way of working then there's a whole other approach, which might be called.

The meditation of no meditation.

Where you simply drop all effort 8?

That contrasts.

With the other ways of working right you can.

Take the components of self and untangle them and see their vibrant.

Void nature or you can merge with an archetype the ordinary identity contracts a mythic identity expands.

Once again, you get insight into the arbitrary nature of self identification or you can merge out see out here out feel out.

Um.

But those all require effort.

Particularly the deity yoga, type practice you're having to actually create intentionally the image that talk, the body sensations and so forth.

So very contrasting with that is OK drop, all effort so that's a do nothing kind of approach that works for some People well.

Um.

Are contrasting approach to all of the above?

Which.

I don't normally do as part of the system. But it's definitely something that is powerful and something to look into if you're interested is this whole sort of self inquiry way of working.

Uh.

It's been discovered an rediscovered in different forms.

Different cultures different times.

Um.

It tends to be associated with some of the Hindu Advaita teachings. And so forth. There's some great great advisor teachers online that have really deep experience using this approach.

Um.

So.

In Sanskrit, it's called Optima V Chara, which are a means to investigate.

Ah, not money itself, but it also is another part of some of the Zen teachers who am I what are you?

In fact that was the koan.

That.

My very first teacher gave me a Camera Kacian said say that was the last time when he and I were together in Japan. I was going back to the US and he said, OK, here's your koan.

Who are you? What are you?

And.

It's like OK? How do I work on this koan?

Turn the light back on itself.

What do you mean?

Swim back to the source of the stream of consciousness what's that mean?

Just do it.

So that was sort of I'm paraphrasing but that was sort of the dialogue OK. There's not much you can. It's not an algorithm OK. It's like groping you're pushing back pushing back pushing back.

A question.

Cola, who am I or where does that come from or who sees you can choose any language that you want. There's a lot of ways to formulate the question the important thing to realize is.

This is Co-op work this is this is not an intellectual question that you're going to say.

Oh, I am and there's going to be a substantive an now you have answered that question that's not what this is about this is.



About.

Each arising of self you're trying to sort of metaphorically look over your shoulder and see where it came from.

Um.

As I say it could be formulated in a lot of different words, but the method is the same.

Essentia Lee, the same work very similar.

Uh.

For some People that ends up very much related to that, spacious thing, that we were doing where you start to get a sense that OK. I'm the space all around looking in that might be a stage that you pass through and you dis identify with the content of experience.

Um.

A good teacher of this method won't won't let you mistake.

A fixated sense of witness as the true self, though.

If it if it's at all fixated in space like OK. I'm over here kind of thing. Well, now, you need to look back a little further.

Um.

So interesting Lee It's not just in Hinduism and some of them.

Buddhist schools.

Of Zen, but you actually find this method or something a little like this used in some of the terrified of traditions where they're trying to sort of like inquire push it back push it back. I've seen some TB of teachers that teach this way.

And really interesting.

Is?

Some anonymous guy.

In the 15th century in England.

Hippopotamus.

Um.

An I would almost be certain that he hit upon it without anyone pointing it out to him. He just hit upon it just discovered it.

Um.

Do you know who I'm talking about? Is Anonymous, but there's a work of literature, he wrote that's the cloud of Unknowing.

A classic in both Catholicism and Anglicanism.

Um.

A Piscop Arian In other words, in there, you can see him struggling to try to describe something.

That had no tradition in Europe.

And.

But you could see it was really important for him, I should have prepared to show you the.

Section but I'm paraphrasing but it's something like.

Um.

Keep.



Keep beating away at the cloud of ignorance.

With the sword of.

Love of God.



Pushing back pushing back.

To understand to experience.

Your existence? What lies

Behind you moment by moment I'm paraphrasing maybe I'll go find the quote on the Internet. But it's something to that effect. It's very obvious that he's struggling to describe something like a self inquiry process.

Seems obvious to me anyway and I find it extraordinary that.

Someone would have hit upon this.

I independently and within the context of.

Or that was pre reformation, so within the context of Catholicism basically that's a whole other way of working.

And different the the approaches are it's nice because the approaches contrast, so each person can find one or a combination of these that they can relate to.

So there's a wide range of.

Ways that you can go back out and personally.

You know, some People are sort of Mono Spiritual.

There they do best with just one approach, but I find that a lot of People are BI or Multi. I certainly AM.

All those approaches to me seem like one approach.

Um.

I would say that the closest thing with in what I do.

To the self inquiry way of working.

Is?

Just not gone.

Can you see Why?

Can you see the parallelism?

What's what's the question that self inquiry? Asked where does it come from?



What's the question that just not gone answers?



And answers the question where does it go to?

'Cause you're you're developing an appreciation for where things go to when they disappear.

Now I know initially.

So gone is defined.

Very very carefully with in my system.

All or part of something abruptly subsides and you notice it. That's the definition of gone and you might wonder.

Want to set up such a weird definition, whi language, it that way.

Well.

Uh.

Where something goes to when it disappears?

Is the same place it comes from when it where a goes to win it vanish? Is is where becomes from?

In the next instant.

When it manifests.

So.

An inquiry method you're sort of OK a has arisen where did it come from.

You're trying to set up look back.

To the source of the stream.

Turn the light back on itself turn consciousness back on itself or a very common paradigm be conscious of consciousness.

Um.

So the gone is a just disappeared.

And if you

If you briefly look in that direction.

You're going to see that that's where B is going to pop out of.

On.



And what is it?

Well.

It's emptiness.

That's what that's the tranquil side.

Of the process.

So that's one side of emptiness.

Um.

And then the dynamic side of the process.

Is how emptiness breaks apart?

It happens to everyone hundreds of thousands of times a day.

Um.

We just it's so subtle.

We just don't notice it by large.

But.

The nothing which.

Is not extended in time and space?

It breaks apart.

And that happens with a kind of bouncy's spontaneity.

OK.

Just happens.

Um.

And.

There's a sense of space effortlessly spreading.

And at the same time, there's a sense of space effortlessly collapsing.

In terms of traditional Tera Vaada Formulations.

They talk about Diaby A or rising passing.

At some point you're.

Awareness is dominated by this cyclic sense of there's just rising and passing and your real detached from the content.

It's just risings passings risings passing some of its pleasant. Some of its unpleasant. Some of it makes sense. Some of it doesn't make sense, but you're you have a sense that you're in contact with some primordial ordering principle that is a pre human order.

The Order of nature.

Human order is my body is comfortable and my minds got answers.

This Prehuman Order is.

What proceeds

Free Energie Entropy Maybe.

That's my guess.

Um.

That's what causes things to protect your summer polity to fall up into existence.

So.

There is a stage comes.

And typically.

You pass through this stage.

10,000 times in a lifetime, but it just becomes clearer and clearer and clearer with each new challenge level. You sort of have to go through the same thing again.

That's one way to look at progress is a lot of different ways to map progress, but one is OK. Can you be in on a rising passing situation with this level of pain in your leg OK? Well, how about the next level of pain in your leg. Well, how about taking your heart. Well, how about how about how about how about how about an when you reach the point where it doesn't matter how big or complex or what the content is but you can instantly.

Be in on a rising passing situation.

Um then you're doing pretty good.

However.

After the arising passing thing.

Or on a continuum innocence with that.

Is a sense of passing as its arising?

No sooner is it arising but it's already passing this is described in the classic Ovie city mug off the path of purification written by put the Cosa so also described by the Anglican poet. TS Eliot in my beginning is my end.

That's how one of his lines open in my beginning is my end. It's like already dying as soon as it's born.

That is that taking a temporal slice.

As soon as it's arising it's already passing.

But spatially that means as soon as it's spreading it's already collapsing.

Because remember sensory events occupy timespace volumes.

They last for a period of time and they have with depth and height.

Check it out, we did it in the group process does your sear feel not have with depth and height. It does so as soon as spreading in terms of with depth and height. It's already collapsing along all three of those dimensions.

So that's sort of the.

The extreme version of arising passing is like passing as its arising.

Spreading effortlessly as its collapsing effortlessly.

Um.

And in the folds of that vibrant dense of space.

Are born?

Um.

The inner and outer see, hear feel.

That create the surrounding seen experience.

And the

I have a self looking out at the surrounding seen experience.

They.

There's a metaphor from the vigiano vow to school.

Based on a snail OK.

Uh.

The snails eyes.

They belong to the same snail OK.

But.

They come out on these 2 different stocks.

And then they can actually face each other consciousness.

Comes from one formless source.

Anne its visual auditory somatic, but half of it seems out and the other half seems in but it's really just consciousness looking at consciousness.

So.

Ah.

Those sensory experience.

Arise in the vibrating folds in between this effortless spread and collapse of space.

So that sense of.

Space effortlessly spreading and collapsing.

That's the dynamic side of emptiness.

And then at some point.

That.

That process sort of comes to an end.

Expansion and contraction cancel out.

And it's a flat line, but that's not the right metaphor. It's it all collapses back down to.

The next gone.

Um.

So.

Sometimes People like to talk about non dual I mentioned that term few minutes ago advaita non too.

So non dual.

Is another way to say 1?

Or it's another way to.

To say healing.

A a wound healing.

An alienation healing a cleft.

That separates

So there's a lot of.



Healings that have to take place.

One is the seeming separation of inside and outside.

If you were listening carefully to what I said, You should have an idea of how.

That that duality could be transcended.

And to transcend the duality of inside and outside that's no small thing.

What are some of the ways?

Well, I actually mentioned a few of them.

One is

You can allow out to expand.

While in contracts In other words, the see out here out feel out of the surrounding seen you pour all your attention on that.

So much so that the CN here, and feeling of the reactive self.

Contracts to nothing.

And then your identity just goes out and inhabits what was formerly other that's one way to go about it.

On another way to go about it is.

The outer seen arises and there's a reactive self. It also arises.

However, there's so much habitual concentration clarity and equanimity in those circuits.

That both the outer scene and the.

In herself.

Arise as a waveform.

And.

So the 2:00 waves completely interpenetrate.

And there is a Oneness of inside and outside as a kind of unified dance of Energi.

That's another way that you can have a?

You can breakdown the duality between inside and out.

One of the major paradigms.

Of Enlightenment,

In World Mysticism is.

The Oneness.

Um.

In Dallas terms, it tends to be Oneness of inside and outside in theist. IDK religions, it tends to be Oneness of the soul with God.

Um.

How old do you experience oneness of the soul with God?



Well.

How 'bout experiencing yourself arising in between the 2 sides of God moment by moment that would do the trick?

Especially if it's your screwed up self.



That would be really good.

Up.

To experience you're screwed up self being loved into existence.

By the dance of space moment by moment.

It's pretty good might help you.

Be a little more loving of your screwed himself.



The 2:00

Achieve a sense of Oneness of inside and outside.

Is admirable?

But I would say that.

It's not the deepest experience of nondual.

The deepest experience of non dual.

Comes about

When the

Duality or separation.

Between the

One nothing.

And the 10 trillion something.

When that

Separation.

Is healed?

That's real nanteuil awareness.

Um.

What in the world is he talking about?

So.

The one nothing that is the source that's what gone points, too.

That's also what you see when you're successful in self inquiry.

I need.

See where you come from?

You see where you got.

That's the one nothing.

Um.

Then there's the 10 trillion somethings of self and world.

Another way to put it is.

Emptiness and form so the heart. Sutra says she group Rupam should Natasha in your type of Rupa form is emptiness emptiness is form.

Now it's very interesting, they put it both ways.

Form is emptiness emptiness is form.

That is the entire path.

Viewed from one point of view.

It's only one point of view, but that's the entire path right there.

The first half of the path is form is emptiness.

That's dissolution that's

Loving and knowing form to death.

Um within the

Jewish meditation tradition, it's called Betul Hi Ash.

The annihilation of the something.

Don't be afraid of it.

Don't be afraid to just sit there.

An totaly let go of the ordinary ordering principle.

The ordinary human ordering principle, which I reiterate? What did I say the human ordering principle is body is comfortable and Ynez answers. Now I'm not.

Saying that there's anything wrong with the normal human ordering principle in fact, we're humans.

Mostly that's what we need but.

We also need a larger context.

A pre human ordering.

The source of the human ordering presumably.

Um.

So.

Don't be afraid to just.

Let it all collapse into what seems to be chaos.

Because what's interesting is what?



What seems to be random?

Is in fact what? What causes order to arise?

Entropy.

Um.

So you sort of surrender to that.

Um.

And.

You let this something this just be torn apart.

And you throw caution to the wind.

And for a period of time abandoned.

Totale.

The ordinary ordering principle.

Doesn't matter if the bodies comfortable or not doesn't matter if my mind is confused or not?

Annihilation of the something nahs.

And what will happen is it will all become rising passing right arising passing and then it would just be passing passing and.

Um.

Then.

You will.

Began to see how that nothing.

Molds each moment.

Um.

And each moment is one of the 10 trillion somethings.

That I'm alluding to the 10 trillion somethings of self and world.

This is happening here, I'm experiencing this here. My mind is doing. This my body is doing this, they're doing that were over here.

It's 10 trillion somethings.

That constitute a life.

Um.

How can we connect?

Have an unbroken on dual.

Link.

Between the one nothing over here.

And the 10 trillion somethings.

Well, this is about the deepest principle that I am personally aware of in practice.

Um.

What the umbilical cord the thing that allows for a smooth and continuous transform?

From the one nothing to one of the 10 tree and some things back to the one nothing.

What connects is the 2 doings?

The two doings are the 2 sides of emptiness.

Space.

Effortlessly spreading and collapsing.

They are the 2 sides of 0.

And in the falls.

Is?

Arise is one of the 10 trillion somethings.

And whatever it is I thought a body sensation a site a sound.

Whatever it is.

It's always embraced from, without and within.

By the 2 doing.

So it.

The ordinary experience.

Is touched?

By the 2:00 doings, but the 2:00 doings are in fact.

The 2 sides of the one nothing.

And that allows you to have an experience.

Thousands and thousands of times a day.

Of.

This.

Merin culas.

Arising of something from nothing.



Form is emptiness.

That's The Path.

Of the solution.

Emptiness is form.

If you are heroic enough to do that.

You get to live the rest of your life.

Seeing.

Each.

He.

Sensory event as this kind of miracle.

That arises.



Sitting on the totality of the of the universe.

Seems like you're participating in that process.

And in the Hebrew that's called?

Briard year, Schmidt iron.

The continuing continuous creation of Yesh things met from iron the divine nothingness.

That's

A spontaneous fancy process.

And.



Because of that.

You.

Lookup on each thing as sort of.

Sharing your womb.

And.

In the Jewish tradition.

At least the Jewish Mystical tradition.

It is said that.



Through that participation.

Comes about something called T Kuhn, orlaam them, ending of the world.
