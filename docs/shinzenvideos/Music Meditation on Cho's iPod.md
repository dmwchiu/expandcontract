Gives an example when he started doing music meditation.



First, People to your iPod alot.

Cutest explain a little bit about what's happening on your iPod in Washington, referring them, too.



Sure, music is very, very important in my life, I.

When my house is empty. I fill it with music not always but you know when you have a household of People and then they leave. It's like I can listen to my own music now, so I found I love classical music an when he teaches the music meditation. He will use a technique of banishing are gone, he uses the rest and he uses the active states. I don't know if I were still using that term, but active states So what I did is I went through my classical music and I.

Categorized it things that had for instance, the gone. You know, those moments when no sound. And so then you can note the gone. So I have about 4:00 or 5 pieces on my iPod that I've labeled meditation music gone and then I have four five pieces that are rest States and four five pieces for pure sound. Now somebody else might not. Find those pure sound, but to me, they fill me so that I can just.

The The Sound.

And I've actually loaned my iPod to many People and they've taken them off, so it's.

Especially use it when I'm flying.

Ours is going to say how are you using it primarily when I'm flying when I want to relax when I want pure sound and as be the music too.

To take myself out of the marketplace that's when I use it.
